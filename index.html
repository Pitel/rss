Like most anime, English dubs roll out much later to ensure the best translations for the final version. Although details about Dragon Ball Daima&#x27;s English dub were scarce, we finally got word of a release date.

                              <span>Phasmophobia dev Kinetic Games has a lot to celebrate right now. The console version of the four-player co-op horror game made it to consoles near the end of October, and just a little over a month later, it&#x27;s already hit over one million copies sold.


This unit count spans PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, and Xbox Series X|S, all of which launched the Early Access version of the game on October 29, 2024. It&#x27;s also been over four years since Phasmophobia first launched on PC. Adding those numbers in pushes cumulative sales toward the 22 million mark.




Kinetic Games CEO and development lead Daniel Knight commented on the achievement in a press release. &quot;This incredible achievement is only possible thanks to our wonderful, supportive, and engaged community,&quot; he said. Knight added that the milestone is &quot;the best Christmas present we could have wished for.&quot;  


Reviews for Phasmophobia continue to stay in the &quot;Overwhelmingly Positive&quot; zone over on Steam, where the horror game once peaked at 112,241 players. Over the last 30 days, it has enjoyed an average of over 21,000 concurrent daily players, thanks in no small part to ongoing support from the developers. The latest major update, Crimson Eye, launched with new events, upgraded physics, and more in October. 


For those looking to get in on the scares, Phasmophobia supports cross-play for teaming up with others across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.

                              <span>As a sysadmin I used to work under used to say, “Everything works until it breaks.” That goes for live service games which are reliant on various, well, services and servers to function. The Bazaar is no exception, so here’s how you can get the latest for when it’s down.


Currently, The Bazaar is more vulnerable than most, as Tempo’s hero builder is still in its closed beta period as of October 30, 2024. To even get access to it, you need to have purchased the Founder’s Pack.


The game goes down frequently at this point in time due to maintenance. At the time of writing, it was down up until a few minutes ago following 2-3 hours of work being done to patch the game. So, it’s not uncommon to see a message when trying to log in that you are unable to connect.


How to check if The Bazaar is down


Right now, Tempo doesn’t have a site setup to track the status of its services, so there’s no real-time tracker of problems. So, that sucks. But there are a few sources that you can turn to that should have recent-ish information on them.


The first is through the developers themselves (or spokespeople), who post on both Twitter and Bluesky. Their updates are rather frequent and timely, at least when it comes to planned maintenance.


But perhaps the best place to check is The Bazaar’s Discord server. You can use this link here or search for “playthebazaar” to connect. This is sometimes the better choice since you’re not merely relying on the developer to announce when outages happen, since you can ask the community if anyone else is having issues at that moment.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no denying that Elden Ring is one of the best and most successful video games that FromSoftware has ever made. As a result of this reputation, some fans are hoping that a sequel is already in development, but it seems that the studio has other plans.


Earlier today, Elden Ring&#x27;s DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree won the Grand Award at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2024 Japan Asia. As reported by IGN Japan (and translated by Automaton Media) Hidetaka Miyazaki, the iconic president of FromSoftware and the director of Elden Ring &amp; many other games, answered some questions about the future of the company to the press.

                              <span>Calisto Besatt is a boss in Enigma of Fear, and he might take a few attempts to beat. Once he’s taken down, however, the challenge won’t necessarily end. You may wind up stuck in a loop, fighting him over and over until you give up in frustration. That’s where this guide comes in. Just what are you supposed to do after defeating Calisto?


Caught in a loop after beating Calisto Besatt?


After bringing Calisto Besatt to his knees in Enigma of Fear, a short cutscene plays that provides the clue about what you need to do next. A mysterious figure opens a hidden door in a nearby wall and presumably makes off with Verity’s unconscious body.

When he awakens, you’ll realize that he’s been chained to some kind of altar. You can interact with each chain, but there’s not much else to do. Interact with his torso to return to what looks like the main menu. Don’t worry; it&#x27;s not a glitch. Enter the blue three-symbol code that you used at the very beginning of the game, and you’ll wind up back in Mia’s story.


Don’t interact with the paper


Here’s where you might mess up. The note that started all of this is still lying tantalizingly on the floor in the center of the room, but interacting with it again will just take you back to Verity’s timeline. You’ll have to fight Calisto again, wake up on the altar, enter the code... This can happen endlessly in a loop. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


Instead, turn around, equip the crowbar, and whack at the wall directly behind Mia. She’ll bust through the stone and uncover the hidden door from the cutscene. This will take you to an intermediate zone dubbed simply the Underground/Underworld. You’ll wind up in the Perimeter, the hub area of Enigma of Fear, fighting more Blood Zombies.

                              <span>Following up on July&#x27;s Early Access launch, a release date is now in place for the full version of Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable. You&#x27;ll be able to get up close and personal with those colossal monstrosities when the Complete Edition drops on December 17.


Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable Complete Edition will be available via the Meta Quest Store for Meta Quest 2, 3/3S, and Pro. It arrives alongside the launch of Part 2, which continues the virtual Titan slaying with the final two chapters. There&#x27;s also a new two-player co-op mode, giving players a chance to join the Scout Regiment and topple Titans together. 


Check out some more first-person ODM gear movement, including an attempt at taking down the Armored Titan, in the new trailer below. 




Part 1 is currently available for $4.99, and will remain at that price until Part 2 launches. Starting December 17, Part 1 will go up to $7.99 and Part 2 will be available for $12. That adds up nicely to the full cost of the Complete Edition, which will run would-be Scouts a cool $19.99.


While it contains the final chapters, there&#x27;s more on the way for Attack on Titan VR beyond the 1.0 launch. UNIVRS teased some additional content for the future, including Survival Mode and a limited-time Global Challenge event that lets players work together to unlock the Thunder Spear weapon. 


The fact that these VR final chapters are continuing in some way sounds a lot like Attack on Titan as a whole package! The manga and the anime are both over, but even the Final Chapters weren&#x27;t able to rest for long. The new Attack on Titan: THE LAST ATTACK compilation film recently packed those concluding chapters into one whopper of a 145-minute feature in Japan on November 8.

                              <span>After some delay, the Halloween update has finally arrived in Sol’s RNG. In this new update, a new currency, Pump Token, is introduced that you can use to buy new items. Pump Token looks like a coin that has Jack o&#x27; Lantern&#x27;s face in the center. Here’s a comprehensive guide on everything you need to know about the Pump Token in Sol’s RNG.

The only way to get the Pump Tokens is by collecting pumpkins. There are two main ways to collect pumpkins: doing daily missions and gathering pumpkins on the ground. 


You can get 150 pumpkins on a single daily mission. Once you&#x27;ve collected enough pumpkins, head over to the Jack NPC and sell them off for 1 Pump Token per pumpkin.

With respect to the soundtrack, it feels like a wasted week. Thankfully, this week is one that appeared in my list of 10 Game soundtracks that need to be added to Nintendo Music, Splatoon 2.


We already got Splatoon 3, which is fine. It features some songs from fictional band Off The Hook. However, Splatoon 2 features the most songs from Off the Hook since that’s the game that the duo, Marina and Pearl, MC’d. I like the Squid Sisters, I’m not big on Deep Cuts, but I love Off the Hook. And now, based on the artist playlist (because the app credits fictional artists but not the real composers), we’re at 36 minutes of Off the Hook, which is probably as good as we’ll get until Splatoon 4…</span>

This was done, as GSC claims, due to performance concerns, and it&#x27;s a believable argument for sure.


This information is the first time GSC Game World has officially commented on the status of A-Life 2.0 in STALKER 2, short of acknowledging the fact that it&#x27;s broken beyond belief. It comes from a recent interview with IGN, where studio heads Maria and Ievgen Grygorovych went in-depth on their reasoning for cutting the feature down. 


&quot;We were fighting with optimization,&quot; said Ievgen. &quot;To optimize, you have a lot of things that need your resources, and you try to cut things from different directions to prop…</span>

It’s really nice of Sega and Two Point Studios to have remembered, especially since it’s one of my most anticipated games. As, truly, any game in the Two Point series probably would be.


It’s not that I particularly love museums, either, though I do enjoy them, as should anyone who enjoys massaging their brain matter. I just really love the Two Point games. Two Point Hospital was a terrific modernization of/apology for 1997’s Theme Hospital. Two Point Campus was a deft continuation on a new subject matter. As far as management games go, Two Point Studios’ feel ripped from the golden age, which makes sense, since many of the developers there worked on some of the best ‘90s and ‘00s ge…</span>

He’s also shown up in a wide array of video games. Sadly, these games really aren’t worth playing. In fact, if you’re buying a game where Superman is the star, there’s a good chance you’ll come to regret that purchase within an hour of playing it. Developers can’t seem to crack the code to make a decent Superman game.

                              <span>Scratch that nostalgia itch with these Switch neo-classics.
Given that we&#x27;re approaching the holiday season, we thought it was high time we brought back this list of retro throwbacks to help fill up your Switch library in time for Christmas. We&#x27;ve rejigged this to our new format and added a fantastic trio of retro-style delights — Carpathian Night Starring Bela Lugosi, Crow Country, and Fear the Spotlight.

Ah, nostalgia — it&#x27;s a tricksy thing. How many times have we gone back to revisit a treasured classic only to find that modern games have spoiled it for us? For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we&#x27;re used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough.

Developer Mad Mimic and publisher Light Up Games have announced that the pirate metroidvania Mark of the Deep will be landing on Switch in January 2025.
You might remember that this one was initially scheduled for an October 2024 launch — a date which, obviously, wasn&#x27;t met — and while it&#x27;s never ideal to see a nice-looking game delayed, the new release window isn&#x27;t all that far away.

Marketing is such an important part of making a console a success. Even Reggie Fils-Aimé stated in his memoir that the idea for the &#x27;Wii Would Like to Play&#x27; campaign for the Nintendo Wii – which was initially shot down by Satoru Iwata – ended up being instrumental in the system&#x27;s rapid success in the US.
For the Switch, however, nobody is creating commercials like Nintendo Australia. In fact, in our humble opinion, Nintendo needs to get whoever is in charge of creating these advertisements and let them work their magic in every major region across the globe. They&#x27;re simply remarkable.

With December finally upon us, our minds have been drifting to the past 12 months, recalling what has been a surprisingly packed year of gaming. We&#x27;ve had surprise drops, indie hits and more than a few big names to tide over the Switch in its twilight year, but we can&#x27;t help but feel that something has been missing: where were the Directs?
Okay, we understand that, behind the scenes, Nintendo&#x27;s big guns have likely been full-steam ahead on &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; for the majority of the year (something confirmed by a glance at the list of developers for this year&#x27;s first-party line-up), but the showcase scarcity has been... noticeable.

Nintendo isn&#x27;t likely to reveal the highly-anticipated &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; before the end of 2024, but that apparently hasn&#x27;t stopped Chinese vendors from selling accessories for the console via wholesale platform Alibaba.
As spotted on Famiboards and reported by our friends over at Eurogamer, the accessories can be purchased in bulk and appear to have been produced based on accurate specifications for the upcoming Switch successor.

This week, a brand new Nintendo Switch Online Game Trial drops in Europe, and if you&#x27;ve been on the fence about checking out Wargroove 2, now is the time to pick it up.
From 5th to 11th December, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will be able to check out Chucklefish&#x27;s strategy sequel — which it co-developed with Robotality. We were big fans of it when it launched last year, and it&#x27;s a no-brainer if you&#x27;ve played the original Wargroove.

We&#x27;ve covered the sweet work of tech wizard BigRig Creates on Nintendo Life in the past (this is the designer behind the world&#x27;s largest working DS and its 3D counterpart), and this week he has caught our eye again with a colourful Pokémon-inspired build that has us looking at our bland Wii consoles in shame.
Inspired by a piece of art from @altardoll that imagined Gen I&#x27;s Porygon as a Nintendo Wii, BigRig decided to make the design a reality, and the results are expectedly awesome.

Sea of Stars launched on Nintendo Switch last year and, after a beefy free update and with an even beefier free DLC on the horizon, it&#x27;s safe to say that it&#x27;s a banger. But what inspired the developer, Sabotage, to make such a gem? What studios sit on its mood board? Who is the go-to touchstone for all things game-making? According to Sea of Stars director Thierry Boulanger, it&#x27;s Nintendo.
Now, we challenge any dev to look us in the eye and say that they haven&#x27;t, in some way, been inspired by the House of Mario over the years. But, as Boulanger told GamesRadar, the Big N is &quot;just the motherlode of everything you can learn&quot;, with the studio&#x27;s work in the 1980s and &#x27;90s being particular points of inspiration for the Sabotage team.

With Black Friday capping off last week, part of us expected the UK charts to be a little shaken up when we first peeked at the data this morning. But while there are some bumps in the later entries, the top ten remains as stable as ever... maybe we&#x27;ll see the discount ramifications next week.
Super Mario Party Jamboree is once again Nintendo&#x27;s top-performing title, landing in fourth. The familiar faces of Nintendo Switch Sports, Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe also nab a spot in the top ten, with Sonic X Shadow Generations sneaking in there with Switch making up the lion&#x27;s share of its sales.

Nabídne především tituly, které obecenstvo v běžné nabídce televizí nebo VOD platforem nenajde. Dnes v 18:00 kanál odstartoval kultovním snímkem Kouř režiséra Tomáše Vorla. Divačky a diváci se pak každý týden budou moci těšit na dva nové filmy, které se na novém kanálu objeví vždy v úterý a v pátek. Spolu s Kouřem nabídla Filmová klasika ještě další desítku filmů ke zhlédnutí.</span>

                              <span>When I downloaded Creeper World IXE&#x27;s demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a &quot;failure&quot; - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain&#x27;t 3D, and 2) it&#x27;s billed as an exercise in &quot;dominating&quot; the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.

                              <span>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It&#x27;s boring because it&#x27;s a &quot;solved game&quot; whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the &quot;perfect&quot; player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We&#x27;d be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

                              <span>“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

                              <span>We don&#x27;t know yet if the AI revolution of our reality will go full Skynet or simply end with the robots unceremoniously dumping us like a sad Joaquin Phoenix. But at least video games can help us speculate. Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a &quot;turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG&quot;, which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo.

Why, I could gaze through this wonderful window all day. Let’s just hope no-one decides to smash through it, eh? Why, I’d get bits of glass in my lovely warm milk, which would massively downgrade my biscuit-dunking experience. Wait. What’s that? Oh no!

                              <span>In response to a decision from Blizzard to pull the original Warcraft I &amp; II from GOG later this month, following the release of the remastered versions, GOG have updated their preservation policy. The real time strategy games will no longer be available to buy on the storefront from the 13th of December, but GOG have released a statement committing to maintaining and updating the games for existing owners as part of their preservation program. If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.
&quot;We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. &quot;Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important. With that in mind, we’ve decided to update one aspect of the GOG Preservation Program’s policy.&quot; Here&#x27;s the critical line in ceremonial blockquote attire:

Developer Summitsphere has announced that its upcoming Wario Land-inspired platformer Antonblast will be further delayed on the Nintendo Switch.
Although the game is still scheduled to launch on Steam on 3rd December 2024, it&#x27;s been determined that the Nintendo Switch version simply isn&#x27;t quite up to scratch. In a social media announcement, director Tony Grayson said &quot;We need more time to make sure that this version of the game is running at peak performance and meeting our own high standards, as well as Nintendo&#x27;s&quot;.

If you enjoy racing around a large, oval track in fast cars, then you might want to grab one of the Nascar games on Switch before they vanish into thin air.
Yes, thanks to an announcement from Motorsport Games (cheers, Nintendo Everything), titles from the NASCAR Heat and NASCAR Rivals franchises will be delisted from the Switch eShop from 31st December 2024. No reasoning behind the delisting was mentioned in the announcement, but it&#x27;s likely due to the transfer of the Nascar lisence from Motorsport Games to iRacing.

After a year of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom builds, we thought that we had seen just about everything Hyrule has to offer. But then we see someone has transformed the Gerudo Desert into Tattooine&#x27;s Podracing scene and, all of a sudden, we&#x27;re starting to wonder if we&#x27;ve even scratched the surface of what this game is capable of.
Forget Anakin Skywalker, Sebulba, Ben Quadinaros, Teemto Pagalies or any of the other hilariously-named racers from Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace, because there&#x27;s a new speedster in town: Link.

                              <span>Double trouble.
The Life is Strange series has been an interesting diversion from Square Enix’s typical MO of putting out endless takes on RPGs, instead offering heavily narrative-focused stories exploring the trials of various people who develop supernatural abilities. This series&#x27; strong storytelling has garnered a loyal fanbase, it’s also proven to be a bit uneven along the way.
The original Life is Strange followed the adventures of a time-bending teen named Max Caulfield, and its ending (whichever one you picked) was considered by its creators Dontnod to be the definitive end of Max’s story, as Life is Strange was intended to be a sort of anthology series and Dontnod introduced a new protagonist in Life is Strange 2. With development duties having shifted to Deck Nine, however, a direct sequel has now been produced that continues the story of an older Max who now lives in another part of the country. Despite its divisive premise, Life is Strange: Double Exposure does a solid job of exploring Max’s character further while introducing a new and interesting supporting cast, though it unfortunately feels like a clumsy fit for the Switch’s limited hardware.

                              <span>Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that makes video games smell. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream&#x27;s mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


&quot;But hold your horses, young Edwin,&quot; you sternly interject. &quot;I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick.&quot; Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge&#x27;s notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it&#x27;s known in the States - are rather in-depth. I&#x27;m still very glad I can&#x27;t smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

                              <span>Events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while devastating on the emotional wellbeing of hardware editors, are as useful for knocking a few more quid off already-cheap bits of gaming gear as they are for saving hundreds on big-ticket luxuries. It’s the re-bargainating aspect we must concern ourselves with here, as the Logitech G413 SE – already a premier choice of affordable mechanical gaming keyboard – is now more attainable still, dropping to £65 / $56.

                              <span>Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

                              <span>While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech&#x27;s worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

                              <span>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic, the Warsaw Pact-era city-building sim from 3DIVISION and Hooded Horse, is getting eight new maps scattered across the globe. These include a map set in the Eastern United States, from approximately New York State down to North Carolina, and another one set in Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s very own United Kingdom, where Karl Marx wrote most of his best stuff.
&quot;Nowhere is safe from having its economy meticulously managed in minute detail by discerning comrades,&quot; explains the announcement release. I for one welcome our new socialist overlords. It&#x27;s high time we sceptre-kissing Brits learned the importance of a properly joined-up sewage system. Looking at you, Thames Water. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

It’s a familiar and frustrating feeling for many Steam Deck owners. Luckily, there’s a solution!

                              <span>There is some spiteful drama in the Half-Life modding scene this week. The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: &quot;STOP talking SH1T about us&quot;. This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod&#x27;s code as &quot;anticitizens&quot;.

The 1TB model in particular is going mighty cheap, falling to $88 in the US and £67 in the UK.

                              <span>‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying &quot;we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own&quot;. &quot;You’re right!&quot; you respond. &quot;I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie&quot;. Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Chilling visions indeed. Good thing today is only Cyber Monday, meaning I can get away with spending a mere 80-85% of the day rounding up discounted PC hardware. Like this: this more powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme edition of the Asus ROG Ally, a handheld Windows PC that beats the Steam Deck on 720p games performance. With £100 off in the UK and £150 off in the States, it’s now a much closer match on price as well.

                              <span>Last week, Brendy left a note in our weekly Maw liveblog about a player-made map of Caves Of Qud, the reportedly excellent sci-fi roguelike RPG that lets you &quot;chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations&quot;, represented as 2D Dwarf Fortress-esque layouts. Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator&#x27;s casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
&quot;Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?&quot; I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn&#x27;t sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

                              <span>One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it&#x27;s worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

                              <span>To your stations, colleagues! December has ambushed us like a hideous hairy man in a red bobble hat, and time is of the essence. In just a handful of weeks, Horace the Endless Bear shall strike the brazen gong labelled &quot;Happy holidays&quot; and atomise the world, that it may be born anew in 2025. Before that, we must heap the Maw high with any remaining new video games or video game news from 2024. Find below a few new PC releases for the pile. I thought it was going to be a quiet week, but it&#x27;s actually quite a boisterous haul.

                              <span>Trouble continues for some of the largest pirate sites specializing in Asian entertainment. Coinciding with the shutdown of Dramacool, GogoAnime and Anitaku stopped uploading new content. This weekend, AnimeFenix added to the trouble with a &#x27;voluntary&#x27; shutdown citing more copyright pressure. &quot;Piracy will never go away as long as there are companies with more greed than heart,&quot; the AnimeFenix team notes in its farewell message.

Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good&#x27;un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

                              <span>Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it&#x27;s still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It&#x27;s pronounced &quot;Trese&quot;) nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I&#x27;m about ready to start recommending it.
I&#x27;m a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren&#x27;t bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn&#x27;t yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

                              <span>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it&#x27;s part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector&#x27;s gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

                              <span>To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

                              <span>As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

                              <span>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in Selaco. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she&#x27;s over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

                              <span>Seeing great games sell too poorly for the pursestring goblins to shell out for a sequel is always a heartache, but it really stung to learn that the incredible Dead Space remake didn’t catch on enough for EA to greenlight a remake of Dead Space 2 (even if EA were a little spotty on the details). Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

                              <span>In many ways, the SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL and Apex Pro TKL are about as different as tenkeyless gaming keyboards get: the first is a budget-friendly membrane ‘board, the second a luxurious all-mechanical number with adjustable switches and its own little OLED display. Yet they’re also both very good at what they do, and are now sharing Black Friday discount honours.

                              <span>Black Friday is usually heaving with discounts on NVMe SSDs, and today’s is no exception. Rather than do the usual routine of just suggesting the WD Black SN850X again, however, there’s no better SSD-for-yer-money deal right now than the Crucial T500, which is going for an exceptionally low £58 right now for the 1TB capacity – down from £120. The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.

                              <span>Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

These days, of course, Black Friday sort of just starts whenever retailers feel like it, which is why we’ve already seen the kind of Steam Deck microSD deals that I’d have normally spent this morning writing up. Instead, here’s an alternate for the more eager screwdriverists among you: up to 50% off the Crucial P310, currently our top pick of the recent breed of Steam Deck replacement SSDs.

                              <span>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in Trombone Champ on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it&#x27;s the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It&#x27;s small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that&#x27;s out now.

It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone&#x27;s flashlight to look for my dog&#x27;s poos in the long grass. Yet it&#x27;s not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale. 

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don&#x27;t anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic&#x27;s advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

It sounds lovely, is comfortable enough to wear for hours, and has such a long battery life that we should probably just consider it witchcraft by now. Also, it’s just had its price cut for Black Friday week, dropping to a very agreeable £110 in the UK and $126.

According to a report, it&#x27;s now a class action suit that could benefit any developers or publishers who have sold a game over the Steam store on or after 28th January 2017.

He sounds annoyed. The field hospital is gone, probably blown to pieces. Troops keep wandering north and disappearing from view, only to come flying back as airborne cadavers moments later. The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision. If the Colonial forces want to win the persistent online war of Foxhole, suggests the sergeant with his many irritated noises, then someone needs to piece these dying fools together. As the only medic in a 500 metre radius, that means me.

                              <span>The genre of &#x27;Action RPG&#x27; is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are &#x27;ARPGs&#x27;. Which stands for &#x27;Action RPG&#x27;. But Zelda games are &#x27;Action RPGs&#x27;, which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to &#x27;ARPG&#x27;. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo &#x27;Diablo-likes&#x27;. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is &quot;like the game I make, but a bit crap&quot;.

                              <span>Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here&#x27;s the gist of it: I&#x27;ve had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I&#x27;m forced to build a hut and so on. I&#x27;m sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it&#x27;s something I tire of within seconds.
And so it&#x27;s with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There&#x27;s a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can&#x27;t do it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I &amp; II remasters. It&#x27;s crisp and readable, sure, but I&#x27;m never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I&#x27;d say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don&#x27;t pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta&#x27;s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I&#x27;m no art scholar, and there&#x27;s undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don&#x27;t exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard&#x27;s Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

                              <span>The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it&#x27;s sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

                              <span>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesn’t get you very far, at least you put in an honest day’s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that don’t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing Diablo 4 all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.
Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?

                              <span>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 7 would be their final handover to players of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian&#x27;s two currently untitled new game projects. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be &quot;diminished&quot;, there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you&#x27;ll get with the just-announced Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

                              <span>Dramacool emerged in the early 2010s, catering to pirates with a love for Asian dramas. The operation eventually drew an audience of millions but, in true drama fashion, announced its own demise this week. The site&#x27;s operators cite &#x27;copyright&#x27; as the reason and recent domain name troubles and pressure from Hollywood studios likely played a role.

I&#x27;m scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it&#x27;s no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.

The games that slipped are Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Slipways was the best grand strategy game I&#x27;d played in years, because it tossed out all the genre&#x27;s micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour&#x27;s play. That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It&#x27;s currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where &quot;all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible.&quot; Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

                              <span>Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One&#x27;s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae&#x27;s Interstellar.

Now there&#x27;s a demo, and it&#x27;s substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three &quot;ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards.&quot;

                              <span>I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we&#x27;re all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their &quot;ring of fire&quot;, I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

                              <span>System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s often claimed by liars and fools that our website&#x27;s title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or &quot;rock paper scissors&quot;, as it&#x27;s known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; is a folksy regional variation on this, with a &quot;shotgun&quot; instead of the &quot;scissors&quot;. But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website&#x27;s title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

                              <span>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, closed doors without a game to their name. Now, sadly, it&#x27;s the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have &quot;paused operations&quot; after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.

                              <span>In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making &quot;gaming&quot; earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers &#x27;round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 just got a small update, mostly to fix a long-running music bug. But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems the recent 20th anniversary update for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

                              <span>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at r/twosentencehorror will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here&#x27;s a creepy good &#x27;un: &quot;&#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. &#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,&#x27; it parroted back from the next room.&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. &quot;It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings,&quot; she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

                              <span>Whereas some bits of games kit are in and out of the sales like they keep forgetting their keys there, The PlayStation 5 DualSense controller is one of those peripherals that just seems to hover around its £60 / $75 list price indefinitely. Which is a shame, as it’s a very, very good gamepad, including for PC playage. Consider these Black Friday week deals, then, as a rare opportunity to secure yourself said good gamepad without acquiescing to Sony’s stubbornness: it’s down to £40 in the UK and $54 in the US.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re playing a &quot;PS1-style&quot; game these days, odds are it&#x27;s a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io&#x27;s Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside &quot;existential grey&quot; is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It&#x27;s a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

                              <span>Recently, PC games have been gorging themselves silly on our storage space. 160GB for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2? 190GB for God of War Ragnarok? If these games were people they’d stand waiting at the Pizza Hut buffet and nab ten of the twelve slices of Pepperoni Feast as soon as they’re slid under the heatlamps. What to do? For our part, there’s little we can do except upgrade capacity, and there are few better ways to do that on a budget than with the WD Blue SN580. It&#x27;s a cheap yet fast PCIe 4.0 SSD, which the Black Friday sales have knocked down to £47 / $55 for 1TB.

Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we&#x27;re talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those comparison pages for stars and planets - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game&#x27;s armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. &quot;Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers,&quot; I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

                              <span>Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I&#x27;d rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year&#x27;s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. &quot;For who is madder?!&quot; I shout, in a normal and cool manner. &quot;The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!&quot;
And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?

                              <span>A studio led by former Mass Effect director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio&#x27;s closure on LinkedIn yesterday, saying that a &quot;shortfall of funding&quot; was responsible for the decision. They had been making a &quot;multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe&quot;, according to the studio&#x27;s website.

That&#x27;s mostly the case in the United States and Europe but the global piracy landscape today is significantly bigger. According to broadcaster beIN, previously shuttered streaming sites are quickly getting back in the game.

Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you&#x27;re talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn&#x27;t really matter, because you don&#x27;t have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

                              <span>The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game&#x27;s janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed &quot;A-life&quot; by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to &quot;emergent&quot; moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It&#x27;s just broken.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s &quot;in the grim darkness of the far future…&quot; tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

                              <span>Microsoft have &quot;applied a compatibility hold&quot; to – i.e., blocked the installation of – a new Windows 11 update that’s causing havoc with certain Ubisoft games. Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are among the weirdly publisher-specific victims of Windows 11 version 24H2, which by Microsoft’s admission (well spotted, Bleeping Computer) is causing crashes and crap performance in the affected games. Even after, in Outlaws’ case, Ubisoft responded to the complaints with their own patch.

The announcement post is mostly image-based, in keeping with the classic saying that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as the words in question are mostly synonyms for &#x27;hut&#x27;, &#x27;mud&#x27;, &#x27;tree&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27;&quot;. Fortunately, Styczeń threw in a few captions to light the way.

Literally, that’s what the streets are saying. “It’s good! A bit shonky, though!” opined my postman this morning, enunciating each syllable by yanking the package further from my grasp. “Don’t worry!” I said. “A patch for the FPS is coming next week”. “That’s cheered me right up, that has! Thank god for games journalists!” he replied. Then the whole street started cheering and bringing me various baked goods. It was a delicious time, and here’s the notes from the delicious patch:

Its compound eyes contract or dim or vanish entirely. Its limbs lengthen, forming contrails from the Arctic to Antarctica (what, did you think those were from planes? Haha. Hahahaha.) Accordingly, news writing becomes a kind of lullaby. Softly now - which promising new PC games are out this week?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

                              <span>That there are more than 100 entire PC games is a revelation as shocking as it is disturbing, but despite recently spending days translating Horace’s sonorous yawps into the list that eventually became our RPS 100, a chill silence recently befell the treehouse when we realised that some of our personal favourites had somehow been excluded. Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo&#x27;s Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard&#x27;s Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element&#x27;s, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

                              <span>The mutant enemies in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it&#x27;s a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it&#x27;s already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

                              <span>Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you&#x27;re slinging is a &quot;solar-powered&quot; pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai&#x27;s debut didn&#x27;t result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp&#x27;s coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

Expensive books and limited access to academic material play a key role among those surveyed. That includes a group of Chinese postgraduate students who believe that shadow libraries help to overcome (academic) poverty.

                              <span>A team of hackers from Brazil have taken first place in a hackathon organized by the country&#x27;s telecoms regulator. The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved &#x27;pirate&#x27; set-top devices from functioning in people&#x27;s homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, &quot;there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,&quot; the hacker predicted.

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)</span>

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.
