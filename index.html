On top of that, if you’re looking to befriend the Ravens in the Forgotten Lands, you’re going to need some 5-star meals to feed them. These are their favorite food, and your key to unlocking Raven companions. 


With that said, not all 5-star meals can be cooked at any given time. Some are locked within quests and cannot be prepared again after the quest itself is done, while others are seasonal and can only be cooked within events. In this guide, I’m going to focus on meals which can be cooked at any time, as long as you have the in…</span>

It&#x27;s relatively easy to find weapons in The Zone, but not all of them are built equal. Some, like the Reimann SMG, are rare guns, and you&#x27;ll want to upgrade them to keep using them for a long time. Thankfully, there&#x27;s a really systematic way to upgrade them once you know where to look for them.

We checked for more codes.




In SU, playing on private servers is the only way to play certain game modes and fully customize your experience. However, they aren&#x27;t cheap, and instead of creating one, you can join a server that already exists. To do that, you&#x27;ll need the Shonen Unleashed private server codes we listed right below.

Keep in mind that whoever enters a private server in case it&#x27;s empty gets to be the admin of it until the owner of the PS enters it.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has some impressive QoL features, one of them being the presence of a fast travel system, which will help you save time and energy.


The Exclusion Zone is pretty massive, and you&#x27;ll have a fair idea if you&#x27;ve played the previous Stalker titles. Reaching a spot for the first time is one thing, but having to do the same stuff repeatedly becomes boring and wastes time. This can be prevented entirely with the help of NPCs to quickly travel between different locations.


Stalker 2 fast travel explained


When you reach a settlement like Rostok for the first time, you&#x27;ll find several NPCs over there. Some of these NPCs are useful for handing out different quests. Others are people of interest - individuals who will help you access the different features. You need to find someone called the Guide.


If you can&#x27;t locate this person manually, always feel free to use the map. The marker for the Guide appears in white and looks like a star. Once you interact with the Guide, you can get to pick other locations. There&#x27;s a catch - a location is only going to be active if you have met the Guide in that spot.


Additionally, you&#x27;ll have to spend coupons to fast travel, so it&#x27;s not a free thing in Stalker 2. Hence, plan your travel and quest completion accordingly, which will reduce your need for fast travel.

Are there any restrictions to fast travel in Stalker 2


Well, you can&#x27;t fast travel if you don&#x27;t have enough resources in the first place. But that&#x27;s not the only restriction you&#x27;ve to worry about. In Stalker 2, things happen in the background, and some of the locations are attacked. In such cases, you won&#x27;t be able to access the NPCs, and this means that fast travel will be temporarily off.


There might also be certain missions that will force you not to use the fast travel feature at times. Excluding such occasions, you should be able to quickly travel between two spots without any problem.

Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP didn&#x27;t arrive in the best state when it was released on the Switch and multiple other platforms in September. Fortunately, Dragami Games has been slowly improving Juliet&#x27;s zombie-hunting adventure.
With this in mind, the company&#x27;s CEO Yoshima Yasuda has now revealed the team has &quot;finally&quot; completed work on improving the frame rate in the Nintendo iteration. According to a translation, the team &quot;picked out 45 scenes&quot; where the frame rate had extreme drops and worked on reducing &quot;processing load and decentralizing loading processes&quot;.

                              <span>Při vydání Windows 10 před devíti lety se hodně řešila důvěrnost dat. Zasílání osobních dat na servery Microsoftu a sledování uživatelů bylo ve světě Windows novinkou. Aeronet tenkrát publikoval hodně probíraný článek tvrdící, že Windows 10 jsou &quot;ve svém principu pouhý terminál na sběr informací o uživateli, jeho prstech, očích a hlasu&quot;. Svět IT se od té doby hodně změnil. Spousta firemních počítačů je dnes s Windows 365 přímo v cloudu. Uživatelé ale pořád mají &quot;osobní počítače&quot;. Microsoft by to rád změnil. Představil zařízení Windows 365 Link, což je v reálu &quot;pouhý terminál&quot; bez operačního systému, který se umí jenom připojit k Windows 365. Dostupný bude v dubnu 2025 za 349 dolarů.</span>

                              <span>Valve have unveiled a new policy about season passes on Steam, which aims to ensure that developers release all the individual DLC involved on time and share adequate details about each DLC pack in advance. It specifies that developers can delay release of a season pass DLC just once, and by no longer than three months. In the event that a developer postpones DLC release by longer than three months, Valve may take such corrective actions as removing the season pass from sale or refunding players.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking forward to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 since it was announced, but I might wait a while longer before trying to play it. It launched yesterday and currently sits at &quot;overwhelmingly negative&quot; Steam reviews due to long loading times caused by server issues.

                              <span>Gang Beasts is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy&#x27;s head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

                              <span>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn&#x27;t of me and my pal. No, it wasn&#x27;t of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn&#x27;t seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume together in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there&#x27;s a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It&#x27;s nice!

Buggier than Kafka&#x27;s Metamorphosis. In our S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review, wasteland wanderer James called it &quot;easily the most borked FPS I&#x27;ve played in years&quot;, detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly.

Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you&#x27;ll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you&#x27;re a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.
Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading &quot;DANGER: BUGS&quot;. In Ukrainian, obviously.

First came Longdue, a conspicuously corporate operator who are making an untitled “psychogeographic RPG”. Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

                              <span>In 2015 a flight by Germanwings carrying 144 passengers and six crew crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You&#x27;re piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: &quot;I hope this hurts.&quot;

                              <span>Workers at Reflector Entertainment, the Montreal studio that recently released third-person action adventure Unknown 9: Awakening, have been hit by layoffs, according to a number of employees who made the cuts public on social media. The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn&#x27;t known, as Reflector haven&#x27;t made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

However, some, like the Flour Mill, are hidden behind specific prerequisites. So, if you&#x27;re eager to unlock the Flour Mill blueprint, here&#x27;s the path to your next farming triumph.


How to unlock Flour Mill blueprint in Luma Island


The Flour Mill blueprint unlocks from the Cook Profession. You can access this career during the game&#x27;s beginning stages, where you can purchase a Profession Permit for free. But, if you have already gotten ahold of a different job, you can still buy another permit for 500 gold the second time. Afterward, it&#x27;ll cost you 10,000 gold for any additional careers, and there&#x27;s no limit on how many you buy.

But have no fear, for I&#x27;ve personally scoured Nalcott to find all of the Deviations and even made notes. Here are all the Deviations in Once Human and where to find them.

There will be plenty of hours for you to sink into the game if you&#x27;re concentrating on the main quest alone. There are dedicated side missions available as well, which will help you unlock more rewards and get a grasp of the overall lore of the latest Stalker adventure.


All main missions in Stalker 2


It&#x27;s very easy to understand which missions are part of the main storyline. They will be marked as orange exclamation points on the map, and it goes without saying that you&#x27;ll want to complete them eventually (unless you don&#x27;t want to finish Stalker 2).

This specific SMG is part of the side quest Seek and You Shall Find, and it can be found pretty early in Zalissya. If you start following the quest, you&#x27;ll be able to come across stashes hidden by journalists, which will help you get some amazing rewards. The Reimann SMG is one of them, but you can get more rewards by completing the quest.


How to get the Reimann SMG in Stalker 2


Once you have activated the quest, you&#x27;ll have to travel to Rostok. To the north of the two sits an unmarked location where you can find the stashes you&#x27;re looking for.

Here&#x27;s a set of solutions you can use to complete both challenges for cheap. 


Angelina Showdown SBC


Task 1 - Top Form



Any 10  82-rated items


Any 80-rated TOTW item



Task 2 - Brazil



Any 9 83-rated items

Any 82-rated TOTW item



Both items are expensive in their existing ratings and overall. However, one of them will receive a +2 upgrade, which will make them a bargain at the current completion price. My bet will be on Angelina, but the last two Showdowns have ended in ties, which means they will end up with a +1 upgrade each.

Supervive Tier List for all Hunters


With 16 Hunters at launch, it can be a bit overwhelming to decide which Hunters to focus on unlocking in the Supervive Open Beta. All Hunters have their own strengths and weaknesses, and if you take the time to learn their toolkit, you can really extract value out of most of these hunters to push them into the S Tier.

                              <span>The Track Stars Challenge 3 SBC should be high on your priority list in EA FC 25, as it includes a really valuable reward. 


Usually, fodder challenges are easy to complete, and you can finish most of them for free. While the rewards aren&#x27;t always great, it&#x27;s not the case. Completing the challenge will reward you with a Rare Players Pack, which usually costs 50,000 coins. Let&#x27;s look at how you can complete the latest fodder challenge.

                              <span>Flint is a useful resource in Towers of Aghasba as it is needed to make all sorts of important crafts in the game. Here&#x27;s where you can find it in abundance.


How to find Flint in Towers of Aghasba


At the start of the game, Flint is an unobtainable resource because you need to craft yourself a Pickaxe to start harvesting it. A bit into the main story, you&#x27;ll be given the recipe to craft a Stone Pickaxe via the Craft menu. This menu can be accessed and used from anywhere in the world.


To craft a Stone Pickaxe, you&#x27;ll need Stone, Stick, and Fiber in specific amounts:


Screenshot by Destructoid



2 x Stick - Picked up off the ground.


3 x Stone - Picked up off the ground.


2 x Fiber - Harvested from wild bushes on the ground



Once you have your Stone Pickaxe made, you now can gather Flint. Flint is harvested from Boulders found scattered around the wilderness.

The amount you obtain depends on the quality of the Pickaxe you use. With the Stone Pickaxe, you&#x27;ll only obtain about one or two per boulder, but there are always plenty of them scattered around.


What is Flint used for in Towers of Aghasba


Screenshot by Destructoid


Flint is used to create several useful items, and you&#x27;ll need a lot of it throughout your time in Towers of Aghasba. Early on, you&#x27;ll use it to craft early-game weapons such as Spears and Arrows. You&#x27;ll also use it to create basic tools/structures like the Construction Table and Standard Mining Hut. Flint, as a material, may become less valuable as your technology advances, but it is still a highly useful resource worth stockpiling.

Whereas regular Requests are for one-off items, such as forageables or crafted items, the newly added Crown Requests are much more labor intensive. They come directly from the King of the mysterious Capital and involve shipping items out of town. Effectively, Crown Requests turn you into a one-man export business.

Crown Requests will become available when you reach Town Rank 50, so you’ve got a bit of work ahead of you if you’re just starting out on your Mistrian adventure. …</span>

                              <span>Sebastian is a fan-favorite eligible bachelor in Stardew Valley. While he may seem aloof initially, it’s easy to see why this “fixer-upper” catches the eye of so many players. If you hope to grow closer to Pelican Town’s resident emo, you’ll need to learn his habits. 


The best way to build up your friendship and eventual romantic connection with any villager, Sebastian included, is to learn their favorite gifts and throw them in their general direction whenever the chance arises. However, it can be hard to do this when a villager’s movements appear completely unpredictable. 


Thankfully, each villager has a set schedule, so you can track their movements throughout the year. If you want to buy Sebastian’s love with daily gifts, here’s how you can find him at any time.

ConcernedApe, the creator and composer of Stardew Valley and SOHO Live are collaborating again for a tour around 18 countries throughout North America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The press release says Symphony of Seasons &quot;brings back the enigmatic melodies of the valley bigger and better than ever before.&quot;

There will be a 35-piece orchestra playing music from Pelican Town, Ginger Island, and Calico Desert that fans would likely enjoy. The tour begins on August 30, 2025 in Seattle, which is ConcernedApe (Eric Barone)&#x27;s hometown and ends in Hawaii on March 21, 2026…</span>

                              <span>The Black Friday gaming deals have already started to roll out ahead of the festive season, and you can make the most of it by picking up at least a few Ubisoft titles to make the most out of your potential savings.


The French gaming giants currently have a website-wide sale, and there are huge discounts across different games. From recent launches to older titles, there&#x27;s a wide array of choices for you to pick. Whether it&#x27;s for your collection or to gift to a loved one, the current Black Friday gaming deals are too good to miss.


Best Ubisoft Black Friday Gaming deals


Almost every available game on the website is currently having a discount, and here are some of my top picks. These picks aren&#x27;t ranked in any order, and you can pick the one you like.



Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora ($28 instead of $69.99) - A pretty great deal considering the age of the game. It isn&#x27;t an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but the discount makes it worth your time and energy (and wallet).


Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage ($20 instead of $49.99) - My favorite Assassin&#x27;s title in the last ten years, and the discount makes it an even better pick.


The Crew Motorfest Deluxe Edition ($24 instead of $79.99) is an underrated racing gem, and the Deluxe edition includes some unique extras.


Riders Republic ($5 instead of $39.99) - A massive discount as part of Black Friday gaming deals on one of the most fun extreme sports simulators on the market.


Anno 1800 ($10 instead of $59.99) - One of the very best town-builders available at a deep discount.



You can further increase your Black Friday gaming deal savings with the loyalty units program if you have previously purchased titles from Ubisoft.

All Races in Deepwoken Listed


The most common races you’ll roll are Etrean, Celtor, Adret, or Canor. The rarest are Capra, Ganymede, and Tiran. Note that roll chances increase for all races once you get your first one since you cannot get the same race again. Here’s each race listed.


Etrean



The base chance to roll an Etrean is 17.8%.


Their stat bonuses are +3 Intelligence and +2 Agility.


The duration of Status Effects, good or bad, is reduced by 15%.


Take less damage in acid rain.

                              <span>The latest entry in the Shiren the Wanderer series made its way to Nintendo Switch in the west back in February. Now it has its eyes on a PC release, with Spike Chunsoft lining up a Steam launch for this winter.


When Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island first debuted on Switch, it brought some updated features along with it. In addition to some quality of life updates to exploration, the roguelike made it even easier to stream with an enhanced Live Display Mode.


All of the free feature updates will be available on the Steam version when it launches. Spike Chunsoft also plans to bring the Plus Pack — paid DLC that introduces 10 new dungeons and more — to Steam.

If the music of Shiren the Wanderer has you tapping your toes through each dungeon, the digital soundtrack is also coming to Steam soon. Spread across three discs, the soundtrack includes a whopping 109 tracks that span 330 minutes of jam time. The Serpentcoil Island soundtrack will also be available on iTunes, YouTube Music, and other platforms through noisycroak Records. 


As for the aforementioned free update features, they include more dungeons and playable characters. You&#x27;ll be able to tackle the six new dungeons and the playable Kokatsu Shiren and Tatsumi Shiren from the start. If you&#x27;re a fan of roguelikes, there&#x27;s a lot to chew on in what serves as a pretty solid entry into the wider Shiren series.

                              <span>In the rabid world of Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, your guns/weapons will also erode over time if you don&#x27;t take good care of them.


While there are over 30 weapons present inside the game, you&#x27;ll want to repair your guns to preserve them. To do so, you&#x27;ll want to find Technicians who are present inside the Zone. Interacting with them will help you to repair the damage your weapons might have taken on your adventures.


How to find a Technician in Stalker 2


You will be able to find a Technician in settlements. The earliest place you&#x27;ll be able to find one is in Zalissya. Once you&#x27;ve survived the first set of monstrosities in the Zone, you will meet someone named Lens. He will be located in the building next to Warlock&#x27;s Bar, and he will repair your weapon&#x27;s durability in exchange for money.


Interact with Lens to open the Technician menu and pick a weapon that has broken. You&#x27;ll be able to repair the gun if you have the required resources.

Should you repair weapons in Stalker 2


I personally believe that it&#x27;s better to let your weapons go unrepaired when you&#x27;re just getting started. Except for the Skif&#x27;s Pistol, all weapons cost money to repair. Once you&#x27;ve completed the first upgrade, Skif&#x27;s Pistol will also cost money to repair.


Repairing will have made sense, but you can also find new weapons in the world. Just switching them will be a far more convenient option and save your resources in the process. However, feel free to repair one if it becomes your favorite.

                              <span>The Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River world has always been black and white as it&#x27;s inspired by the first Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie. However, the world received a Technicolor mod on Saturday that gives it a colorful tone. 


Created by danimalforlife on Nexusmods, all of the character models and the world&#x27;s environments are in color. Sora wears his signature red outfit from the first game, while Donald and Goofy are in their classic blue and green get-ups. As the trailer that danimalforlife has showcased demonstrates, it&#x27;s quite a vast difference from the original black and white look. 


&quot;Everything from the textures, to journal history, to pictures, has been given color,&quot; explains the modder in the Nexusmods listing. 




This mod is only available to PC players. You&#x27;ll need to use KHPCPatchManager and OpenKH to turn on this Technicolor style in Timeless River. Thankfully, Nexusmods claims that the files are clean, as the virus scan claims they are &quot;safe to use.&quot; Nevertheless, this Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River mod is impressive for those who love the beloved Disney series.


Recently, Steamboat Willie has been claimed as fair use. This means that anyone can use the assets of the cartoon for their project. However, it may get tricky as you have to specifically use this version of Mickey and not the modern interpretation. 


Some games have taken the old-school animation art style and made them their own. Cuphead successfully grabbed the attention of many with its difficult gameplay and eye-popping art style that looks ripped from the early 20th century. Mouse: P.I. For Hire is also going old-school with black and white graphics with a first-person shooter. It&#x27;s inspired by the hand-drawn rubber hose animation and jazz soundtracks of the era. It releases sometime in 2025.

                              <span>Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl will be returning with a pretty robust set of factions found in the Zone of Alienation, and they will be a core part of the lore. 


While you&#x27;ll be doing your best to survive in the radiated land, these factions will be adding a complicated layer to the backdrop. Most of them have been introduced via dedicated events in the previous games, so we already have a fair idea about who they are and how they operate. 


All factions in Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl


Twelve different factions feature in Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, and there could be a new one being added in post-launch content (we already know that future DLCs are in work).

                              <span>In a shocking and slightly confusing turn of events, Final Fantasy XIV has announced that there is a mobile version of the incredibly popular MMO on the way. It&#x27;s officially licensed by Square Enix, but being developed by Lightspeed Studios. 


I have to admit, FFXIV Mobile wasn’t exactly at the top of my wishlist or expectations for 2024, but this is not an entirely unexpected announcement. Back in August, a leaked document revealed the title on a list of licensed games heading to China. This official announcement is simply confirmation that it will also be headed to the west at some point. 




According to the FFXIV Mobile website (which I’d recommend viewing only on mobile devices, as it doesn’t seem to work properly on any desktop browser), the concept of FFXIV Mobile is to relive A R…</span>

But unlike the Golden Anvil, which can appear once you level up a set weapon + item combination to the maximum, getting the hammer will demand much more legwork. So that you can take your idol&#x27;s potential to the sky, here&#x27;s how to get and use the Golden Hammer in HoloCure - Save the Fans.


How to get and use the Golden Hammer in HoloCure Save the Fans


You can get the Golden Hammer in HoloCure by reaching level 50 (or any level above) while having at least one of the collab + maxed-out item combinations needed to make a Super Callab (such as the Dragon Fire + the Gorilla&#x27;s Paw). Like most items, however, the Hammer won&#x27;t be given to you direct…</span>

We&#x27;ll start with the free stuff. The Gauntlet Update brings the game up to ver 1.7, and the biggest addition, unsurprisingly, is a new gauntlet-style game mode. Hopping aboard one of Mer-line&#x27;s interdimensional trains after you&#x27;ve completed the main story will give you the chance to partake in &#x27;Magikrab&#x27;s Gauntlet&#x27; — an endless series of carriage-based combat encounters where you can rack up some tasty rewards.

It’s been a stellar year for RPGs on the Switch, with even Mario managing to squeak out three of his own within 12 months and a heavily anticipated remake of a Famicom classic hitting shelves this month with Dragon Quest III Remake.

In the gaming space, Kadokawa owns Spike Chunsoft, Acquire, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and FromNetworks, while also owning a majority stake in FromSoftware alongside Tencent and Sony. We imagine that FromSoftware is proving particularly attractive for Sony, since the studio is responsible for the likes of Elden Ring, Bloodborne, Dark Souls, and the Armored Core franchise.

One of the most significant catalysts for fan anticipation came via Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, released for the Wii in 2007.

For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 &quot;Turin&quot; processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.</span>

                              <span>During the coming weeks, the 15,000th piracy-linked resource will likely find itself blocked by Brazilian ISPs in response to yet another court order. Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet&#x27;s core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let&#x27;s take a closer look at how things play out.

                              <span>A new survey from Norway reveals that 50% of young people under 30 believe that pirating content is an acceptable way to save money.  The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

After missing key data last week, GfK has finally provided an updated look at the UK charts so we can get an idea of where all the newbies have landed.
For Nintendo&#x27;s latest, that&#x27;s a little way down. The latest look informs us that Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership got off to a good start last week (not that we saw it) and arrived in third, but the same can&#x27;t be said for its second appearance as the Bro-led RPG has wound up in 12th this week.

                              <span>Remedy&#x27;s Control 2 will be an &quot;action RPG&quot;, the developers have announced, and while I have already caved and written it up, I&#x27;m not sure this is really news. Wasn&#x27;t the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn&#x27;t every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn&#x27;t have RPG-style elements. No wait, don&#x27;t actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

                              <span>My time with Threshold has been fraught with pain. Five times. Five times I had to restart this psychological horror game because of some game-breaking bug. And yet, I persevered, booting it back up and returning to my government-mandated shift atop a quiet mountain.
Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it&#x27;s time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I&#x27;m back. It&#x27;s worth it.

These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they&#x27;ve shown the campaign a little love as well.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their stinking rat hordes - it builds upon the 2020 game by &quot;[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming&quot;, in the words of the launch announcement release.
We&#x27;ve got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of &quot;machine learning&quot; technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it&#x27;ll devour as you play.

                              <span>A long while ago I wrote about Vampire Survivors-likes needing to stop overwhelming you with visual clutter. I&#x27;ve since played a few games of a similar ilk that don&#x27;t hammer you with a chaos that&#x27;s impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is Bloodshed, an old school FPS take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase &quot;just one more run&quot;.

                              <span>I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I&#x27;ve never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: &quot;ah, that was good.&quot;
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun &#x27;em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

                              <span>Good morning, how about a nice big bowl of your favourite breakfast cereal: Corporate Consolidation? Sony are in talks to buy Kadokawa, the parent company of Elden Ring developer From Software. Sony is eyeing up the company as a hefty snack because they want the various manga and anime owned by Kadokawa, according to a report by Reuters. But also because they want all the tasty games owned by them too, such as the Danganronpa series, the Octopath Traveler games, and the biggest corn flake of them all, the Dark Souls series.

Hra změnila navždy svět počítačových her a okamžitě uchvátila miliony hráčů po celém světě. Co ji ale dělá tak výjimečnou, je její schopnost spojit lidi napříč kontinenty, nabídnout jim obrovské a živé světy k prozkoumání a hluboký příběh, který se neustále vyvíjí. Každé rozšíření přidávalo nové prvky a příběhové linky, které hráče stále motivovaly k návratu.</span>

Bezpečnostní audit [PDF] odhalil celkem 27 zranitelností a problémů v různých subsystémech FreeBSD. Sedm problémů nebylo možné zneužít a výsledkem je spíše zlepšení robustnosti nebo kvality kódu než o bezprostřední bezpečnostní problémy.</span>

                              <span>Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

                              <span>Spanish police have shut down Cristal Azul, a popular Kodi add-on with an estimated 78,000 users. As sports rightsholders claim the fraudulent access cost them €42 million, in piracy circles the shutdown is being linked to a change of policy at Telegram. A direct warning that personal details could be handed over by Telegram coincides with some piracy groups abandoning the platform.

                              <span>It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It&#x27;s like the &quot;glass half empty&quot; mindset, but the bartender hasn&#x27;t even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you&#x27;ve wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the &quot;bar&quot;, gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they&#x27;re making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don&#x27;t want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015&#x27;s Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. &quot;A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please,&quot; I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman&#x27;s travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

I hope one day to level up from &quot;bumbling, tumbling and blundering&quot; to &quot;running and jumping&quot;. Perhaps I&#x27;ll even get as far as &quot;speedrunning&quot;. But in the likely event that I plateau at &quot;blundering&quot;, it&#x27;s a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to work out if I&#x27;m keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes&#x27; hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer&#x27;s boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn&#x27;t like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It&#x27;s also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn&#x27;t see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there&#x27;s a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe&#x27;s pre-alpha &quot;prelude&quot;: I&#x27;m keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren&#x27;t encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of &quot;hateful or extremist&quot; language and images hosted on Steam&#x27;s community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it&#x27;s framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně &quot;zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!&quot; (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.

                              <span>A new trend has emerged on YouTube where &#x27;scammy&#x27; channels facing a ban for copyright infringement appear to evade penalties through the use of sexually explicit content.

As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it&#x27;s an intentional move that&#x27;ll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

                              <span>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been &#x27;out&#x27; of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as &quot;a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles&quot;. It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

                              <span>2024 has been a pretty rough year for Nintendo-loving emulator fans. At this point it&#x27;s clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can&#x27;t have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo&#x27;s disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

                              <span>Sorry We&#x27;re Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn&#x27;t often into the &#x27;lore&#x27; behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character&#x27;s own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I&#x27;d enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it&#x27;s just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say &quot;lol, it me&quot; with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter &quot;ugh, it me&quot; and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

                              <span>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

                              <span>The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap &quot;should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.&quot; But do you?

                              <span>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter Unreal to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They&#x27;ve also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

                              <span>Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a &#x27;Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest&#x27;, which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

In addition to the usual charges relating to the distribution of unlicensed streams, initial reports suggest that cybersecurity crimes relating to the functionality of the Magis TV software will also feature among the charges.

                              <span>Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they&#x27;ve turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you&#x27;ll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

                              <span>Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you&#x27;ve made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I&#x27;ve found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

                              <span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&#x27;s premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

                              <span>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

                              <span>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were &quot;born in Chornobyl?&quot; as a play on &quot;were you born in a barn?&quot; whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been &quot;you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?&quot;, because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

                              <span>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as &quot;co-developers&quot; on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

                              <span>Google is facing criticism in Spain and Italy for alleged anti-piracy failures. The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here&#x27;s the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as &quot;grossly negligent&quot; deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google&#x27;s diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

These include OKTOON, which was also pulled offline, and piracy giant NoonooTV, which voluntarily threw in the towel last year.

It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

                              <span>After nearly a year of public beta honing, the Nvidia App – Team Green’s new one-stop shop for desktop GPU management – is out in full. Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

                              <span>My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter&#x27;s job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

                              <span>The developers of hero shooter Overwatch 2 must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a &quot;Classic&quot; mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

As reported by Polygon, that&#x27;s an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of The Crew. They&#x27;re suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the racing game&#x27;s servers, rendering it unplayable.

                              <span>Sin enjoyed the roguelike stylings of Dungeons of Blood and Dream when she played it in early access back in July, calling it a “baffling, bizarre thing that lives on the border of janky, retro, and punk”. As of yesterday, it’s now out for realsies, promising psychedelic dungeon crawling, the stabbing of assorted gribblies, and lots of little details that make you go “ooo, that’s nice. I’m glad they put that in there.”

                              <span>The developers who remade Half-Life as Black Mesa are working on a new roguelite co-op shooter. It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In Rogue Point the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth. Which is where your team of renegade shooterists come in. They don&#x27;t want to win this contest, they just want everyone else to lose.

A successor to the translucent version that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.

                              <span>Several major record labels are asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a rehearing en banc in their piracy lawsuit against Grande Communications. They argue that the court erred in holding that piracy damages should be calculated per album, rather than per song. They argue that this decision, which will lower the $47 million damages award, doesn&#x27;t reflect the way that music is commercialized today.

That may seem like a win, but the finer details reveal a legal framework that favors rightsholders so strongly, online services incurring liability for the actions of users seems inevitable.

I’ve stopped a small community from completing a blood ritual, played the role of matchmaker to a group of lonely hearts that involved organising a date with god, and plastered a statue with paint as part of a revolutionary movement to uplift the power of art. My time with GGG has been a pick n’ mix of colourful escapades, and together with its story of godly woes, striking art style, vacuum-based puzzle-solving, and nightmare-inducing puppet work, I’m now a die-hard LimboLane devotee.

But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel&#x27;s development back in 2004. Rolling Stone interviewed two key designers of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children&#x27;s book about a nice elephant.

It encompasses the full breadth and width of PC gaming stretching back to 1873, but focuses solely on those games that remain great to play today. It&#x27;s updated yearly by our crack team of writers, and the first half of the 2024 edition is live now.

                              <span>Let’s try and get you up to speed on the fascinating oddity that is simulation game Ecosystem, on the off chance that Nate&#x27;s coverage of it hasn&#x27;t stuck with you like an unwelcome brain parasite you’re nonetheless unwilling to get removed for fear of the lingering emptiness it might cause (he once described an eel as “a quaver with erectile dysfunction”). Broadly speaking, this game is Spore’s evolutionary-biology-degree-having cousin. It’s been in early access for about three years now, but with the latest &quot;Crustacean&quot; update, it’s just hit 1.0. Once again, carcinization has come for all things.

Allow yourself a moment to savour the idea. I&#x27;m so thrilled for you! The Maw, sadly, does not understand the concept of &quot;time off&quot;. Its hunger is as constant as the tide, as unrelenting as my retreating hairline. So before I disappear into a beam of sunshine, here&#x27;s this week&#x27;s list of new PC game releases.

I&#x27;m currently reading Tony Tulathimutte’s Rejection. Jia Tolentino wrote about it for the New Yorker. Jia Tolentino also writes very good books. But enough about books, tell me about books! One&#x27;s you&#x27;ve read, preferably, but I will also accept books you&#x27;ve formed opinions on based on their covers, as is good and proper. Book for now!

Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and &quot;games journalist&quot; doesn&#x27;t really cover it. 

One of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru, faces claims of unauthorized public performance and reproduction, contributory infringement and inducement for sharing links to emulators and pirated ROMs, plus violations of the anti-circumvention and circumvention device trafficking components of the DMCA.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics Of War developers Proxy Studios have just released Zephon, a new 4X strategy game set in a manky, post-apocalyptic world. It&#x27;s got hexagonal maps, flesh trees, gangly Evangelion-grade giants, &quot;otherworldly hymns of decay&quot;, nuclear bombs, and a player-led &quot;blend of magic and cyberpunk&quot; that extends from the city architecture to the research component. All of which is my cup of giblets. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

They&#x27;re now adding 2000 players to a Preludes build of the game every week, with each invite email including an additional four invite codes, so you can get your friends involved.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been out for a little while already, what with me giving its multiplayer largely a thumbs up. Still, it&#x27;s an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game&#x27;s first seasonal drop. It&#x27;s a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I&#x27;ll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there&#x27;s some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I&#x27;m mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.

                              <span>&quot;The cool thing about bombs is that you can hide them in anything,&quot; is probably my favourite Oppenheimer quote of all time, and in the case of Ian Hitman, it does raise an important question: with so many everyday objects equal to the rubber duck in its unthreatening aura, yet more inconspicuous, why choose to put an explosive in this one?
The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

                              <span>Palworld developers Pocketpair have finally revealed which patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are suing them about. It looks like they&#x27;re focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you&#x27;ve somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it&#x27;s a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

                              <span>In all honesty, Toads Of The Bayou could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its Steam demo ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

But there are other businessy reasons, of course. Namely, Sega have been trying to trim down their European studios for the past year, and Amplitude is just the latest bunch of devs affected by that.

Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.

                              <span>Could tower defence be the ultimate &quot;it&#x27;s Friday and I am here in body only&quot; genre? I haven&#x27;t really thought about it before, but Rift Riff&#x27;s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it&#x27;s a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There&#x27;s a demo, if you fancy it.

                              <span>Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades&#x27; worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

                              <span>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it&#x27;s controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I&#x27;ll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

                              <span>Life simulation game Inzoi will launch on PC via Steam early access on 28th March 2025, publishers Krafton have announced. Billed as a potential Sims 4 usurper, and equipped with syrupy Unreal Engine 5 visuals, it was originally slated for launch this year.

                              <span>Back in the mists of 2021, No Man&#x27;s Sky revealed its very own Normandy SR1 space frigate. &quot;The Normandy in No Man&#x27;s Sky?&quot; you cry. &quot;Why, that&#x27;s a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?&quot; 1) My name&#x27;s not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
&quot;Blast, if only I&#x27;d noticed this at the time and acquired one,&quot; you mourn. &quot;Ah, so many years I have wasted.&quot; Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man&#x27;s Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you&#x27;ll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021&#x27;s Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and free games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find VED: Purification, a free prologue demo to RPG VED, here.

                              <span>When multiplayer fishing game Webfishing came out last month, it offered a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say &quot;Trans&quot; or &quot;Bi&quot;. All this led one player to complain there was no &quot;Straight&quot; title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

                              <span>A few months ago, the rumour took root that GTA 6&#x27;s release date would slip back from 2025 to 2026. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were &quot;worried&quot; about the new open world game&#x27;s progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar&#x27;s decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are &quot;highly confident in the timing&quot;, though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

                              <span>When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

                              <span>Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

                              <span>There must be hundreds of typewriters in the hall, their collective clacks a tidal wave of soulless automation, rising up to greet agent Kiran Estevez as she enters, pistol and flashlight in hands. Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

                              <span>Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there&#x27;ll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

                              <span>Foxhole is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don&#x27;t play it. It&#x27;s a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like &quot;I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer&quot;, but it is the nature of children to rebel.

The true highlight, though, is yet to come. And that&#x27;s through an entirely different Halo game: The Master Chief Collection. Soon enough, you&#x27;ll be able to play Halo 2&#x27;s lost E3 demo on it, thanks to some lovely modders.

                              <span>Back in the misty reaches of time (March) popular farming sim Stardew Valley got a big update that added more pets to the game (it also let you drink mayonaise but let&#x27;s not get sidetracked). Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. &quot;[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets,&quot; said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: &quot;a strange rash&quot;.

It&#x27;s basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the &quot;lol-games-are-dumb&quot; channel of your friend&#x27;s Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

                              <span>We’re still a week away from Blizzard’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct next Wednesday the 13th of November, but art from an apparent remaster of 1995 real time strategy game Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness has leaked online, via Xibbly user Stiven. It’s a thin one, as far as leaks go, but does show what looks to be cover, logo art, and a Battle.net icon. Thanks for the spot, Percy Coswald Gamer.

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

                              <span>Unrest is a roleplaying game developed by Pyrodactyl Studios set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India. You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.
We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM&#x27;s Global Main Menu.
