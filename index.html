                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

                              <span>We can all breathe a sigh of relief.
Mario&#x27;s nipples are, surprisingly, a subject of great debate. Every year, Nintendo has posted a nice, summery render of our plumber boy at the beach, and this year is no different. But when Mario&#x27;s at the beach, and not at work, he trades in his overalls for swimming trunks — and that means this is the only time that we see him topless.
In 2020, Nintendo decided (for whatever reason) to excise poor Mario&#x27;s nips, presumably out of some Nintendo-esque need to PROTECT THE CHILDREN from the horrors of thinking that Mario is mammalian. The internet, not to be outdone, decided that this was weirder than just letting Mario have nipples in the first place, and so in 2021, Nintendo put them back where they belong.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a long way off though.
Developer Nonohara Works has announced Calme, an isometric adventure game that kind of reminds us of the likes of Ni No Kuni and Octopath Traveler in terms of its art direction.
It&#x27;s heading to the Switch, but you better get comfortable, because the game is in the very early stages of development and allegedly won&#x27;t be available until some time after 2024.

We admit it, we&#x27;re suckers for a really nice pre-order bonus. Especially when it comes to figurines. And with Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet coming out this November, we&#x27;re eager to see just what kind of bonuses or gifts will be on offer from various retailers.
So far, we only know about a few digital gifts — such as an exclusive backpack and that cute little Pikachu who&#x27;s Terastral form means he gets balloons! — but Nintendo Wire has discovered that French retailer Micromania-Zing is already ahead of the pack with this lovely physical pre-order bonus.

When you&#x27;re going cave diving, what do you need? A notebook? We&#x27;re not sure about that! But the upcoming Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness wants you to bring one with you.
Well, not in real life, but there&#x27;s a key mechanic in the action RPG, and it&#x27;s not really for Abyss diving. It&#x27;s for recording details of the people you meet, the creatures you encounter, and the relics you uncover.

                              <span>It’s a grower.
Strange Horticulture takes on some big challenges. It’s a carefully authored story that wants to be driven by interaction, and it’s a single-scene play space that wants to create immersion in a whole world. It’s such a tricky line to walk between structured gameplay that’s interactive but dry and a carefully managed story that limits interaction. But with Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking pulls it off. It creates deep immersion in a well-rounded world while starting from a simple place. The filling-out of the world as we played came from our own discoveries, and we were drawn powerfully into the emerging intrigue of the plot.
In Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking has created a mystery story set in a bizarro-style English Lake District, where real-life place names nestle amid castles, stone circles and religious cults. The player runs an apothecary dealing in specialist plants with medicinal, mind-altering, magical and even mechanical effects. Each day, a series of customers arrive at your counter in need of horticultural help. By cross-referencing what’s on your plant shelf with what’s in your plant-cyclopaedia, you identify the salves, syrups and embrocations that are needed. There’s a loop of learning and labelling plants to receive more plants and more info pages that immediately sucks you in.

                              <span>Scarlet and Violet reportedly fixes a fan favourite Pokémon.
Pokémon fans have, rather expectedly, been quite divided on the upcoming mainline titles Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. While many are embracing the new open-world nature of the games and the apparent freedom it affords players, others are disappointed that the games seem to be a step back after Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Some fans, however, have noticed a very specific change to one of the creatures showcased in the trailer: Eelektross, the final form of Tynamo introduced in Pokémon Black and White.

Square Enix has been a mainstay in the industry for years, but it looks like the Japanese publisher and developer is struggling, having reported declining financial results for Q1 2023 (besides the huge success of its MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV). And, following the publication of those results, Eurogamer reports that the company is looking to &quot;improve capital efficiency&quot; by selling stakes in its studios.
This comes from an internal conference call held after the results were shared, with MST Financial analyst David Gibson breaking down the discussion on Twitter.

                              <span>Time to purge some demons!
Developer and publisher Inti Creates, known for its work on games such as Mega Man Zero, Azure Striker Gunvolt, and the Castlevania-inspired Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon, has announced that it is working on a brand new 2D action platformer that looks like a beautiful mash up of all three.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge takes the fast paced shooting mechanics of Mega Man and blends it with the close-quarters melee combat seen in classic Castlevania titles. It stars two demon hunters - Shinobu and Maya - who must infiltrate a dangerous castle that now stands in place of their former school. You&#x27;ll be able to switch between the two characters on the fly to utilise their unique skills, or you can team up with a friend for two-player co-op gameplay.

                              <span>It&#x27;s to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the series
Assassin&#x27;s Creed has had its ups and downs, and now you can help alleviate the latter a bit with an official...Assassin&#x27;s Creed whiskey?
Crafted by Tennessee Legend, who partnered with Antheum Studios (who in turn partnered with Ubisoft), it&#x27;s a straight bourbon whiskey that&#x27;s priced at $69 per bottle. It&#x27;s expected to arrive in &quot;early September 2022.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from the manufacturer:
&quot;Leap into history and celebrate 15 years of working in the dark to serve the light. Antheum Studios and Tennessee Legend Distillery present Assassin’s Creed Straight Bourbon Whiskey. Crafted in the hill country of Texas and finished in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, this 4 year old straight bourbon whiskey carries a rich flavor with rye spice, wheat character, and hints of cherry, vanilla and oak. Appealing to spirit connoisseurs and fans alike, this iconic selection is a worthy addition to any bar. Game hard, drink responsibly.&quot;

Assassin&#x27;s Creed whiskey isn&#x27;t the only drink on the menu: an Assassin&#x27;s Creed Black Flag rum and Valhalla vodka are on the horizon too
If you&#x27;re interested, also in September, Antheum studios is going to be launching both a Black Flag Spiced Rum and a Valhalla vodka. I kinda want to try the former?

For the first time in a long time, the greatest fighting game players in the world, (but not me), will descend on Las Vegas for the annual throwdown that is the Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as Evo 2022. Over the next three days, the best of the best, (but not me), will lock horns in some of the greatest fighting games currently on the market.
From Tekken 7 to Street Fighter V, Skullgirls to Granblue Fantasy: Versus, and, the game of the hour, Guilty Gear Strive, we are promised hours of intense fighting action across three days, as each game looks to crown its champion for the current EVO season. In addition, we can expect news, updates, and reveals pertaining to some of the current and upcoming fighters. Who is headed to Street Fighter 6? What…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo condensed their Pokemon Presents stream
Just the other day we got a lengthy Pokemon Presents video that dug deep into Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news: now we have a distillation of that mainline focus while cutting out all the other stuff.  Titled &quot;world overview,&quot; the video was put up separately the day after the presentation, and serves as a six minute rundown of the Scarlet and Violet bits.
As a recap, here is what the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news video entails:
The overview of the &quot;partner legendary&quot; system, which allows you to use the new box legendaries as vehicles (land, sea, and air)
A breakdown of the story, and how you&#x27;re playing the role of a student at either the Naranja (Scarlet) or Uva (Violet) academy
There are &quot;eight gyms, three stories, and no set path&quot; for conquering the gyms and story progression
An intro to some of the cast (Professors Sada and Turo, Director Clavell, Mr. Jacq, your friend Nemona, Arven the upperclassman, Penny the &quot;shy student,&quot; and Grusha the ice type gym leader)
A reminder of some existing old Pokemon, as well as the regional Wooper Paldean form, Fidough, and Cetitan
Footage of the multiplayer function, involving co-op with up to three people and raid battles
The Terastal gimmick, where Pokemon crystalize and can change types
After this presentation, I&#x27;m pretty into Scarlet and Violet, mostly due to the promise of the partner exploration system and multiplayer, in tandem. It sounds like a good time to just connect with someone and roam around the Paldea region.

                              <span>Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares
Tencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.
Citing multiple sources &quot;with direct knowledge of the matter&quot;, Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share&#x27;s current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .
There have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company&#x27;s initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.
Tencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.

                              <span>Announced at BitSummit
Inti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.
Grim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says &quot;swapping characters is key to gameplay,&quot; and in addition to solo play, there&#x27;s also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.
Amazingly, Inti Creates is calling this &quot;the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games,&quot; hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn&#x27;t going to do it, someone else should!
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info
As for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as &quot;TBD,&quot; but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we&#x27;ll get that info.
Just as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I&#x27;m game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians. This is an easy sell.

                              <span>It&#x27;s raw
I hate reality TV, but I love Gordon Ramsey. Perhaps it’s better to say I like the character that Gordon Ramsey plays, as I understand that he’s not actually that caustic in person. He talks to people like I talk to Ninja Gaiden on the NES; nothing but derision.
Recipe for Disaster is definitely feeding off Kitchen Nightmares. During its early access period, it seemed to highlight that you were hiring a bunch of unique personalities and throwing them into a stew. You’re thrust into a series of struggling restaurants with the intent of rescuing them from their terrible owners. The question is: does Recipe for Disaster deliver on this tantalizing concept? The biggest question is: can Recipe for Disaster convince me not to just reinstall Pizza Connection 2?

                              <span>A new GDK update could see some graphical improvements for the Series S
A recent update to Microsoft&#x27;s Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.
In the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.
&quot;Hundreds of megabytes&quot; have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Bb6ZLGwkClM
As Ars Technica details, this hasn&#x27;t been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft&#x27;s current-gen hardware.
More memory for the box
This seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical &quot;oomph&quot; on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft&#x27;s two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.
The relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It&#x27;s especially nice for those who aren&#x27;t necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;94O6o6yOGgA
Hopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn&#x27;t a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.
The GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We&#x27;ll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.

Microsoft has begun testing a new family plan option for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and I&#x27;m hopeful that it rolls out to the rest of the world sooner than later. Xbox Insiders in Colombia and Ireland can add up to four people to their subscription.
&quot;This makes it even easier to play the best Game Pass games with friends and family across console, PC, and cloud by enabling you to add up to four people to your subscription, all with their own unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games, content, and benefits,&quot; said Sr. Technical Program Manager Tyler Mittleider.
There are a few caveats to keep in mind for the test run, as detailed on the Xbox Wire blog.

Brace Yourself Games is adding even more content to Crypt of the Necrodancer, in the form of a DLC update called Synchrony. The new update was revealed today and is available now in Early Access.
Crypt of the Necrodancer: Synchrony is a brand new content pack, adding a wealth of new features to 2015&#x27;s rhythm roguelite classic Crypt of the Necrodancer. It&#x27;s currently only available on PC, though Brace Yourself says it would like to port to other consoles once Synchrony is out of Early Access.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MX9JlggiCHo
So what&#x27;s in the update? Well, a big portion is online multiplayer support. Synchrony adds support for up to eight players, in online co-op and versus modes. That&#x27;s a whole lot of hoppin&#x27; and bouncin&#x27; to the beat.

                              <span>If you’ve been keeping up with what’s happening at Warner Bros., its streaming service HBO Max, and its new partner company by way of a merge, Discovery – collectively, it’s now Warner Bros. Discovery – then you know things have been bleak the past couple of days. 
The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery&#x27;s streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

                              <span>Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it&#x27;s important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: 
Get ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Wisdom from those who have tried opening a restaurant informs you that it isn’t the easiest way to make money. If Recipe for Disaster is any indication, running a successful eatery is a challenging, trial-and-error affair with plenty of stress and frustration, but one that, once mastered, offers excitement and gratification to balance it all out.
In this restaurant-management sim, you manage staff, monitor your business, and work to ensure your lights stay on. Hiring the right employees to develop a balanced team composition and designing a functional and visually appealing restaurant are i…</span>

One of the most fun (and frustrating) ways to play an old favorite is trying to complete a self-imposed challenge that really ratchets up the difficulty. For me, it was beating a run in Hades on 32 heat — for others, it might be completing a Dark Souls run without taking damage or doing a Nuzlocke of a favorite Pokémon game. When you love a game enough to put the hours in that you need to complete a challenge like this, you&#x27;d be surprised at how much you can accomplish — and by how triumphant it feels when you finally beat it. I imagine that streamer Jervalin is riding even higher after winning a $20,000 cash prize for beating a near-impossible challenge in Halo 2.

Who doesn&#x27;t love a good video game sidekick? I&#x27;ve been playing through some of the old Ratchet &amp; Clank games with a friend, and while A Crack in Time is one of the best of the series, my biggest gripe is that we don&#x27;t get enough Ratchet and Clank quality time. Maybe I&#x27;m just too sentimental, but I really love seeing best buddy characters in my games, and Clank makes just about the best sidekick a girl could ask for.
He&#x27;s got it all — an adorable personality, quippy dialogue, useful game mechanics, he never gets in the way, and his gameplay sections break things up and provide some cool puzzle mechanics. Clank is so awesome, he got me thinking about some other great — and not so great — sidekicks in video games.
No one likes a useless sidekick

                              <span>It&#x27;s to establish a new identity, and also a bit easier to say
Koch Media, a games publisher under the grand umbrella of the Embracer Group, is changing up its name. The publisher formerly known as Koch is now Plaion, as the 28-year-old company is rebranding.
Under the moniker of Koch Media, the company operated publishing labels like Deep Silver and Prime Matter. It&#x27;s part of various games and brands, ranging from Homefront and Metro to Saints Row and Dead Island. The company was purchased by Embracer Group (THQ Nordic at the time) in 2018. Now, it will operate under a new name.
In a press release, Plaion says this new name will better represent the company&#x27;s history and the groups it works with.
&quot;Our new name offers us the opportunity to build on our rich history as a publishing partner and our outstanding, constantly growing network of world-class development studios and creative people, to keep delivering premium service to our partners, to highlight our ambition as a global player within the entertainment industry but also to reinvent ourselves,&quot; said Plaion managing director Klemens Kundratitz. &quot;Our vision is to enable and inspire our worldwide teams and partners, unlocking their full potential.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YgjzDJA1o1E
What&#x27;s in a name?
Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz about the name change, Kundratitz also expresses hope that the name change will make more of an international impact.
&quot;Our name for so many years was associated with physical distribution, perhaps with us being more of a central European company–although including the UK because that was among the first three countries where we launched,&quot; Kundratitz told GIbiz. &quot;But we&#x27;re perhaps not seen as a global company. And it&#x27;s sometimes difficult for some people to pronounce.&quot;
For the record, Plaion is easy to pronounce. It&#x27;s just play-on. The company&#x27;s new logo is also stylized around the common triangle used for Play.

                              <span>The cars were weirdly static before this update
Nintendo is revisiting an absurd amount of classic tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the Booster Course Pass, and while most of the attention is fixated on the just-released second wave of DLC, there&#x27;s one small but appreciated change that&#x27;s worth noting. Now, in the final stretch of Coconut Mall, the Shy Guys don&#x27;t just sit there in their cars.
The developers shared a short clip of the new Shy Guy antics.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1555191948956368897
Granted, in the original Mario Kart Wii version of Coconut Mall, the obstacles were deadlier — the cars drove back and forth and were harder to avoid. That isn&#x27;t the case here.
This Coconut Mall fix is more of a middle ground for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players.
The Shy Guys are less static than before (excluding the Time Trial mode, as pictured above), but they aren&#x27;t too annoying, either. Before, they felt lifeless in a kind of jarring way, and people definitely noticed that something felt off near the finish line. So it&#x27;s good to see Nintendo go back and improve things, even if it&#x27;s a small detail in the grand scheme.
After you&#x27;re done playing the Turnip and Propellor Cups in Wave 2 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, maybe circle back for a match on Coconut Mall. I&#x27;m excited to hop online tonight, especially for the all-new track, Sky-High Sundae.
At this point, kind of against all odds, I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten good mileage out of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass.

Hindsight is the game highlighted by Nintendo this week, as we enter a quiet period following a major first-party release in Xenoblade Chronicles 3. We reviewed it! Make sure you read some impressions of this somewhat contentious game.
Outside of that, there isn&#x27;t much! Even the ancillary game list is a bit smaller this week to give Xenoblade a wide berth.

                              <span>Hardly out-of-pocket, in all sense of the term
Mobile gaming, which has continued to grow from strength to strength on a yearly basis, saw its first decline in revenue for some time in the first half of 2022. The slump in overall sales and in-game transactions hit most genres, though many of the most popular titles continue to hold steady.
The new data, published by the industry analysts over at Sensor Tower, shows that only the &quot;Arcade&quot; genre saw any significant growth, with a raise of around 14% year-on-year, which equates to somewhere in the region of $176 million USD. Almost all other genres — from racing games to puzzlers, RPGs to shooters, and even the cash cow of casino games — all saw a hefty decline in sales figures.

Overall, the U.S. mobile gaming market was down by almost 10% over the previous year. This won&#x27;t find the industry on the ropes just yet, however, as it still raked in somewhere in the region of $11.4 billion. Astounding. The decline in mobile gaming revenue has been equated to both the increased cost of living, economical issues, and the softening of COVID-19 restrictions, which has seen more people out and about, rather than sitting at home idly on their phones.
Mobile gaming is just one of a number of industry sectors that have reported a revenue decline in 2022. Publishers such as PlayStation, Activision Blizzard, and Nintendo have all seen either hardware, software, or operating income fall when compared to the same period the previous year. While none of these slumps are big enough to cause any sweats, it is clear that the gaming industry as a whole is entering something of a down period, one very likely to continue as 2022 progresses.

                              <span>It&#x27;ll be all about Title Update 1
A new Monster Hunter Rise stream is coming in hot, as Capcom has announced an August 9 date: all of it will deal with Title Update 1.
So it&#x27;s actually going to be at 7AM PT on August 9, right here on the Monster Hunter Twitch channel. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and game director Yoshitake Suzuki will be stopping by for the express purpose of diving into Title Update 1: a free update for Sunbreak coming this month that will add Lucent Nargacuga, Seething Bazelgeuse, and several other features. Hopefully beyond the big stuff, they&#x27;ll talk about little quality of life features — like this Marionette Spider change.
In recent Monster Hunter news, Capcom reminds folks that there&#x27;s a franchise sale going on right now on Steam, which includes a near-50% discount on Rise. It&#x27;s not a bad time to get into Monster Hunter at the moment, given the proliferation of Rise on a popular console and PC, and the steady release of lots of free updates. By the time you work your way through all of the history of Rise, original free updates included, it should last you a long while before you&#x27;re allowed to rank up to coast to the expansion.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Title Update 1 recap (August):
Seething Bazelgeuse
Lucent Nargacuga (and “several other monsters”)
New locale: Forlorn area
Rare species monsters
Special species monsters

SNK has announced that it is working on a second compendium of titles pulled from the back catalog of the Neo Geo Pocket Color. While the studio has made an official reveal for Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2, it remained shy about delivering any information whatsoever pertaining to the release.
The original Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection launched on PC and Nintendo Switch in March of 2021 and is packed out with 10 hit games for SNK&#x27;s awesome, but ultimately unsuccessful, handheld console. The original release featured hits such as Samurai Shodown! 2, SNK Gals Fighters, Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999, Big Tournament Golf, and The King of Fighters R-2, but did not contain independent re-releases such as SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, or the brilliant Match of the Millennium. (Note: MotM was only excluded from the Steam edition.)
While SNK has not announced platforms, a release date, nor a game listing for the second selection, one would assume it would compile the aforementioned omissions and — if we&#x27;re extremely lucky — the NGPC ports of Bandai Namco&#x27;s Pac-Man and Sega&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog. According to SNK, more details are set to follow soon. In related news, the NGPC version of rarity Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters dropped out of nowhere on Nintendo Switch.
Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 is currently in development at SNK.

                              <span>More terrors lurk in the world of Back 4 Blood
Back 4 Blood is getting its next expansion at the end of this month. Children of the Worm, the second DLC expansion for Back 4 Blood, goes live on August 30, 2022.
The Children of the Worm will have a new story campaign, adding an Act 5 to the action. New enemies threaten to cause a bunch of problems for the Cleaner crew.
But the survivors will have some back-up, too. A new playable Cleaner, &quot;Prophet&quot; Dan, is also joining the action. A previous preacher of the end times, he&#x27;ll probably make for a wacky addition to the roster of playable characters.

The expansion will also include some new weapons, cards, and skins. Anyone who picked up the Back 4 Blood Annual Pass, or the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition, gets Children of the Worm as part of that. Otherwise, Children of the Worm will be available as a standalone purchase.
The ongoing apocalypse
This new entry marks Back 4 Blood&#x27;s second expansion, following after the Tunnels of Terror DLC expansion that went live in April. The Tunnels added some new Cleaners and special variations of the Ridden to deal with, alongside the Ridden Hives.
With an Act 5 on the way and even more stuff to do, it&#x27;s nice to see that Back 4 Blood seems to be getting a steady cadence of post-launch support. It was a pretty good time for co-op at launch, and I really grew to like the card system that Turtle Rock created for this new variation on the co-op PvE survival game. Even if it hit some stumbles out of the gate, Back 4 Blood has kept on rolling on.
And if you like Turtle Rock&#x27;s particular brand of PvE, well, it&#x27;s a good time. Not only is Back 4 Blood getting some more content, but apparently the servers for Evolve have popped on and players have been dipping a toe back in.
As for the Children of the Worm, the new DLC expansion arrives on August 30 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>I like this lengthy eulogy the Wii U is getting
While the 3DS is shutting down its eShop early next year, another marketplace is dying a slow death. The Wii U YouTube app now has an end-of-life date, and so do two other services on the console.
As pointed out by Nintendo Everything, the YouTube support page for the Wii U was recently updated, stating: &quot;Note: The YouTube app is no longer available for new downloads from the Wii U eShop due to Nintendo’s upcoming discontinuation. Starting in October, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Wii U devices. Viewers can still enjoy YouTube on Nintendo Switch devices.&quot; Although the 3DS and Wii U shutdown is March 27, 2023, a few companies are getting things started a little earlier (to prepare for the other phase of the shutdown, where on August 29, 2022, you can&#x27;t use Nintendo eShop card funds on both marketplaces).
Crunchyroll is doing the same thing, as this Twitter user has revealed: they sent out an email to Wii U users that service was ending on August 29, 2022. Finally, Niconico has a page up similar to Google, which talks about the end of service, mostly for the 3DS app, which has been in operation since 2014.
It all makes sense, it&#x27;s just rare to be able to talk about the two systems these days: so I&#x27;m going to take every opportunity. Also, the below &quot;we&#x27;re sad to see you go&quot; image from Niconico is great. To see anyone even recognize the 3DS and Wii U in 2022 warms my heart.

I have been a fan of kaiju and Japanese giant monster films since a childhood friend lent me his VHS of Godzilla 1985 for a weekend. Eight years old at the time, I didn’t realize the movie was actually a pretty crappy Americanization of a far superior Japanese film. I just liked watching this big green lizard tear shit up. I watched the tape three times over that first weekend, forever changed by what I saw. To my eight-year-old mind, this was cinema.
By the time school rolled around on Monday, I was already making plans to scour my local video rental shops for whatever Shōwa and Heisei era Toho films they were hiding on their shelves. Once I was finished with all of those, I moved on to the video games, where my fanaticism was quickly tested. The world was st…</span>

The Two Point County Cinematic Universe (TPCCU) excites me. Two Point Studios launched Two Point Hospital with the intent of building a landscape where all their future games would happen. Two Point Campus is the next step. It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.
I’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience. Actually, I’ve been waiting for the next few steps.…</span>

Player First Games has announced that season one of its crazy crossover fighter MultiVersus has been delayed and will no longer meet its initially scheduled August 9 launch date. The developer announced that delay earlier today on social media, with a rescheduled date to be announced.
&quot;A big thank you to everyone playing MultiVersus. It’s exciting to see so many players enjoying the game and the launch of the Open Beta is just the beginning,&quot; said the team on Twitter. &quot;We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 &amp; the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players.&quot;
&quot;We’ll let you know the timing as soon as we can. We appreciate your patience &amp; enthusiasm and look forward to unveiling Season 1 very soon!&quot;

MultiVersus, which entered open beta just last week, has already had a very impressive opening, with the PC version logging an amazing peak of 144,000 players during its opening weekend. The free-to-play fighter quickly became the fourth most popular title on Steam, with the impressive figures not even taking into account additional player numbers for the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the beta.
As MultiVersus is still in its playtest stages, Player First Games is using this time to gather various feedback about the title, from its online connectivity and crossplay function, to in-game balance and various bugs that may need ironing out (and I ain&#x27;t just talking Bunny). If you want to check out the action for yourself, then all you need do is download the game client on the platform of your choice, and you&#x27;re ready to rock.
MultiVersus is in open beta now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Nintendo has dated them for September 9
It&#x27;s not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!
As a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they&#x27;ve been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists &quot;December 31, 2022&quot; as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a &quot;global release date&quot; system, it&#x27;s typically close enough barring regional delays.
Production on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it&#x27;ll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what&#x27;s left, we don&#x27;t know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.
As always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that&#x27;s been updated since 2015.
[Update: At the time of this update, Best Buy has the 2-pack in stock. This 2-pack format seems to be the way they&#x27;re being distributed all over the world, and is consistent with 2021 pre-orders.]

                              <span>Long-rumored remake finally announced
Square Enix has finally decided the time is right to officially lift the lid on one of the industry&#x27;s worst-kept secrets — the iconic developer has announced that Tactics Ogre: Reborn will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms on November 11.
Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a fresh remake of 2010 PSP release Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. Further confuddling matters, the 2010 release was, in itself, a remake of the 1995 Super Famicom edition of Let Us Cling Together — a title which would receive both PlayStation and Sega Saturn ports in the mid-&#x27;90s, but never venture outside of Japanese shores in any official capacity.

Konami and Apple Arcade teamed up for another game, and this one&#x27;s got a quirky musical twist. Amazing Bomberman flips the script on the series&#x27; familiar explosion-dodging action with score chasing and battlegrounds that change to suit the song.
As short as this trailer is, it&#x27;s worth a look.
https://youtu.be/cBxlRu3Fd5I
According to Konami, &quot;the bomb placement and explosion sounds change with the songs, and the battle time also changes depending on the song. When the song gets exciting, blocks will drop, and items may appear when you break them with bombs.&quot;
If you take a fireball to the face, you&#x27;ll careen off the screen — but you can revive &quot;as many times as you want as long as the song is playing.&quot;

A new stability patch is live for TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, across all platforms. The update is set to address bugs and make game stability improvements for all the turtle-powered action.
According to publisher Dotemu, the patch addresses some &quot;tedious bugs&quot; and adds a number of improvements, both for gameplay and online features.
&quot;Tribute Games to the rescue!&quot; Dotemu declared on Twitter, shouting out the TMNT developer alongside the announcement of the update.

The patch notes are fairly lengthy. In it, Tribute Games and Dotemu detail a number of fixes, some big and some small.
For example, under the Gameplay Bug Fixes, there&#x27;s a fix for enemies sometimes getting frozen after a Fling Slam. That&#x27;s a bit jarring to the acti…</span>

We&#x27;ve seen a lot of video game adaptations over the past few years, but none of them have been quite as successful as Riot&#x27;s League of Legends TV show Arcane. The Netflix series was praised by critics and fans alike, has already won multiple awards ahead of the 2022 Emmys, and Season 2 of the show has been confirmed for quite a while. Plenty of people are curious as to how Riot managed to pull off creating one of the best game-to-TV adaptations of all time, myself included, and now the studio is giving us a glimpse into their process of creating Arcane with a brand new docuseries.
This morning Riot released a trailer for the five-part docuseries called Arcane: Bridging the Rift, which will cover the series&#x27; development from the writers&#x27; room all the way up to its…</span>

                              <span>Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today&#x27;s news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We&#x27;ve enjoyed Ooblets whenever we&#x27;ve checked in on it over the years, so it&#x27;s exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.</span>

                              <span>Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. 
The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.</span>

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way. 
But the genre’s bubble gum aesthetics often mask a darker side – one prioritizing profit over peopl…</span>

                              <span>Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg&#x27;s game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn&#x27;t be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef

Mochizuki&#x27;s tweet reads, &quot;There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said.&quot;
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the classic Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and it’s releasing in just over three months. 
More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.” 
While waiting for Tactics Ogre: Reborn to hit PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC this November, read our thoughts on the original in the Game Informer Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together review. Check out this Game Informer Replay segment on Tactics Ogre after that.

                              <span>The crossover brawler of our dreams, MultiVersus, is the fighting genre&#x27;s latest prize winner. From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games&#x27; debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that&#x27;s left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ&#x27;s first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick &amp; Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 &amp; the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you&#x27;ll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James&#x27; butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, &quot;I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I&#x27;ve come away impressed with what I&#x27;ve played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year&#x27;s Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you&#x27;d rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.</span>

As someone who gets paid to have opinions about video games, I have to check myself a fair bit. Do I love a particular game because I&#x27;m blinded by nostalgia? Am I kinder to a particular genre because I have a soft spot for it, even if some of the games are a bit pants? Are there developers who I&#x27;m willing to forgive for their decisions because my emotions towards them? We all have various biases, it&#x27;s true.
But when it comes to Baby Park, I know I&#x27;m right.

The crypt has been silent for five years, reads the trailer for the new Crypt of the Necrodancer DLC. Frankly, we like our crypts silent, but we&#x27;re not Brace Yourself Games, a studio that presumably needs people to know about their games.
Crypt of the Necrodancer, the beloved rhythm-dungeon-crawler that would eventually spin off into a Nintendo-sanctioned Zelda collab, Cadence of Hyrule, is coming back from the dead with all-new DLC. The new content pack, which is called SYNCHRONY, will include new characters, items, enemies, traps, weapons, spells, shrines, and more.

Yesterday&#x27;s Pokémon Presents brought us a ton of new info on generation 9, Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. After some silence from Game Freak and The Pokémon Company on the upcoming open-world RPGs, we got a full 10 minutes of news, visuals, and info, and there are a lot of new features coming.
Of course, Scarlet &amp; Violet weren&#x27;t the only games that got some time in the limelight, but it&#x27;s what we&#x27;re probably most happy with. Because the rest of the presentation followed a pretty standard formula. Some of us loved what we saw, particularly from generation 9, but it also has some of us asking — have Pokémon Presents become a bit too predictable?

The Japanese charts for the week of 25th July to 31st July are in from Famitsu, and it&#x27;s a big week for RPGs and the Switch.
The top two spots are taken up by two brand-new releases this week. Monolith Soft&#x27;s Xenoblade Chronicles 3 runs away with the number one spot, selling a staggering 112,728 physical copies. No surprises here, really, as the game is reviewing incredibly well and was one of the most-anticipated launches on the Switch for this year.

Warning: As with all our Xenoblade Chronicles 3 guides, the following article contains spoilers.
There are multiple overlapping systems at work within Xenoblade Chronicles 3&#x27;s wonderfully strategic combat system. From returning elements such as auto-attacks, positional attacks, class-based tactics like drawing aggro and performing combos that break and topple your foes, to new stuff like that fancy new Interlinking shenanigans that sees you morph into powerful killing machines.

                              <span>A stumbling sophomore outing.
After the launch of Wave 1 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass, everyone and their nan turned their attention towards Wave 2; specifically, when on earth it would be coming out. Excitment reached fever pitch (just check out the comments section of any Mario Kart Tour related content if you don&#x27;t believe us!), so naturally, expectations for the latest batch of courses are exceedingly high. Was it all worth it, though? Let&#x27;s find out.
With the addition of Wave 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has now gained a total of sixteen new tracks so far in 2022. Just let that sink in for a moment: sixteen new tracks. It&#x27;s a five-year-old game, for goodness sake. Eight, if you count the original Wii U release! We&#x27;ve tried to keep this figure in mind when playing through these new courses and really look at the bigger picture here, because the new tracks on offer in the Turnip Cup and the Propeller Cup are a mixed bag, to say the least.

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of my favourite monitors, and I picked one up from Amazon the last time it was discounted. This week the 32-in model has been discounted to a similar price, so I thought I should let you all know about it!

This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

                              <span>Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics cards – their first real go at dedicated desktop gaming GPUs in modern times – are in a bit of a weird spot. If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

The newie is Turbo Golf Racing, which looks like Rocket League for minigolf and is hitting Game Pass on the very day it launches. Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;m back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I&#x27;ve brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we&#x27;d like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

                              <span>Charter Communications and several major record labels have settled their lawsuits over the ISP&#x27;s handling of repeat copyright infringers. The deal was signed around the same time that the ISP&#x27;s daughter company Bright House settled its case. No further details are available but with hundreds of millions of dollars in damages at stake, negotiations must have been tough.

Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters is now available on Switch is not something I ever thought I would be able to say out loud. But given the massive success of the platform, I guess it shouldn&#x27;t surprise me.
Thanks to a tip from a reader, it&#x27;s come to our attention that the game is now available on the eShop for $7.99, with no fanfare and no official announcement from the publisher or Nintendo&#x27;s weekly eShop drop. This edition is actually an &quot;arrangement&quot; of two games (Power Battle and the sequel, Power Fighters), in the form of a Neo Geo Pocket port. The gist of the &quot;Power&quot; spinoffs: you take Mega Man, Proto Man, and Bass (with Duo as a fourth option in the sequel) against a gauntlet of boss enemies (robot master…</span>

Three classic Resident Evil characters, including one of the series&#x27; most iconic villains, are joining in on the asymmetrical horror. Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker are all coming to Dead by Daylight soon.
Revealed today as part of Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s look-ahead showcase, the three characters arrive as part of an update called Resident Evil: Project W. It&#x27;s probably safe to say the &quot;W&quot; stands for Wesker.
While Albert Wesker, the Mastermind, will take on the role of Killer, two heroines are joining the roster to help the others out. Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong will be Survivors, part of the crew trying to evade the killer and make it out alive.

                              <span>FIFA&#x27;s final days keep EA in the premiership
It&#x27;s the turn of long-time developer/publisher Electronic Arts to share its results from the most recent quarter of the 2023 financial year. And while many publishers are showing a slump in overall revenue, EA seems to be relatively healthy, powered by its ongoing dominance over the sporting game industry.
Overall revenue for EA is up 14% year-on-year, which translates to a meaty $1.77 billion USD. Net income is also up — offering a huge 52% rise which equates to $311 million. It will probably come as zero surprise that the FIFA franchise is still one of the aces in EA&#x27;s portfolio, with FIFA Mobile and microtransactions service FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow in both revenue and users. FUT has, notably, seen its user base rise by 40% in the past 12 months.
It also seems that EA&#x27;s purchase of Codemasters was a very savvy decision, as the UK developer&#x27;s F1 22 has actually outperformed on the publisher&#x27;s expectations. Codemasters was, of course, purchased by EA for $1.2 billion back in early 2021. EA was hoping that the acquisition would give it a dominant stake in the racing game market, and it seems that the British studio is already delivering on those hopes.
This year&#x27;s FIFA entry, FIFA 23, will be the final football sim released with the official FIFA branding. While EA has a huge task ahead in rebranding one of the biggest and most profitable gaming franchises on the planet, the community knows where its dedication lies, and it seems hugely unlikely that the loss of the FIFA brand will harm EA&#x27;s bottom line in the bigger picture.

                              <span>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

                              <span>Throughout 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII&#x27;s Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren&#x27;t able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you&#x27;ve missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game&#x27;s launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million
Pokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million
Super Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million
Super Mario Party: 18.06 million
Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million
Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million
Ring Fit Adventure: 14.54 million
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well. Nintendo Switch Sports sold 4.84 million units, Mario Strikers: Battle League sold 1.91 million, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold 1.88 million units, making it the second-best selling Kirby game of all-time.

After that, feast your eyes upon all the new Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet revealed in today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents showcase.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game&#x27;s entitlement on Google Stadia but another&#x27;s rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month&#x27;s offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company&#x27;s new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.</span>

During the extended trailer and subsequent deep dive, we received new info about the region in which the games take place, how multiplayer works, some of the Pokémon players will encounter during their adventure, and the new Terastal phenomenon that allows Pokémon to change.
In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players embark on an adventure in the Paldea region, a massive area full of lakes, mountains, wastelands, and more. Outside of its natural lands…</span>

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling’s first triple-A wrestling title, AEW: Fight Forever, takes a few significant steps towards becoming a reality. After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW&#x27;s in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. 
First off, here’s what the box art looks like:

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the Fiscal Year 2023, which makes up the months of April, May, and June of 2022. While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. 
More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch&#x27;s sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

​NBA 2K is still in a rebuilding phase. While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year&#x27;s game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.
We still don&#x27;t have insight into any of this year&#x27;s modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan&#x27;s career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word &quot;authenticity&quot; to sum up this year&#x27;s changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:
Easier Play
More Pro for the Pro Stick
Hang on the Rim
Shooting is a Weapon
Killing Stalls with Adrenaline 
Defensive Play
Improved A.I.
Badges Sound More Confusing But Better?

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents, we got a ton of new info for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, the first open-world RPGs in the Pokémon franchise. Alongside all that information, The Pokémon Company released more than 50 new screenshots, showing off the Paldea regions open world, the characters and Pokémon that inhabit the vast area, and the new Terastal phenomenon that looks to play a significant role in gameplay.
Here are a couple to whet your appetite.

                              <span>Pulling killers isn’t something a lot of people dream about in real-life, but some Dead By Daylight fans are thirsty indeed for that game’s many murderous characters. Good news for them today then, because visual novel Hooked On You: A Dead By Daylight Dating Sim just surprise-launched exclusively on Steam. Watch the trailer below to see a more playful side to four of DBD’s serial killers, which isn’t something I ever thought I’d type.

Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors. Barricade yourself inside the police station of your mind and watch the trailer below.

That&#x27;s incredible value, working out as just 7 cents per gigabyte, and marks a sea change in the affordability of NVMe SSDs. 
(By comparison, the same drive costs £348 in the UK - the equivalent of $423.)

It combines building futuristic fortresses with raiding them for life-giving genetic material, either solo or in two-player online co-op. Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight. Check on how the post-apocalypse is faring in the trailer below.

                              <span>Even if you’re not “into” PC gaming hardware, spend enough time in its orbit and you’ll eventually develop a healthy scepticism for a specific type of electro-trickery. The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck software update, comprised of both a client update and SteamOS 3.3, is out now. It’s a fat stack of improvements and fixes, too, including a handful of brand new features.
You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

The second developer update video for Introversion&#x27;s space-everything game says, hey, this game isn&#x27;t about combat, and talks about user-made ships, mining vessels and, in an additional video, early player opinions of the playtest.

YouTube). Přímo HDR streamování pak funguje jen s YouTube HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) a formátem HEVC, OBS může pro zachytávání HDR streamu využívat hardware s podporou HDR (např. EVGA XR1 Pro, Elgato 4K60 Pro Mk.2, AverMedia Live Gamer 4K). S HDR však nefungují některé filtry (Apply LUT, Chroma Key, Color Key, Image Mask/Blend, Luma Key, Sharpness). HDR také bude funkční zatím jen na Windows, na macOS a Linuxu je podpora nehotová.</span>

The platform muted a stream of a popular Spanish streamer who participated in a high-profile event. The game&#x27;s indie developers believe that there&#x27;s a copyright troll at work and advise gamers to stay away from emergency vehicles while they try to find a fix.

The order is the latest in a long line of anti-piracy actions in France, where fledgling regulatory body Arcom has added hundreds of domains to the country&#x27;s official blacklist in just a few months.

                              <span>We spotted a rare discount on Lenovo&#x27;s brand new Legion 5i Pro 16 laptop, and it&#x27;s a high-end model with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and a stunning 16-in 2560x1600 165Hz display. Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

                              <span>Right now a combination of a Box discount and an Ebay voucher code are making two MSI AiO liquid CPU coolers extremely cheap. The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

                              <span>With cancelled pre-order comes small discount. Isn’t that the motto of Spider-Man? Well, it’s close enough under the circumstances. Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

It has a little more background for the main characters, and introduces their cyborg posse. Watch the very edgy trailer below.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

                              <span>Herschel &quot;Guy&quot; Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a &quot;AAA game studio&quot; with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio&#x27;s first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it&#x27;s a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society&#x27;s first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it&#x27;s less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games.

As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t help that Beahm tweeted, &quot;I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine&quot; back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty&#x27;s visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen.

Even if you&#x27;ve made it rich in Sea of Thieves and are loaded to the gills in gold, you can only purchase one of each type of ship: the Sloop, Brigantine, and Galleon. Within the teaser video above, we see the Sloop goes for 250,000 gold, the Brigantine for 375,000, and the four-person Galleon at 500,000. Once one of these vessels is yours for the keeping, you can give it a name, and it&#x27;ll appear on a wooden plaque on the ship&#x27;s crest.

                              <span>To reduce piracy on the Switch console, last week Nintendo used a DMCA notice to target a popular &#x27;sigpatch&#x27; repository on Github. While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

                              <span>Začátkem července zamířil do projektu Mesa přepsaný NIR backend R600g vylepšující běh OpenGL pro Radeony HD 5000 a HD 6000, tedy pre-GCN modely generace Evergreen. Pár týdnů práce vývojářů (no, vlastně jde prakticky jen o Gerta Wollnyho) nyní vyústilo v rozšíření této funkcionality i na starší modely. Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.</span>

The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

                              <span>While the Tour De France Femmes ended on Sunday and the Tour Hommes the week before, I&#x27;ll not be rushed on my own Tour De Jeux. I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will finally hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC too, in just a few months – Oct. 25 to be exact – and Warner Bros and WB Montreal have been steadily releasing more and more information about the multiplayer Bat-family game. 
Today, as part of IGN First coverage, the studio released the first 16 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay and the focus is exclusively on Batgirl. If you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, don&#x27;t fret – there&#x27;s not much revealed story-wise in this gameplay, but it does feature a look at the first mission as well as some of the in-game mechanics we&#x27;ll be utilizing to solve mysteries and fight crime. According to the video, this takes place right after the prologue. 
Check it out for yourself below:

After that, check out Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s executive producer and director for details about alternate suits, missions, and the Elseworlds-like cooperative play.

                              <span>The year 2020 was a big year for the Cyberpunk genre in video games because the hotly-anticipated (and long-in-development) Cyberpunk 2077 was finally released that year. However, it wasn&#x27;t the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. 
I played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I&#x27;m glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR&#x27;s latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

This news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney. Running nearly two and a half minutes long, this trailer sets up the beginning of a rebellion led by Andor and others such as Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma (all played by the actors that portrayed them in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). You can check it out for yourself below: 


Elsewhere, Disney also released a fancy new illustrated poster for Andor today:

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. 
One of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. 
“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” 
If you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. 
You’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).
In the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review.

                              <span>If you are like me and are a child from the 90s you probably remember the Sonic games quite fondly. You also try really hard not to think about how long ago the 90s really were... but I digress...

Now is your chance to relive (or perhaps live for the first time?) the classic collected adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD in the newly remastered Sonic Origins! We have 20 codes to give away so, for your chance at one, all you have to do is enter below and submit your console choice. Extra entries are available with one daily entry option as well. 
Enter until 11:59 PM CST on August 10th, 2022. Sonic Origins is rated E for everyone. Minors will need their parents&#x27; permission to accept the prize. Full rules are available below. Good Luck!

                              <span>Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

                              <span>Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest update introduced a new player reporting tool, which allows players to submit &quot;inappropriate chat messages or dangerous behaviour&quot; for moderators to review. That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren&#x27;t happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don&#x27;t like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

                              <span>To have an extremely timely conversation: how do you feel about this year&#x27;s games so far? And how do you feel about this question in the first place? I&#x27;ve had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that&#x27;s down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>SmoothStreams - one of the most reliable and well-known pirate IPTV providers  - suddenly went offline this month. A two-week TorrentFreak investigation has determined that members of MPA-Canada and ACE, including Bell and Rogers, have been tracking the service&#x27;s operators for years. Legal action is already underway, but the process isn&#x27;t going exactly to plan.

                              <span>All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA&#x27;s official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don&#x27;t think so, you can call into Madden NFL&#x27;s ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA&#x27;s snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA&#x27;s involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...
@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ

89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!
#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE

Yo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!
#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X
July 28, 2022
The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year&#x27;s ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player&#x27;s rating? We&#x27;ll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I&#x27;d call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.

                              <span>One of the allures of PC gaming is building your rig to the specs you need. Last year, while I didn&#x27;t pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT&#x27;s streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.
If you don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.
When you go to Build Redux&#x27;s website, you see the option to build your PC, but not in the way you would expect. You pick your top three games from a preset list of f…</span>

                              <span>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23&#x27;s on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We&#x27;ll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix&#x27;s Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA&#x27;s Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>&quot;A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.&quot; This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game&#x27;s fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can&#x27;t dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game&#x27;s other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 03 update, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</span>

However, in a piracy case filed by adult entertainment company Strike 3 the purported &quot;Hollywood style quality&quot; of the porn videos is now a topic of contention.

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

                              <span>During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

                              <span>Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as &quot;angry playmobil&quot;. I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

                              <span>Earlier this month, RPS turned 15 years old, so it only seemed right that this month&#x27;s Time Capsule entry should be the year of our birth: 2007. Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

                              <span>Today saw indie publisher Annapurna Interactive’s second showcase, highlighting all the new games that you can expect from them over the course of the next year and beyond. There was some fresh gameplay for Thirsty Suitors and Hindsight, plus a newly revealed game from Wilmot’s Warehouse devs Hollow Ponds. We were treated to a few glimpses at what Kentucky Route Zero team Cardboard Computer and If Found… devs Dreamfeel are working on too. The latter involves cats.
Don’t fret if you didn’t catch the Annapurna Interactive stream today, because we’ve got all the info you need to know right here. Read on!

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

                              <span>The world’s greatest detective who isn’t Batman will once again tangle with the many-tentacled forces of darkness in an upcoming remake of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

                              <span>I really appreciate when games don&#x27;t hold your hand. They don&#x27;t waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

                              <span>ISP Bright House and several music companies go to trial next week. In preparation, a Florida federal court has set some rules for what can and what can&#x27;t be brought up before the jury. Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can&#x27;t freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

RCMP officers raided GaloTV (Soltv) in 2021, seizing hundreds of set-top boxes, receivers and broadcasting devices. One of the men was previously sued by DISH and agreed to settle a civil suit for more than half a billion dollars.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.</span>

                              <span>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.
A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</span>

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. 


Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you&#x27;re not blasting apart enemies, you&#x27;ll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister&#x27;s wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex&#x27;s emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala&#x27;s mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It&#x27;s a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you&#x27;re still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.</span>

We get shots of the team members animating a dog&#x27;s face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy. 
Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero here.</span>

During The Playlist, Van Aken raves about Rollerdrome and shares why it&#x27;s one of his most anticipated games after playing it. To round out the show, we answer a few listener questions about how the Steam Deck compares to the Nintendo Switch and which portable games we&#x27;d like to re-release onto home consoles.

                              <span>During February’s Nintendo Direct, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got a lot of overdue attention with the announcement of 48 race tracks – new and old – coming to the arcade racer by 2023. The first wave dropped in March alongside a 2.0 update. Wave 2 is just around the bend and promises the Turnip and Propeller Cups next month. This means we’re getting some familiar courses across multiple consoles, including the Super NES, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, Wii, and Mario Kart Tour games. Here are the details for each cup based on a recent press release:

                              <span>Now&#x27;s the time to claim Japan&#x27;s seedy underbelly for yourself. Yakuza: Like A Dragon is packaged into the free PlayStation Plus August catalog. However, eight other Yakuza are coming to the subscription service starting this month.
According to the official PlayStation blog, Extra and Premium members can download/play Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s classic, crime-riddled journeys in Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 next month. Later this year, those same subscribers get access to Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, and Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. That&#x27;s hundreds of hours of fantastic Ryu Ga Gotoku content. Be sure to check out our reviews or previews for the games below:

Yakuza 6

Last week, screenshots of the next Yakuza game surfaced. Whether we&#x27;re in for a numbered entry or sequel to Like A Dragon remains to be seen. But we know that the lovable Ichiban Kasuga and co. are making their triumphant return.</span>

It’s Tuesday morning. I’m late. I’ve missed the embargo deadline for Rollerdrome. Across the games press, website authors have already published previews and stories about their time playing Roll7’s blood-packed sports title. 
But I can’t stop playing Rollerdrome. 
Instead of writing, I once again queue the Barbican Arena competition, the last leg in my six-level demo. The level begins in a long, claustrophobic tunnel lit in red light. I have everything I need – rollerskates and a shotgun – to put on the show of a lifetime. Ahead of me are echoes of a crowd clapping in unison, an ominous metronome inv…</span>

                              <span>Since the disclosure of Retbleed earlier this month as the newest CPU security vulnerability around speculative execution, I&#x27;ve posted some Intel/AMD benchmarks looking at the mitigation cost for the affected older generations of processors. Last week I also looked at the accumulated CPU mitigation cost on AMD Zen 1. Today is a similar comparison over on the Intel Xeon E3 v5 &quot;Skylake&quot; side with looking at the cost of just the Retbleed mitigations and then the overall CPU mitigation cost when toggling all of the various vulnerabilities with the &quot;mitigations&#x3D;off&quot; flag.</span>

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

                              <span>Strategy games are the go-to option when you&#x27;re looking for something to really get your brain working. But they can seem unreachable when your synapses are being melted from without rather than through overuse. Happily, we found an excellent solution last summer, and being a wily fox, I had a plan ready for this year. 2022&#x27;s now-traditional Low-Intensity Strategy Game For When Burny Light Make Think Hard is, of course, The Battle For Polytopia.

                              <span>When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. &quot;Usually, by the time a game comes out, I&#x27;ve compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven&#x27;t done that with Hob&#x27;s Barrow yet,&quot; he says. &quot;Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it.&quot;
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce &quot;Incantamentum&quot; correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. &quot;I said, &#x27;Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you&#x27;re going to be adding voice acting to this because it&#x27;s screaming for it&#x27;,&quot; Gilbert tells me. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, we will if we can find a publisher who&#x27;ll do it for us.&#x27;&quot; So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

                              <span>There are some things in this world that just take you completely by surprise. Drop bears, for example. It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998&#x27;s terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser. You can watch the original pitch trailer for Jurassic World that Blackley created below.

                              <span>More information about Rockstar’s next Grand Theft Auto game has slipped out of a new report from Bloomberg. Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series&#x27; history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

See, Animal Crossing and animated Disney movies have both long been big deals in the Wheeler household, and the new game seemed to be riffing heavily on the former. A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.
