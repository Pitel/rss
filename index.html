                              <span>RPS supporters, who are very generous and probably smell fantastic, might recall a post last week in which I gushed about an Electriq eiQ-32M4K144FS that I’d bought secondhand. What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.


This is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel.

Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.

I got into the works of Yasuhiro Nightow at a really young age. Pretty much directly after being mesmerized by Trigun, I knew I had to follow his work through any means necessary. That loyalty paid off when he got involved in video game development: partially helming the Gungrave franchise, which became an anime based on the first game.
He&#x27;s had a crazy career, and it isn&#x27;t done yet based on Gungrave Gore (and that upcoming Trigun anime).

Gungrave Gore (PC, PS4, PS5 [review], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Iggymob Co.,Ltd
Publisher: Prime Matter
Released: November 22, 2022
MSRP: $49.99
I&#x27;m of the opinion that we need more games that say &quot;Kick Their Ass&quot; at the start of every level, full stop. I got that with Gungrave Gore, as the slogan really helps sell its general vi…</span>

There are a lot of Pokemon games. This should come as no surprise, given Pokemon is the largest media franchise in the world and has over 25 years of history. Still, if you haven’t followed the series since its first generation, deciphering it can be overwhelming.
The mainline Pokemon series is classified by “generations.&quot; This is because many Pokemon games are virtually identical, save for a handful of differences or a few enhancements. For example, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet are similar enough that only hardcore fans will play both. This can get especially confusing once you include remakes and rereleases of past Pokemon games. There are over ten games that could be considered “Generation 1,” and you only need to play one of them!

                              <span>Sin brings a flag and some meat to the party
A familiar face is returning to Guilty Gear with a fresh look. Sin Kiske is the next fighter to join the Guilty Gear Strive roster as part of its Season 2 pass, arriving on November 24.
Sin, the son of Guilty Gear mainstay Ky Kiske and Dizzy, shows up here as the &quot;ever-growing wild boy.&quot; He&#x27;s still wielding his flag weapon. And yes, he can still pull out a hunk of meat to chow down on, mid-match.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZQoNLBJ0xSc
The younger Kiske also makes mention of his mom, lending more fuel to the fire that we might see Dizzy alongside Sin Kiske in Guilty Gear Strive. As for gameplay, IGN had a special presentation revealing the new trailer, as well as some gameplay demonstration of Sin Kiske and how he&#x27;s changed for Strive.
He&#x27;s got a special bar, a stamina bar, rather than his hunger meter. He seems to have some interesting potential in his follow-ups using this gauge, as well as a buff he can pick up from chowing down on some grub mid-fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;gMfsw4BwiNI
The fight continues
At the end of the Sin trailer, we also get confirmation that two more fighters are due out in 2023 as part of Season 2. It looks like the content roadmap shown off earlier this year is holding up.
Crossplay is also hopefully getting officially integrated soon, as its held some beta tests already. Considering an Xbox release is set for next spring, that will be of interest to the new platform&#x27;s players.
As for the last remaining fighters? Well, Slayer seems to be a much-requested addition, and Dizzy getting mentioned in the trailer plants some speculation. I&#x27;ve really liked the original characters so far too, though, so I hope there&#x27;s at least one more newcomer in the pipeline for Strive.

We just wrapped our first weekend with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the latest games in the long-running series. It&#x27;s got a lot of new features, from the open world structure to Tera Types. But I was eager to kick the tires of one major function of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and that&#x27;s multiplayer.
While the Pokemon series has had multiplayer since Red and Blue, it&#x27;s been mostly just trading and battling. The Let&#x27;s Go series might have allowed dual Trainers, but not individual avatars brought in from their own games and worlds.
In Scarlet and Violet, Game Freak opens the doors for players to form groups and explore the open world together. Up to four Trainers can link up using a room code and play in one instance together, via the Po…</span>

                              <span>Wii miss U
The Wii U turned 10 last week, and boy oh boy, what a weird-and-sad-but-endearing flop that was. It sold about 1/10 as well as its predecessor, and common consensus is, people passed on it because they didn&#x27;t realize it was a new system. I think the real problem though was that people felt like it was just another Wii thing. They could have just asked Google, or a store clerk, if it was a new console, but they didn&#x27;t. They were too bored to.
By 2012, the Wii brand instantly put people to sleep. The market had been flooded with so much Wii stuff by that time that anything that said &quot;Wii&quot; on it was instantly sent to the &quot;ignore&quot; section of people&#x27;s brains.

Switch emulation is a thing, and it&#x27;s something Nintendo obviously isn&#x27;t happy about - with a lot of first-party releases often leaking ahead of official street dates, and in most cases, running on other devices at much higher resolutions and frame rates.
Nintendo&#x27;s taken action in the past against piracy and emulation, and most recently it&#x27;s gone on another DMCA spree. Following the leak of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet, Nintendo is now targeting images of Switch games being published on the website SteamGridDB.

Nintendo has locked in a 28th November release date for the golf update. This update will come packed with 21 holes from the Wii Sports series. There&#x27;ll also be casual competition options and an eight-player &#x27;Survival Golf&#x27; mode.

If golf is a great way to ruin a walk, fishing must therefore be the best way to ruin a perfectly good drowning. Traumatizing the most food-motivated creature on earth is a reasonably relaxing pastime, don’t get me wrong, but when I’d go out on the lake with my father, he’d always over-coach. I don’t even know how that’s possible, but that man found a way.
Cocoto Fishing Master found its way into my collection because my husband really loves the fish on the cover. “It’s just so happy!” he’d exclaim, using this playful but unspellable vowel pronunciation that we’ve developed over our years of being that really weird couple. So, while seeking my next kusoge to write about, I figured I could do worse than a game that is only in my …</span>

There is absolutely nothing more frustrating than playing your very best in an online game, only to be taken out by some technical issue that&#x27;s outside of your control. How does the old saying go? Oh yeah: &quot;Video games don&#x27;t cause violence, lag does.&quot; Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 players are in a world of hurt right now, but not because of lag; there&#x27;s a bug floating around right now that causes enemies to become completely invisible. I can&#x27;t think of anything more rage-inducing than that.
Originally reported by PCGamesN, there&#x27;s currently a lot of mystery surrounding the issue. Players can&#x27;t seem to find any reason for the Warzone bug, or a way to trigger it in game. Some are even calling foul play, suggesting that hackers might be using the bug as an exploit int…</span>

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are out in the wild, and players have been discovering all kinds of weird glitches and tricks. One in particular involves not just a copy of the new Pokemon, but two controllers too.
As discovered and shared over on Reddit, you can use two controllers to make your Trainer in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet run faster than usual. Others, including myself, have since verified that it does indeed work.
This seems to really only work in handheld mode, in my experience. And likely best with Pro Controller and attached Joy-Cons as the configuration; the Reddit video uses Joy-Cons, but a Pro and Joy-Con combo felt better to use in my case.

It&#x27;s a bit finicky to manage, as you have to tilt both sticks at an angle. But it definitely felt li…</span>

While Good Smile Company&#x27;s catalogue of delightful Nendoroid toys is well into three figures, it is staggering to believe that WayForward&#x27;s cute genie gal Shantae was still yet to join the roster. After all, The Half-Genie Hero seems custom designed for such pint-sized stylization.

Well, after years of longing, Good Smile has finally opened pre-orders on the new Nendo of the purple-haired wonder, ready to come dancing out of the screen and onto your toy shelf. As is the case for all Nendoroids, Shantae stands around four inches in height and features dynamically poseable limbs, so you can have our gal cutting a rug in any way you choose.
In terms of accessories, Shantae comes complete with a stand and three separate faceplates, offering her a cute smile, a cheeky wink, or as much of an &quot;angry face&quot; as she can muster... Somebody gon&#x27; get a hair-whuppin&#x27;. Shantae also has alternate arms posed for dancing, pointing, and fireball flinging, as well as a replacement ponytail in freeform whip action. As the cherry on the cake, Shantae is accompanied by a teeny figurine, reflecting her Monkey form from the smash hit series. Adorbs.

If you fancy inviting the Shantae Nendo into your home, then she is available to pre-order from the Good Smile Co. website and other dedicated merch retailers, priced at ¥8,900, (roughly $57), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. The Shantae Nendoroid is expected to ship in summer 2023.
Now we just need to get Rotty, Risky and other friends in the mix.

D3 Publisher has released a 10-minute gameplay video of its anime hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash adventure Samurai Maiden. Developed by Japanese studio Shade, the action-packed tale of swords and sorcery will hit PlayStation, PC and Nintendo Switch platforms in early December.
Utilizing the time-honored marriage of anime schoolgirls and time travel, Samurai Maiden sees a young lass from the 21st Century whisked back to Sengoku era Japan where, accompanied by her newfound friends, our hero takes up steel against a deathly army of monsters and ghouls. As she battles her way through the underworld, our young maiden will mastery the ancient art of the samurai, defeating ungodly creatures on her journey to return to her own time.

Despite the overall cheesiness of the characters and setup, I have to admit that I think Samurai Maiden looks pretty sharp (pun fully intended). I&#x27;m digging the super-colorful locations, the crazy-creepy enemy design, and the slick-looking combat. The visual effects also aren&#x27;t to be sniffed at. The action appears to move both smoothly and with precision, and overall it looks like it could be a fun, low-key, way to spend a lazy weekend... Even if you do gotta roll your eyes a little at the game&#x27;s &quot;kiss other girls to power up&quot; mechanic.
I mean, that&#x27;s never worked for me, and I&#x27;ve tried it over three times in my life.
Samurai Maiden launches worldwide, December 8, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all about perspective
Fun news for puzzle fans: Pillow Castle Games&#x27; extraordinarily smart adventure Superliminal is now available on ninth-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, following on from its critically acclaimed 2019 release on PC and consoles.
For those less inclined, Superliminal, (also known as Museum of Simulation Technology), is a first-person adventure title in the vein of Valve&#x27;s iconic puzzler Portal, and follows a protagonist as they attempt to escape from a looping dream sequence, guided by the voice of a mysterious overseer. Superliminal&#x27;s &quot;kick&quot; lies in the concept of optical illusions, and tasks the player with escaping a series of chambers utilizing elements of forced perspective, object scaling, and the manipulation of the third dimension in order to craft a path to the exit.
Better demonstrated than explained, you can check out the action in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4KY87ldajFY
The new PS5/Xbox Series X port of Superliminal supports 4K resolution with a framerate of 60 frames per second. In addition, the ports receive the recently patched &quot;Developer mode&quot;, which includes commentary from the team at Pillow Castle, and &quot;Challenge Mode&quot;, which limits the number of movements that the player is allowed to perform in each chamber, requiring a little more forethought before attempting each topsy-turvy situation. Best of all, these new editions are now available as free upgrades for all players who already own Superliminal on PS4 and Xbox One respectively.
Now go get your brain melted.
Superliminal is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

It&#x27;s that time of year again! Deals are happening, and some of them involve deep discounts. While Steam is usually the place to go for some insane 90%+ off sales, Nintendo is getting in the swing of the holiday season with some decent deals, especially on some third party games.
In terms of first party, we have Fire Emblem: Three Houses (and DLC), Kirby Star Allies, Luigi&#x27;s Mansion (plus DLC), Mario Tennis Aces, New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury, and Zelda: Skyward Sword HD all in the mix. Some of the bigger third party gets include Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes and No More Heroes 3 for 50% off, on top of a few smaller discounts on newer/new-ish games.
Now is a pretty decent time to go all-in on Fire Emblem: Three Houses, to be frank.…</span>

Team Ninja is not done with its flagship franchises Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive — What&#x27;s more, it appears that the Japanese developer is actually making preparations to reboot both franchises for something of a fresh start for both long-running series.
At the G-Star conference in Busan, South Korea this weekend, Team Ninja President Fumihiko Yasuda held a panel on the future of the studio. As part of Yasuda&#x27;s presentation, a slide was shown that featured logos and images from action RPG franchise Ninja Gaiden, and 3D scrapper series Dead or Alive, complete with a header of &quot;Reboots of popular series&quot;. A translation from Ruliweb suggests that Yasuda said news of these projects would arrive &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.
The last mainline Ninja Gaiden release was 2012&#x27;s Ninja Gaiden 3, …</span>

                              <span>A notebook and a highlighter set
Another first part Nintendo release: another My Nintendo reward. This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.
Here&#x27;s all we know at the moment:
&quot;Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info.&quot;

The notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It&#x27;s hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.
Also, it&#x27;s very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) &quot;sell out&quot; of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Last week saw the arrival of the latest releases in the decades-long Pokemon franchise, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet — And, despite plenty of misgivings in regards to the games&#x27; performance, the two Nintendo Switch titles have still rocketed up the UK charts, debuting in the coveted No.1 spot.
As noted by GamesIndustry.biz, not only are the two titles enjoying the biggest physical video game launch of 2022, but Scarlet &amp; Violet are also the second-highest grossing launch of any Pokemon titles in the territory, just behind 2016 Nintendo 3DS releases Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon. Games that saw their launch sales hugely bolstered by the accompanying Pokemon GO craze of that same year.
The UK launch sales for Scarlet &amp; Violet are up 25% over 2019&#x27;s Sword &amp; Shiel…</span>

                              <span>Project Winter is one of the best social deduction games you can play on your PC. You could uncharitably call it the grumpy rules lawer uncle of Among Us, smothering the raw thrill of lies and accusation beneath a blanket of systems and complexities. I had an absolute blast with it a few years ago, though, and for my money the highs absolutely make that blanket worth snuggling under.
I get to tell you about it again because the Power Balance: Vol 2 Update came out last week, adding a couple more roles and new systems that give traitors more strategies to turn to.

                              <span>If Twitter does die, I will miss it. Amidst the wailing lie certain gems, like this thread of developers sharing confessions and cheeky tricks from across their careers. We&#x27;re talking cobbling rat-tunnel ducts together to form a makeshift flare launcher in Dishonored, or using the bottom of a bleach bottle as a stand-in for a light fixture. I&#x27;ve picked out some of my favourites - come and revel in them with me.

Season 8 of Sea Of Thieves goes live tomorrow, bringing on-demand ship combat and a faction system that pits goodly ghost-pirates against evil skeleton-pirates. It&#x27;s all woven into the existing open world, with your ship plunging beneath the waves when you tell it you want to go a-hunting.
If you want more info, you can watch the devs launch into an appropriately deep dive in their latest update video.

All four are now significantly cheaper than they were on launch, and with similar discounts to DDR5 RAM and AM5 motherboards, it&#x27;s a great time to build a new Ryzen 7000 PC.

A 15-person mapping team has channelled all the grief and rage from Foddy&#x27;s hit fall &#x27;em up into a 15-story tower that genuinely hurts my eyes to look at.
There&#x27;s a $500+ prize pool to be shared between the first three people who can complete the damn thing. The map came out five days ago, and as yet nobody has.

                              <span>There was a period, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, where myself and a few friends – even some that don’t normally indulge in games – played little else besides Golf With Your Friends. It’s a 12-player crazy golf game that dials up the crazy, and as we soon found back in those pre-vaccine days, one that reaches a whole other level of club-and-ball chaos with a single settings tweak.


See, with ball collision switched off, Golf With Your Friends is pretty fun. The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series era Wireless Controller is one of the best options for PC gaming, and now it&#x27;s down to £29.99 at Currys when you use the code FNDDGAMING and choose to collect. These controllers normally retail £54.99, making this a solid £25 discount! 
This is one of the best early Black Friday PC deals we&#x27;ve spotted so far, and well worth picking up for games that benefit from controller input, like those in the racing, platformer, action and fighting genres. Of course, it&#x27;s also an essential pickup if you like playing around with emulators, and of course works on two generations of Xbox consoles as well.

                              <span>Battle royales can be very confusing, what with all the running and gunning. What if you could just lie there and let the weapons deal with all that shooting hassle by themselves? One Warzone 2 player happened across exactly that scenario, but it didn’t do them much good. Appearances can be deceiving though, so it’s not entirely clear how a gun can start shooting itself. That sure does seem buggy.

                              <span>Cute and compelling life simulator My Time At Sandrock is bringing back characters from My Time At Portia, along with new areas to explore and quests to give their lives purpose. If you played Portia and bid sad goodbyes to Albert, Mint and Musa, you can look forward to being reunited over an extra 5-10 hours of dungeons, romance and whatnot when the Old Pals update lands on November 24th.
I haven&#x27;t played either game, but Steve Hogarty described Sandrock as &quot;Stardew Valley with a gun&quot;, so I probably should.

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s journey comes to an end on December 6th with the arrival of title update 1.6.2 for the historical action RPG, along with the free The Last Chapter DLC. That concludes Eivor’s story, but unfortunately you won’t be able to continue your medieval adventures in New Game Plus. Ubisoft have confirmed that there won’t be any such mode coming to the game.

                              <span>Season 2 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus began last week, bringing with it a fresh battle pass for players to dig into. They’ll definitely be digging for a while too, because this season the amount of XP needed to complete the battle pass has nearly doubled. As MultiVersus tweeter and data miner LaisulMV noted, to complete the original Season 1 battle pass you’d need to accrue 47,650 XP to make it from Level 1 to Level 50. Season 2’s battle pass, on the other hand, requires a total of 87,450 XP. Levels 41-50 alone take almost as much effort as the first season’s entire battle pass, weighing in at 46,200 XP.

Black Friday 2022 is upon us and we’ll be covering it a bit differently to previous years – better, hopefully, albeit still in a way where an explanation might help. Basically, we’ll still be highlighting good hardware deals through our Black Friday hubs and the occasional standalone post, but this time we’re teaming up with our Gamer Network friends/colleagues/corporate co-underlings at Eurogamer and Digital Foundry to share the load.

                              <span>Warzone 2 deployed less than a week ago, and players are already experiencing déjà vu because of an outbreak of invisible players. This isn’t the first time the Warzone series has been affected by glitchy, unseen combatants, but we don’t have any answers yet for why it’s happening again. The invisibility glitch had attention drawn to it over the weekend, when streamer SuperEv shared a video of being taken out by another player who didn’t seem to be there. The Warzone 2.0 Trello board listing known issues with the game doesn’t show any mention of known invisibility bugs yet, so stay frosty.

Note: This Cloud Version of Resident Evil 2 was tested on 100MB UW Broadband over WiFi and wired ethernet cable, along with a 5G mobile connection.

Following up Resident Evil 2 — whether it’s the 1998 original or the 2019 remake — is no easy task. Indeed, in the run-up to the launch of the PlayStation 2, Capcom found itself in a tricky position: the company was in the midst of producing multiple Resident Evil projects, yet none would be ready for Sony’s next console debut. As such, it saw fit to upgrade a smaller, spin-off title to mainline status in order to satiate a vastly expanding audience, and so Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was born.

                              <span>Colour us intrigued.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are out now and fans have had a lot to say about the new generation of Pokémon. We&#x27;ve all now had a weekend to get acquainted with the world of Paldea and its inhabitants, and we&#x27;ve already seen a whole bunch of hot takes around the internet, ranging from folks professing this to be the greatest new entry in the franchise history, to disappointing takes bemoaning the obvious lack of polish from developer Game Freak.
Of course, our own review has been live for several days now, and we fall somewhere in the middle with a score of 7/10. We think that the game makes some significant changes to the Pokémon formula for the good, but also acknowledge that there are some concerning instances of poor frame rate and underbaked visuals. Check out our full review below:

The Wii U is now ten years old. Crazy, right?
The successor to the WIi launched back in November 2012 to - shall we say - lukewarm reception. Nevertheless, for fans of Nintendo, it remains a quaint and beloved entry to the company&#x27;s console line-up, introducing the likes of Splatoon, Xenoblade Chronicles X, and ZombiU to the masses.

                              <span>The ultimate sick day.
There have been a lot of glitches in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet which have taken us by surprise over the games&#x27; first few days in the wild. But apart from ruining selfies, increasing sprint speeds and granting long jump abilities, we hadn&#x27;t seen one that actually bypasses the games&#x27; story... until now, that is.
As pointed out by u/GalaxyHunter17 on Reddit, there is a certain loophole in the game which, should you follow it, lets you can skip the first day of school and seemingly the start of the story too. The glitch itself relatively spoiler-free, though there are some locations and description of where the game&#x27;s tutorial will take you in the following details. Therefore, if you are hoping to go into the games completely fresh, we have to mention the following:

                              <span>There&#x27;s a serious catch here.
When Pokémon GO was first announced, the Pokémon GO Plus wristband was a near-essential companion. This officially-licensed accessory allowed you to interact with the game even when your phone was in your pocket; a flashing LED button on the device would alert you to nearby Pokéstops and Pokémon, and a quick press would initiate either a spin or a catch attempt.
Nintendo replaced the Go Plus with the Poké Ball Plus (which could also be used in Pokémon GO Let&#x27;s Go), but since then, the company hasn&#x27;t expanded on this concept – leaving third-party accessory makers to fight one another to create the ultimate Pokémon GO companion device.

See you later, alligator? How about see you very soon, crocodile? Sure, it doesn&#x27;t rhyme, but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening! Playtonic Friends is publishing Lil Gator Game (yes, that&#x27;s the final title) on the Nintendo Switch and the PC this year, and it finally has a release date.
Lil Gator Game is a wholesome adventure in which you play the titular lil gator on a quest to make friends and find secrets. There&#x27;s climbing! There&#x27;s swimming! There&#x27;s gliding! It&#x27;s very similar to A Short Hike, but you get to hit things with a stick, too!

Update : You might remember that back in August we were quite frankly amazed at a huge Minecraft project by Grazzy which saw the builder attempting to recreate the entire Breath of the Wild map in glorious blocky detail. Well, while the world is still far from completion, Grazzy has shared a new update, showing us the addition of Zora&#x27;s Domain, Divine Beast Vah Ruta, Mount Lanayru and much, much more.
In the latest update, Grazzy maps a course east from Kakariko Village, continuing to recreate Breath of the Wild&#x27;s greatly detailed map in, well, great detail. Seeing everything that we have so far, we wondered whether we might have gone numb to the scope of the project by now, but come on, that Vah Ruta is seriously impressive - it has a full interior for crying out loud!

Every now and again, the world seems to collectively decide that the way things were X number of years ago was the peak of culture. This happens everywhere: Fashion, movies, makeup, and even language tend to rely on this ever-revolving cycle of nostalgia, fuelled by a yearning for the childhood memories of whoever happens to be in charge.
Video games, despite being a relatively new medium, are not exempt from this — although the exact games and aesthetics that we are nostalgic for vary from person to person. You can feel the nostalgia seeping through the screen in games like Lucas Pope&#x27;s early Mac-inspired 1-bit game Return of the Obra Dinn, or La-Mulana&#x27;s imitation of old MSX visuals. And now, in a twist of the knife for anyone over 30, the nostalgia cycle has hit the DS game era, in the gorgeously chunky outlines and delicious dithering of upcoming Switch game, Demonschool.

It&#x27;s not even been one month since the launch of Bayonetta 3, yet series creator and vice-president at PlatinumGames, Hideki Kamiya, has already started talking about a potential sequel.
Speaking on Twitter, Kamiya made direct reference to the ending of Bayonetta 3. While we won&#x27;t spoil what happens here (and please be mindful in the comments!), it&#x27;s safe to say that the conclusion has proven to be quite divisive among fans.

With the Season of Light in full swing across Pokémon GO, Niantic has announced that a brand new Ultra Beast event will be coming to London later this week on 26th November.
The in-person event will take place on the River Terrace at Somerset House and will feature a visual Ultra Beast experience as well as photo opportunities and giveaways. And this is not to suggest that there won&#x27;t be in-game bonuses for those in attendance. The event will see the appearance of special wild Pokémon encounters, a commemorative in-game badge and the opportunity for the trainers to catch all seven of the Ultra Beasts appearing throughout the event.

One thing that we were not prepared for in the run up to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s release was the number of in-game bugs and glitches that would come to take the internet by storm. On top of issues with selfies, pop-ins and battle graphics, a newly discovered glitch lets you run at twice the normal speed by simply using two controllers at once (thanks, The Gamer).
Pointed out by u/hamsterhead64 on Reddit before being tried and tested by ourselves amongst many others, it is possible to really turn the on burners when running around Paldea by connecting up a second left Joy-Con (or other controller) and holding both left sticks simultaneously in the same direction.

While we were all caught up with the Wii U turning ten over the last week, there was also a big anniversary for the Wii which turned a wrinkle-inducing, hair-greying, grand total of 16 years old! Yep, that&#x27;s right, the Wii is now old enough to drive.
Once you have finished staring off into space at the sudden realisation of how fast years have gone by (pfft, we&#x27;re totally not doing that), there is some good news to be had in the shape of an anniversary video. The wonderful Felix and Zion from the Nintendo Life video team got together to chat about all things Wii and the result of their conversation is now up on YouTube.

It&#x27;s widely known that before the Nintendo Switch became official in 2016, the console was once known as the &#x27;NX&#x27;. The codename, similar to the GameCube&#x27;s &#x27;Dolpin&#x27;, the Wii&#x27;s &#x27;Revolution&#x27;, and the Wii U&#x27;s &#x27;Project Cafe&#x27;, was really all we had to go on regarding what Nintendo was cooking up in its R&amp;D department.
Now, however, thanks to the discovery of a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe prototype, the internal animated logo for the NX can now be viewed in all its glory (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer). Check it out:

At this point, we were pretty sure that there was nothing which Universal Studios Japan could do to make us want to go to Super Nintendo World more. Alas, the park is now full decorated with a festive makeover and we have once again been proved wrong.
As shared by Chris in a recent TDR Explorer video, the Nintendo theme park has been decked out in all its festive finery. We&#x27;ve got wrapping paper on the lampposts, wreaths adorning Peach&#x27;s Castle, the central Goomba and Piranha Plant stand has been transformed into a giant Christmas present. There is a lot going on.

The latest boxed charts data is in and, as expected, it&#x27;s a big win for the recently released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with both entries coming in at number one and two.
In terms of which of the two proved more popular, it seems most opted for Violet and its Legendary Pokémon Miraidon, with this version making up 52% of total sales. Meanwhile, Scarlet made up 42%, and the Dual Pack - containing both games in one handy box - entered the charts at number six, making up the remaining 6% of sales.

                              <span>The AMD EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; processor performance has been outright phenomenal. These new AMD server processors have shown stunnning performance with up to 96 cores per socket and beyond the increased core count is now up to 12 channels of DDR5-4800 memory and most significantly in the HPC space is the introduction of AVX-512 support with Zen 4. Even the 32-core high frequency Genoa performance has been dominating against Intel&#x27;s current Xeon Scalable competition. While AMD EPYC Genoa brings very impressive gains generation-over-generation and against the current Xeon Ice Lake CPUs, curiosity got the best of me for seeing how the new AMD EPYC CPUs compare to AMD&#x27;s original EPYC 1st Gen &quot;Naples&quot; flagship - the EPYC 7601 2P. Here are Genoa benchmarks showing how far the AMD server/HPC CPU performance has evolved over the past five years since Naples.</span>

Goooooood morning, friends, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that you have had a marvelous week, and that the weekend ahead brings you much joy and/or rest (delete as applicable) as you require... I might bail on my quota of Joy and take Double Rest, to be honest, such is the crazy busy month I&#x27;ve had so far. Unless its Joi from Blade Runner 2049. I&#x27;ll take Double Joi for sure. Please.
Anywhoo, thanks for stopping in for our small weekly winding. I really appreciate that y&#x27;all still making the effort to show out and keep the scene alive, week after week. It&#x27;s important to the site, and it&#x27;s very important to me. But most of all, it&#x27;s important for you, the community. We&#x27;ve been here over 200 times, and I never stop feeling the love and comradeship …</span>

                              <span>I was once a regular Counter-Strike player, but that was almost twenty years ago. What&#x27;s remarkable about Valve&#x27;s team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1? Still pretty much how they were when I was first mishandling them in the Half-Life mod. 

Which makes yesterday&#x27;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update pretty remarkable. The AWP&#x27;s magazine size has been cut in half and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long range.

                              <span>At this point, I&#x27;d consider the wacky bugs continually introduced to The Sims 4 as more of a feature than a bug. For example, a recent update turned previously placid Sims into moody, argumentative jerks who were constantly scrapping with one another. That sounds great to me, although if you disagree there&#x27;s bad news. EA Maxis say that their fix, intended to release this past week, has been delayed until early December.

Valve have announced it&#x27;ll begin on Tuesday, November 22nd and run for a week until November 29th.

After decades of whichever crap hoover my landlords dumped in a flat cupboard rather than throw away, here I am, a hoover owner. Did you know: a hoover, when pushed over a floor, will suck up dust? And keep the dust inside? Amazing. Genuinely a joy to be doing a bit of hoovering this week. Plus I bought a Shark, and Shark owners seem to get very excited when they hear someone has bought a Shark, so I guess I&#x27;m now part of a(nother) gang. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

You think Hamster has already hit all of the shmups released in the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s? Well, think again, buster, as the retro lovin&#x27; publisher has added Taito&#x27;s eye-searing shooter Metal Black to its mammoth Arcade Archives range, with the forgotten shmup now available to purchase on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1991, during Taito&#x27;s &quot;Loud &amp; Vulgar&quot; phase, (see also: Under Fire, Special Criminal Investigation), Metal Black is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shmup set against the backdrop of a damaged Earth, having fallen victim to a devastating meteor shower. In the aftermath of this event, an alien force attacks the weakened planet, leading to the surrender of humanity. However, one rogue pilot, John Ford, refuses to allow mankind to go quietly into the night. Hijacking prototype vessel &quot;CF-345 Black Fly&quot;, Ford embarks on a final bid to send the unwelcome visitors packing.
You can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Retrogaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bB4mS79R0DI
Metal Black consists of six stages of frenetic sky-fighting action, with mechanics not dissimilar to that of Irem&#x27;s R-Type and Taito&#x27;s own Darius franchise. As previously noted, Metal Black comes from an era of Taito that features somewhat ugly textures, slapdash scaling, and some brutal visual effects, which often renders the in-game action a little tough to follow. Regardless, this forgotten example does feature a pretty rad soundtrack, interesting boss designs, and a novel feature that sees the story come to one of two massively different conclusions, dependent on how the player fares on the final encounter.
Metal Black is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.

The Risk of Rain series is under new ownership. As part of the financial update from Embracer Group this week, Gearbox announced they&#x27;d acquired the IP for Risk of Rain and its sequel Risk of Rain 2.
Gearbox Publishing was the publisher of Risk of Rain 2. Now, it seems the company is taking the reins of the franchise.
&quot;After years of passionate publishing work on Risk of Rain 2, we have developed a deep love and respect for the IP,&quot; reads a statement from Gearbox on the Risk of Rain 2 account. &quot;We are eager to prove ourselves as worthy custodians by continuing to bring you world-class content and ensuring a bright future for this genre-leading franchise.&quot;

Harvestella takes place in a land where four massive crystals known as Seaslights that keep the world in balance and bless the people who call this place home. At beginning of this tale, your character awakens with a customary case of amnesia. After a quick once over by the town doctor, they bear witness to a meteor striking just outside the town of Lethe Village. Inside is a mysterious girl known as Aria. A traveler from the future? Perhaps, but her arrival marks the beginning of a journey that’ll see your hero fighting their way through dungeons in a quest to save the world.
In other words, your typical JPRG storyline, but with some farming thrown in for good measure.

                              <span>The fans are split on this one
Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is finally out, and it&#x27;s been met with, uh, mixed reviews to say the least. While some fans are simply thrilled to have a new game to sink their teeth into, others are disappointed with the game&#x27;s visuals, gameplay, and the plethora of bugs. The result is that Scarlet &amp; Violet has the lowest score on Metacritic of any mainline Pokémon game ever at a 77 -- no new gen Pokémon has scored below an 80 until now.
For years, Metacritic has been the golden standard in the games industry of the success of your game, and a bad score is enough to sink a small studio. Game Freak and Nintendo likely won&#x27;t bat an eye at the score unless it causes any sort of dip in post-launch sales, which isn&#x27;t unlikely considering how vocal fans are being with th…</span>

                              <span>Only for &quot;players ranked S+0 or higher&quot;
In the next seasonal update slated for December 1 (titled &quot;Chill&quot;), we&#x27;re getting a number of content drops in Splatoon 3, including a few new modes, weapons, and levels.
For a subset of people, the &quot;X Battles&quot; addition could be the most impactful, as it promises a higher stakes ranked mode beyond what Anarchy Battles provide.
Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s full breakdown:
&quot;Also, quick reminder that X Battles are coming in Chill Season! Players ranked S+0 or higher can get in on some action that is decidedly NOT chill. You&#x27;ll have to put your own X Power on the line to take part, but don&#x27;t worry—Anarchy Battles will still be available as well. If you do decide to take the plunge into X Battles, you&#x27;ll need to join one of two divisions sponsored by local gear brands. The Takoroka Division covers Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, while the Americas and Europe play in the Tentatek Division.&quot;

In short, X Battles are an additional thing (and currently the highest tier possible) for competitive players to jump into. But it&#x27;s very important to note that even if you&#x27;ve raised your rank to the point where you&#x27;ve unlocked X Battles, Anarchy Battles will still be available on a separate tier. So even if you end up not liking it, you can just trade back down.
I also highly suspect that X Battles are going to be getting a number of tweaks going forward, just like nearly every other mode in the game so far.

                              <span>In this exclusive behind-the-scenes interview, lead composer Yoshiya Terayama gives us an inside look at the making of Ninja Pop Star, newcomer Kimberly&#x27;s character theme in Street Fighter 6, at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Terayama, member of Capcom&#x27;s in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly&#x27;s music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly&#x27;s old-school tastes pair well with the game&#x27;s hip-hop inspirations.

The two take you through the game&#x27;s opening, showcasing what exactly you do in this Atari museum as its sole caretaker, from sweeping away dust to killing bugs and more. 
The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the museum experience in the game gives players the chance to admire high-quality screens of classic Atari game box art, game manuals, and more.

                              <span>Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

                              <span>Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s an easy one. Sometimes it&#x27;s agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you&#x27;re rolling with. While you&#x27;re at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you&#x27;re kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!</span>

A brazen move, but one where risks and privacy were carefully considered.

Sky Odyssey was a community recommendation from way, way back. Since then, I’ve had it earmarked, and I’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to get around to it. It was pitched to me as “like Pilotwings,” and I’m an absolute sucker for Pilotwings. As it turns out, it’s an apt comparison. It feels like the logical conclusion to the original SNES title’s fixed-wing biplane challenges.
I’m also something of a fan of flight sims, but have you noticed that there’s a dearth of arcade flight simulators? There are plenty of games about spitting ordinance at other aviators and many about just flying, but why am I not seeking out treasure or being encouraged to fly recklessly? A game that’s like, “there’s a massive storm; why n…</span>

The last few months of 2022 have been absolutely insane when it comes to game releases, so it’s been really telling of which games I’ve enjoyed the most based on what I’ve been drawn to playing these days. Even with newly-dropped titles like Overwatch 2 and God of War Ragnarok, I find myself going back to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II over and over again. 
I’m relatively new to the Call of Duty series, having picked it up with Cold War for the first time a few years ago with encouragement from a friend. Now CoD has basically become part of my daily routine, even if it’s just for a few rounds of Domination on my lunch break.
I know that some of my opinions about the series tend to clash with long-time fans, but I’ve actually enjoyed jumping in…</span>

Everybody&#x27;s favorite spoilers, The Taiwan Game Rating Committee, has uploaded a new listing pointing to as yet unannounced console ports of Sega&#x27;s Company of Heroes 3 —The strategy sequel is currently in development for PC, and is scheduled for launch in February 2023.
According to the new rating, (as spotted by Gematsu)  Company of Heroes 3 will be getting ported to ninth-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, though there is no suggestion these console ports will arrive alongside their PC brethren. Still, it&#x27;s a snug suggestion that console players will be joining the war effort sooner rather than later, and most assuredly in 2023.
The newest entry in the acclaimed strategy series, Company of Heroes 3 will task armchair generals with guiding their highly trained platoons through the North African theater of war. The sequel boasts a new &quot;dynamic&quot; campaign mode, that will adjust itself for multiple playthroughs with a sandbox approach to its tactical action. The &quot;Essence&quot; engine will bring levels of environmental destructibility yet to be experienced in the series, while a battalion of new units and vehicles will be sure to keep fans grinding out epic battle into the midnight hour and beyond.
We will be sure to let you know should official word of the console ports be forthcoming.
Company of Heroes 3 launches February 23 on PC via Steam.

                              <span>Y&#x27;all here for Prehistory Rogue?
Netflix has released a fun new trailer for its upcoming animated series Sonic Prime — And this particular preview has more than a hint of Multiverse Madness about it, as The Blue Blur finds himself hopping through time and space to confront wild variants of his friends, enemies, and worlds.
Over the course of the two-minute preview Sonic blasts through past and future universes, each filled with its own unique hazards and dangers. But the real meat of the clip comes from the cool array of alternate pals that appear in the mix, from cybernetic versions of Tails and Amy Rose, to special forces variants of Knuckles and Rogue, and no less than five different Dr. Robotniks. My favorite is Prehistory Rogue, who confronts our hero accompanied by your favorite, Big the Cat.

Produced by Canadian Studio WildBrain (Carmen Sandiego, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) and American producer Man of Action (Ultimate Spider-Man, Mega Man: Fully Charged), Sonic Prime promises 24 episodes of Gotta Go Fast action, featuring all of the characters both recognizable, (and, apparently, unrecognizable), from Sega&#x27;s smash-hit video game franchise. Our lad Sonic has frequently proved himself a snug fit for animated antics, and hopefully, this new show will be no different.
Sonic Prime premieres exclusively on Netflix on December 15. Back in the digital world, Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

If you&#x27;ve lived and breathed Pokémon since you were kid, it’s easy to forget just how many Pokémon games have released since 1996. Even if you don’t count any spinoff titles and lump all dual releases together (ie Red and Blue), you still have over 20 games to choose from. If you can’t count the entries in a series on your fingers and toes, there are officially too many for a new person to consider.
Fortunately, the Pokémon formula is so timeless that virtually every mainline game is a good starting point. That said, the series has plenty of peaks and valleys, and some of those peaks are truly spectacular. For those looking for the best Pokémon game to start with, or for longtime fans considering which entry to replay, here are the five best Pokém…</span>

Right on schedule, Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to all of its users gratis in the coming week — And it looks like we&#x27;re headed to a galaxy far, far away, with the arrival of Electronic Arts space flight dogfighter Star Wars Squadrons, available to download next week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nCcfJ9uEwvs
Developed by EA Motive and released on PC and consoles in the fall of 2020, Star Wars Squadrons is a dogfighter that aims to capture the majesty, splendor and visual style of the iconic movie series. Boasting an original storyline set after the events of Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Squadrons puts players in dual roles as members of both The New Republic and The Galactic Empire, both of which are tasked with the creation or destruction of a devastating new vessel known as Project Starhawk.
Star Wars Squadrons features a full story campaign as well as several multiple modes, and allows players to pilot an array of famous ships such as the X-Wing, the B-Wing, the TIE Fighter, and the TIE Bomber. Stars Wars Squadrons received moderate praise for its visuals and authenticity to the Star Wars universe, though some lauded the title&#x27;s unfulfilling &quot;work against yourself&quot; story mode, as well as a general lack of content.
Star Wars Squadrons is available to download from Epic Games Store on November 24. Until then, users can still bag themselves current freebies Evil Dead: The Game and Dark Deity.

Pokemon games have a long line of lengthy tutorials, and given how much stuff is packed into Scarlet and Violet, the new generation isn&#x27;t shying away from that formula.
Alright, so I used a stopwatch to time my copy of Pokemon Scarlet as soon as I was done creating my character, up until the point where most people would consider the tutorial fully done: and came up with one hour and 45 minutes until I had full open world access.

Here&#x27;s what the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet tutorial fully entails:

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s had to physically stop me from banging on about Black Sails will confirm that I love a bit of piracy. Games mostly don&#x27;t do it justice at all, either making &quot;piracy&quot; shorthand for &quot;mindless omnicide for no reason&quot; or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.
Buccaneers! isn&#x27;t primarily a piracy game, but they&#x27;re one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I&#x27;d call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It&#x27;s probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.

I came for the game’s resemblance to the art style from the funny books, but stayed because of its similarity to Kirkman’s excellent characterisation and shocking brutality. We are the Walking Dead, indeed. Telltale demonstrated they understood that from the start of this series.

Until then, you can play with your boomstick in co-op multiplayer schlockfest Evil Dead: The Game, and there&#x27;s tactical role-player Dark Deity too.

                              <span>At some point since I played Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered, a switch has flipped in me; I have gone from having stepped off the MCU train, content to watch it chug off into the distance with its remaining passengers, to actively wishing for its violent derailment. I&#x27;m saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.
Spider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac&#x27;s first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It&#x27;s a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it&#x27;s still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it&#x27;s shorter.

                              <span>I came, I saw, I claimed some free DLC. That’s probably what Julius Caesar would say about being given away for Sid Meier’s Civilization 6, right? Well, whatever his nibs might think about the offer, you’ll be able to pick him up for nowt from November 21st. There’s only one catch, and that’s needing to link your 2K account on Steam or the Epic Games Store. Have a watch of the trailer below to see what ol’ leaf-ears has to offer your Romans.

                              <span>For somehow the second time in my life, I recently found myself in deeply urgent need of a 4K gaming monitor. An RTX 4090 review deadline was rapidly approaching, any suitably UHD-specced loaner monitors I could use for testing had been sent back, and my backup – a nasty little 60Hz screen – wasn’t going to cut it. Unwilling to prostrate myself for another loan model and reluctant to burn such a vast hole in RPS’s expenses budget, I elected for the fastest, easiest option of just buying one myself.

In particular, Zarya’s particle barrier duration has been reduced, so you should have an easier team taking her on in future. Blizzard announced there’d be a delay to the balance adjustment update earlier this week, which had been scheduled for November 15th.

Naka is alleged to have bought around 10,000 shares in Dragon Quest Tact developers Aiming back in 2020 for ¥2.8 million (£16,800). At that point, Naka was still working with Square Enix on Balan Wonderworld.

It’s the first time we’ve got anything close to a glimpse of the remake, still in its early prototyping stage, could look like. The seven slices of concept art were shown as part of Splinter Cell’s 20th anniversary.

That drops it £73, a terrific deal on a PSU that can handle anything up to (and including) an RTX 4090. We actually covered this power supply last month, when I was surprised to learn it had dropped to £90 after weeks of costing more than £100 in the crypto-boom era. Now it&#x27;s even cheaper, and that makes our recommendation stronger than ever.

                              <span>Last week when launching the AMD EPYC 9004 &quot;Genoa&quot; processors, AMD released AOCC 4.0 as the newest version of their optimizing C/C++ compiler that now supports their Zen 4 micro-architecture. Last week I ran some initial AOCC 4.0 benchmarks and this LLVM/Clang downstream was looking rather favorable in relation to upstream LLVM/Clang, while since then I&#x27;ve been able to conduct more thorough benchmarks across a wide variety of C/C++ open-source workloads. Here is that more extensive round of AOCC 4.0 benchmarking against the open-source LLVM/Clang and AOCC compilers.</span>

                              <span>At a glance, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader looks like so many other turn-based games set in the 40K universe. Except, this isn&#x27;t turn-based strategy, but a proper CRPG from the makers of the recent, well-liked Pathfinder games. Its first gameplay trailer awaits below.

Aska&#x27;s twist is that your settlement is also populated by a cadre of NPCs who you must protect and direct. There&#x27;s an announcement trailer below ahead of closed alpha testing to begin at the end of the month.

                              <span>Shadows Of Doubt invites skepticism. It&#x27;s an open world mystery game set in a city in which every resident is simulated with daily schedules and routines, and it&#x27;s developed largely by a single person. Shadows Of Doubt has also fought my skepticism so far with playable demos and, now, a new official trailer. It sure looks like it&#x27;s doing the thing.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they&#x27;re working on during tonight&#x27;s PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It&#x27;s called Jumplight Odyssey (or &quot;J-Lo&quot; for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it&#x27;s a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. 
In it, you play as Princess Euphora, who&#x27;s on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It&#x27;s not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I&#x27;ve seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.

                              <span>Ever had a real-life experience where you’re something like 90% sure you’re actually in a horror film? Answers in the comments, please. Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. &#x27;Aha!&#x27; I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.
For those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.

                              <span>Look, we can all agree that Spore is not quite the game it could have been. In terms of the different eras that you coach your little creature species through, the game peaks early on in the cell stage. After that, everything goes a little downhill. But I&#x27;ll tell you what: I&#x27;ve never, ever been so excited for a game to release, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will again. I was losing sleep over it. And there&#x27;s one simple reason: the Creature Creator.

                              <span>I’m always amazed by the Minecraft building community. We’ve seen the likes of Tolkien’s Middle-earth, Breath Of The Wild, Disneyland, Game of Thrones&#x27; Westeros, and the Star Wars universe all built block by block - and that’s only a short list of what you can find online. The creations you can find are honestly kind of amazing, and Minecraft builders are constantly putting out new masterpieces for fellow Minecrafters and non-crafters to oggle at all year round.

                              <span>If you’re going to go on the hunt for giant monsters then you&#x27;ll need some serious technology to back you up. Upcoming hunting game Wild Hearts is packing plenty of what devs Omega Force are calling Karakuri, the magical flat-pack wooden kit the game’s warriors use to battle the various beasties in their fantasy take on medieval Japan. You can get a glimpse of some of the Karakuri battles that Wild Hearts contains in the trailer below, including a rather awesome looking monocycle and a furious monkey with a very nasty skin condition.

That&#x27;s the premise of The Banished Vault, an upcoming strategy game announced this week. You&#x27;ll flee from solar system to solar system in a mobile monastery megacity, trying desperately to scavenge what you can before an all-annihilating pursuer catches up. The Banished Vault is the first game on the new indie publishing label of Bithell Games, but more interesting to me is that it&#x27;s coming from the designer of Sun Dogs.

                              <span>There’s some bad news for anyone who wants to prove themselves on the battlefield now Season 1 of multiplayer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has begun, I’m afraid. Treyarch Studios have tweeted to announce that the Call Of Duty League Moshpit playlist mode is delayed due to some recently discovered issues. The Black Ops Cold War devs did say it would only be a “slight delay”, though, and that they’d provide an update on when the mode would be active as soon as they could.

But not to worry, because The Electronic Wireless Show podcast has collected some of the best games for having a virtual stare, so you can do it from the comfort of your own home.
This does necessitate us defining wistful first, although honestly I think I nail it out of the gate. Nate also provides this week&#x27;s Cavern Of Lies mini-game, and a) he nearly beats me but b) he&#x27;d never heard of Thomas Was Alone, which is pretty funny.

Subaquatic sim Surviving The Abyss is diving straight into the human genepool when it enters early access on Steam on January 17th, though. The game’s coming from Rocket Flair Studios under the Paradox Arc label launched back in August.

To add insult to injury, NetEase’s president Simon Zhu has taken to LinkedIn to blame “a jerk” for the deal’s collapse.

                              <span>A short teaser for the next horror game in Supermassive’s The Dark Pictures Anthology series has emerged on YouTube. Called Directive 8020, it seems like this one is going full sci-fi and heading all the way into outer space, Event Horizon style. The teaser video seems to have been taken from the end of an advance copy of its predecessor The Devil In Me, which is released tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled for our review. Supermassive will likely follow up with an official teaser after The Devil In Me&#x27;s out. You can watch the leaked teaser below, if you’re not spooked by the possibility of spoilers.

Bethesda tweeted their statement last night, calling Gordon’s lengthy post explaining his experience working on Doom Eternal’s soundtrack &quot;a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship”.

                              <span>Little or large? That&#x27;s the choice you&#x27;ll have to make between these two Dell monitor deals at Dell&#x27;s US outlet, with Black Friday prices on a 24-in 1080p 240Hz monitor ideal for competitive gaming or a 32-in 4K 144Hz model with HDMI 2.1 that would suit a high-end gaming PC, PS5 or Series X. Both are incredibly good value after today&#x27;s discounts, and well worth taking a look at if you&#x27;re in the market for a monitor upgrade!

From inside Teams, you can now play procrastination classics like Solitaire and Minesweeper as well as party games meant for oodles of people. You can even play co-op Minesweeper. And hey, if it happens inside Teams, no one can deny it&#x27;s work. If anything, you&#x27;re engaging with the business experience even harder.

                              <span>As Pokémon Scarlet and Violet reviews hit the internet one day before the twin games are released, the overriding message has a grim tone: the Switch just can’t handle the game.

                              <span>Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too. 
&quot;Set across three shattered versions of the game&#x27;s world, Trinity Fusion casts players in the role of the Hitchhiker, a cross-dim…</span>

                              <span>Update, 11/17/2022:
Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below: 


As you can see, Directive 8020 will be the series&#x27; first forray into sci-fi horror, and it seems …</span>

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet hit store shelves and the Switch eShop tomorrow. Chances are, you&#x27;re seeing some reviews pop up right about now. While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

                              <span>Mechanical keyboards are brilliant. If you agree, you probably have one on your desk right now - and we have just the deal for you. SteelSeries&#x27; PrismCaps are an awesome upgrade over your stock keycaps, offering high-quality PBT construction, backlit legends and a beautiful two-tone &#x27;pudding cup&#x27; design that looks great, especially with an RGB keyboard. 
Normally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they&#x27;ll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like multiplayer games would be better if other players were less abusive? Ubisoft and Riot Games are looking into training artificial intelligence to tackle bad behaviours within in-game chat, a research collaboration they’re calling Zero Harm In Comms. Ahead of their announcement today, I put some questions to Ubisoft La Forge’s executive director Yves Jacquier and Riot’s head of technology research Wesley Kerr to get some more insight on the joint project, and ask them exactly how their proposal will work.

I understand why you made this decision, but I do not have to agree. This might become part of my own backstory.

Nestling in among all the talk of Mother Crystals and summons is a comment from writer Kazutoyo Maehiro that players will get to control another character than just our boy Clive. It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

Now that Night City is playable, it&#x27;s one of the most transportive video game cities out there, where cold calls from unknown numbers play into the fantasy of transforming from an upstart to a big shot who&#x27;s name travels along its neon-lit back alleys.

                              <span>So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

                              <span>One thing that I don&#x27;t really talk about is how I am in fact a horrible little gremlin. I&#x27;ve never really graduated from storing my clothes on the floor like I did when I was 16 (every 12 weeks or so I tidy them all away and then start the process again). It is cold, so I have a pink blanket that is my work chair blanket, which I have had for at least five years and I cannot remember washing. I store things using a cunning system of my own devising i.e. the cellotape has been behind the left monitor on my desk for months, so by the transitive property that is now Where The Cellotape Goes. If I put the cellotape somewhere more logical, like in a drawer for keeping things like cellotape, then I would forget where the cellotape is. 
The area in and around my desk is a nonsensical melange of things, a place that would probably deal you +12 psychological damage if you approached without the necessary preparation. But after playing A Little To The Left I can rebrand my desk as being a deliberate series of whimsical organising puzzles.

                              <span>Two years ago I asked whether anyone had played retro FPS Chasm: The Rift and admitted that I’d never made it past the first level because I was roughly eight years old at the time, and it terrified me. Twenty years later I’ve returned to its re-release - and beaten the first level! And in the process, I’ve developed a particular appreciation for the old-school boomer shooter and its interesting quirks.

                              <span>In the Tom Waits song The Piano Has Been Drinking, the gravel-voiced pianist imitates a pissed-up lounge singer, slurring his way through nonsense lyrics, pounding on the keyboard, and occasionally hitting all of the wrong notes. Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

                              <span>A whole bunch of classic Civilization leaders are coming back for Civilization 6’s upcoming Leader Pass, devs Firaxis have confirmed. You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series. The Leader Pass’ existence was leaked by accident last week when promo art for the DLC appeared on the mobile version of the Civ website, before it was removed.

Normally you&#x27;re looking at around $50 to $150 for the case itself, with a further $70 to $100 for a matching SFX power supply, but today there&#x27;s an excellent deal at Amazon US that offers a small form factor case and a 700W PSU for just $130 - after a sizeable $120 discount. 
The case is the HYTE Revolt 3, and it&#x27;s attracted rave reviews for its easy build qualities, great thermals and beautiful design, making it an easy recommendation at this discounted price.

                              <span>Blizzard have postponed the release of a patch for Overwatch 2 so they can fix an undisclosed “critical issue” with the game. The patch had been scheduled for November 15th, and is meant to include hero balance adjustments for Zarya, Genji, Sombra, Kiriko, and D.va. The mid-season update should also see Mei return to the hero shooter after her two-week stint on the bench, Blizzard’s statement said, following issues with her icewall ability last month. You can now expect the patch to arrive tomorrow, November 17th, at 7pm GMT / 9pm CET / 11am PST. Not too long to wait, then.

                              <span>Newly announced MMO shooter Project LLL is doing several unusual things. For one, it&#x27;s set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.

Along with Cloudflare and the .to registry, hosting provider Zenlayer is also asked to hand over data. Meanwhile, the ACE coalition&#x27;s reach continues to expand.

                              <span>In August, an Indian court ordered domain registrars including NameCheap, Tucows, Dynadot, and Sarek Oy to disable several pirate site domains. They failed to comply so the judge has just ordered two government agencies to take immediate action. Among other things, they must determine if the domain companies should even be allowed to do business in India.

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
&quot;New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we&#x27;d give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2,&quot; a blog post about the new season reads. &quot;Hailing from planet Mars and sent to destroy Earth with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, M…</span>

                              <span>Football has been banned and only one person can save it. No, it&#x27;s not the self-important fantasy Cristiano Ronaldo dreams every night, it&#x27;s the setup for adventure RPG Soccer Story. You need to travel around its colourful, Nintendo-inspired world, cajole people into kicking balls once more, and then defeat them on the pitch. Soccer Story also now has a release date: November 29th.

                              <span>If you have a Game Pass subscription, I don&#x27;t see why you would buy a game between now and the end of the year. Earlier this month, Football Manager 2023 came to the service, a game so all-consuming it barely leaves time to sleep. Now Microsoft have announced the remaining games to arrive in November, and as expected it includes the year&#x27;s remaining big release, co-op shooter Warhammer 40K: Darktide, as well as several indie darlings.

                              <span>Like so many games buried deep within my Steam library, I am unsure when I bought Painkiller: Black Edition or my exact reasons for doing so. I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

                              <span>Season 1 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus is over, and Season 2 has begun today with an update that adds more reward tiers to the battle pass. There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.

                              <span>Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it&#x27;s clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it&#x27;s a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

I&#x27;ve turned to Brotato, a game whose demo I enjoyed in the Steam Next Fest, and which launched into early access in September. I say with great affection: it feels (and looks) like it could have been a Flash game on Newgrounds. Plus it&#x27;s only £4.

                              <span>Jumpship are only just releasing their first game today, alien invasion dad-venture Somerville, but they’ve been snapped up by publishers Thunderful. The small studio based in Guildford will still be free to pursue its own creative projects, continuing to focus on story-driven games such as Somerville. Co-founder of Jumpship and former CEO of Playdead Dino Patti will become Thunderful’s Strategic Advisor, but remains with the studio.

                              <span>We are witnessing a three-horse race to the death of Twitter. Will Twitter&#x27;s technical infrastructure collapse after the staff who know how to maintain it are fired, leaving the would-be God Emperor of mankind rotting upon his failing Cobalt Throne? Will Twitter shut down due to financial collapse? Will people simply leave Twitter? All I know is, I&#x27;ll miss the Twitter bots which go down to collateral damage, the automated machines which tirelessly post art, poetry, jokes, stories, and probably dog photos. Here are some of my favourites!

Some Call Of Duty players looking forward to getting their itchy trigger fingers on the free-to-play battle royale have been struggling to sort out their preloads, though. This confusion echoes what happened with Modern Warfare 2019 when Warzone 1.0 launched back in 2020. If you’re bemused by the current preload sitch then watch the Warzone 2.0 launch trailer below, and let Freebird chill you out.

A store page for the Oklahoma expansion has popped up on Steam, although there hasn’t been an official announcement just yet. That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that&#x27;s out of the way.

DokeV.Club report that Pearl Abyss CEO Heo Jin-young acknowledged that the game would overshoot 2023 during the company’s earnings conference call last week. Pearl Abyss also delayed their upcoming action adventure Crimson Desert.

We can expect them to arrive in Overwatch 2 when Season 3 of the game begins in early February 2023.

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.
Somerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.

                              <span>A man who used hacked Netflix credentials to obtain content before uploading it to a torrent site has been sentenced in Denmark. The 34-year-old DanishBytes user was a staff member for two months, offering tech support to the site&#x27;s users. The stolen credentials allowed him to obtain content from legal streaming services using other people&#x27;s accounts.

New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more.

&quot;This Omega-Level Threat is a new endgame challenge headlined by a climactic confrontation with the deranged genius to end the danger once and for all,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The Lab is a challenging AIM base that players will navigate before facing off one last time against MODOK in a grand multiplayer fight.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…</span>

                              <span>MSI&#x27;s RX 6650 XT is a capable graphics card for 1440p gaming, and it&#x27;s down from £380 to £299.99 at Overclockers after a healthy discount. 
It also comes with AMD&#x27;s Raise the Game Bundle, which includes copies of two upcoming games: Dead Island 2 and The Callisto Protocol (confusingly titled &#x27;The Callisto Project&#x27; by a potentially short-sighted Overclockers staffer). This is a pretty solid deal for three hundred of your Great British Pounds, especially as GTX 16-series cards were selling for this much recently and offer far worse performance.

                              <span>It takes a very special game to give you so much to learn, so many ways to do everything, that even after 1000 hours of playtime you still feel like a beginner. Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it&#x27;s mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game&#x27;s scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

                              <span>I shouldn&#x27;t enjoy Sonic Frontiers as much as I do, but I do? The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it&#x27;s a lot of fun when you&#x27;re mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It&#x27;s a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you&#x27;d like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can&#x27;t get any better than this.

The update will also bring a number of other visual and technical improvements, as well as integrate a number of mods into the fantasy RPG, originally released in 2015. Gameplay from the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 is due to be shown off in a REDstreams event on Twitch next week, along with some new stuff for the game based on Netflix’s version of Geralt Of Rivia’s adventures.

The Easter egg was introduced along with the game’s 40th Anniversary update, which went live on Friday. Activating the secret games will let you play them in your aircraft’s cockpit, using the keys on the screen to control the plane-within-a-plane.

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn&#x27;t call him &quot;Boy!&quot;, and also he won&#x27;t shut up under any circumstances.

To gear players up ahead of time, some more details about one of the game’s four classes have been revealed in a new gameplay video.

Modder PureDark is working together with a small team on the unofficial plugin, called Skyrim-Upscaler, and it should help bump up those frame rates somewhat. It&#x27;s available to download now from Github if you want to give it a go yourself, but there’s no plan to release the plugin publicly until the modders sort out VR compatibility.

                              <span>The future has arrived in Monkey Moon&#x27;s new narrative management game, and you can see it all the next time you go and fill up your car. At EyeLife&#x27;s Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You&#x27;ll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you&#x27;re not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They&#x27;ve got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you&#x27;re short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don&#x27;t forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I&#x27;ve only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This past weekend was particularly fruitful, so enjoy a bumper-sized edition of Screenshot Saturday Mondays with all manner of cute frogs, stylish ultraviolence, dinosaurs cooking pizza, giant beasts to climb, and chill landscapes to roam.

                              <span>The end of another Fortnite map is nigh, with Chapter 3 of the free-to-play battle royale drawing to a surprisingly early close next month. The change will coincide with the end of Season 4 in an event called Fracture, teased by devs Epic Games at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series held over the weekend. Fracture kicks off on December 3rd at 9pm GMT / 1pm PST.

                              <span>Survival city-builders put the fear of God in me. There’s just something about managing an entire civilisation of people that just shreds my nerves. Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

I feel that&#x27;s a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive&#x27;s suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.

Get the Crucial BX500 1TB for £56 (RRP £74)

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

                              <span>Brazil says blocking measures to tackle the rise of pirate IPTV services and devices are coming soon. In the meantime, a new system of fines will apply to suppliers and users alike. The government has other plans which appear to render all TV boxes illegal by default, pending official approval. And if anyone modifies an approved device or &quot;uses it incorrectly&quot;, that&#x27;s an offense too.

                              <span>A federal court in Seattle has dismissed the hacking and DMCA circumvention claims filed by AimJunkies against game developer Bungie. The cheat seller filed the claim in a retaliatory move after it was sued for copyright infringement relating to Destiny 2 hacks. The order is a clear win for Bungie, but the legal dispute is not over yet.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
&quot;Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday,&quot; Pershing writes. &quot;He&#x27;s been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend.&quot;

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series&#x27; premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.</span>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.
First, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…</span>

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

                              <span>As Capcom readies the next mainline entry of its beloved fighting franchise, it&#x27;s taking the fight to a new arena: the cover of Game Informer. That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

                              <span>A wild Pokémon trailer appeared! This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
