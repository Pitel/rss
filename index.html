Welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl, folks!
Last week, we took a look at Crash Nitro Kart for the GameCube, a sequel to Crash Team Racing that never quite managed to step out of its predecessor&#x27;s shadow.

This information comes from &quot;a new leak of iQue emails not too long ago&quot; according to Yakumono&#x27;s Blog, run by dataminer (and Nintendo Life user) LuigiBlood.

Ahead of the launch of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for Switch next week, some players have supposedly already &quot;got their hands on&quot; physical copies of the game.
This was highlighted by &#x27;Nintendeal&#x27; on social media, which also notes how pre-orders for the game have now sold out at select locations in the US. In the photos below, you can see the front and back of the game box:

Last week, accessory maker Genki announced it would be showcasing &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; accessories at CES 2025 and it&#x27;s now delivered on this promise.
These new products are reportedly being shown &quot;behind closed doors&quot; and the German outlet Netzwelt has now shared some photos online. Apart from a look at a docking station with Joy-Con controllers attached, there&#x27;s also a &quot;Switch 2 replica&quot; model on display.

                              <span>The Golden Tide event in Fisch has brought some interesting content for players to enjoy, and you can catch the Eternal Frostwhale to add to your Bestiary.


But planning to catch this creature and actually managing to land it will be two different things. Based on player accounts on the official Discord server, the Eternal Frostwhale is extremely elusive and rarely spawns at any given location.

                              <span>Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It&#x27;s about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It&#x27;s MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn&#x27;t heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.

                              <span>Minecraft is the best PC game, according to me and the RPS staff who dare not cross me. I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.

How many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I&#x27;m not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.

I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll fall over, but weirdly I&#x27;m not so worried about, I dunno, hitting my head, as I am wanging my elbow and getting that jolt of fuzzy numbness all the way down my arm. At least if I hit my head I wouldn&#x27;t be around to feel the aftermath.
For all you fellows who are equally afeared of the outside world, let&#x27;s all agree to stay indoors and play some excellent games. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Marvel Rivals is rapidly becoming one of the most popular multiplayer video games running right now, and it&#x27;s just reached a massive milestone on Steam. For a few hours, Marvel Rivals was the most-played game on Steam, outperforming some top-tier competitors and proving its staying power within the multiplayer scene.


Marvel Rivals&#x27; Season 1 launch turned it into the most-played game on Steam

When Marvel Rivals launched in December last year, it instantly became one of the most popular games on Steam. The game amassed over 2,000,000 players on Steam within hours of its release, shattering expectations. However, some people remained unconvinced the game&#x27;s time in the spotlight would last long. Some onlookers, including former Blizzard head Mike Ybarra, downplayed the game&#x27;s success, predicting its post-launch hype would fizzle out fast. 


Luckily for fans, Marvel Rivals&#x27; harshest critics got a huge reality check when Season 1 dropped on January 10, 2025. According to SteamDB, Marvel Rivals racked up 644,269 concurrent players in the hours after Season 1 went live, breaking its previous all-time peak player count and sending it flying to the top of Steam&#x27;s most-played game chart.


While Marvel Rivals would lose its spot at the top of the pyramid within a few hours, it&#x27;s impossible to deny how impressive that accomplishment is. In the short time it was the most-played game on Steam, Marvel Rivals outperformed some stiff competition. This included Path of Exile 2, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2, all of which have become mainstays on Steam&#x27;s most-played lists.


With Season 1 in full swing, the odds of Marvel Rivals&#x27; player count getting swelled by word-of-mouth are pretty high. If that happens, the little hero shooter that could might end up topping Steam&#x27;s most-played list soon.

                              <span>PlayStation 2 is often known as one of the best consoles of all time, as it introduced many iconic games that are still widely popular today. After all these years, it still holds up as my favorite console, and I even have a PS2 keychain on my lanyard to prove it.


The only problem is how difficult it can be to play these classic entries now that we&#x27;ve entered the modern age of the PlayStation 5. Fortunately, the PlayStation Plus&#x27; Classic Catalog and remasters allow us to experience nostalgia again. So, without further ado, here are the best PS2 games you can play on the PS5.

                              <span>American Primeval has hit Netflix, and in the two days since its release, it has already become a hit. The American Frontier setting, coupled with the characters created for the show, have pulled people in around the globe. 


If you’ve binged all six episodes and are itching for more tales from the American Frontier, there are a lot of options available to you, including TV and movies alike. However, perhaps the best way to lose yourself in tales from the Midwest is through books, and there are a lot of tales to choose from. 


If you want something to read, here are ten of the best books you can pick up that will provide the same haunting feeling as American Primeval. There’s a mixture of fact and fiction here, and even some entries that bridge the gap between both.

                              <span>The recent critical and commercial success of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has cemented this collection of live action films based on Sega&#x27;s iconic mascot as one of the best video game adaptations (and best movie trilogies) in the industry. As a result of their huge cultural impact, fans all around the world have fallen in love with its colorful cast of characters.


Whether they&#x27;re humans portrayed by famous actors or anthropomorphic animals voiced by talented voice actors; whether they are new incarnations of iconic figures from the original video games or they were specifically created for the movies, the characters in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trilogy are as likable as they&#x27;re well-written. The only question is: Who are the absolute best ones in the series? (so far...)

                              <span>As part of the selection of gifts that I purchased for my fiancé to open on Christmas morning 2024, I chose a special Tamagotchi-style Kingdom Hearts virtual pet. It’s one of his favorite games, and it was something cute to stuff into his stocking, but it got me feeling nostalgic about my own experience with Tamagotchis. 


Like an idiot, I voiced this nostalgic longing and my fiancé, being as wonderful as he is, immediately ordered me a new one and I actually, for a brief time, felt excited at the prospect of raising this pixel pet. Then it arrived, I named it &quot;Pixy&quot; as it started beeping, and it only managed to reach the ripe old age of two before it inexplicably died after being fed nothing but cake because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.

Worryingly, this prediction has come true in the form of the PlayerScope plugin. 


FFXIV is strictly against any use of plugins or mods. Anyone caught using any type of game-changing software is permanently banned, which should be enough to put anybody off. However, this hasn’t stopped people from creating or using mods, and the latest doing the rounds is particularly troublesome, and it seems to have been enabled by changes made by Square Enix themselves and were warned of at the time.

                              <span>The Great Ninja War event has arrived in Anime Last Stand, and it has added several new characters to the roster.


You can obtain these units from the event banner, and that&#x27;s not all. These units also have powerful evolutions, which would buff their abilities and stats. Let&#x27;s take a look at how to obtain the new units and how you can evolve them.


All Great Ninja War units in Anime Last Stand

                              <span>It’s hard to believe that we’ve crossed over into 2025, and it’s now officially closer to 2030 than 2020, but here we are. MMOs are still dominating the gaming space, and they’re an incredible way to meet friends, have fun, and work towards goals without too much pressure. 


There are a lot of MMOs out there, and it can be hard to decipher which ones are still worth playing. New titles are released all the time, and they either quickly build up a solid player base or they fade into obscurity with a few cult followers. Of course, MMOs, by definition, are “massively multiplayer”, so player numbers definitely count when it comes to deciding what to play. 


Here are 10 MMOs that are worth playing in 2025.

                              <span>The Golden Tides (Tides of Gold) update has introduced a few limited species you can find in Fisch, and doing so will be necessary if you want to 100% your Bestiary.


The latest update has introduced some exciting content for the fans to grind over the weekend, which includes the Dr. Glimmerfin quest, which will get you an exclusive boat and a new rod. But that&#x27;s not all, as you can add five new species to your collection.


All Fisch Golden Tide Bestiary species


Let&#x27;s first take a look at the five new species that are part of Bestiary.


Species
Type
Preferred Bait




Tidal Pike
Limited
Night Shrimp


Confetti Shark
Limited
Deep Coral


Eternal Frostwhale
Limited
Shark Head


Hourglass Bass 
Limited
Aurora Bait


Countdown Perch
Limited
Weird Algae






You can catch all five species any time of the day, which makes it relatively easy as far as the day/night cycle is concerned. But they will only spawn in the Golden Tide Pool and won&#x27;t be available anywhere else.


Golden Tide Pool location in Fisch


Unfortunately, the Golden Tide Pool doesn&#x27;t have a fixed location and spawns randomly. However, you can watch out for a few clues to find it after the pool spawns on your server. First, there will be a server-wide notification, which will state that the Golden Tide Pool has started.


While the exact location won&#x27;t be announced, you can find it by tracking a bright orange marker. Just travel to the marker, and you&#x27;ll be able to catch all five limited species.


If you haven&#x27;t figured out by their limited nature already, these species won&#x27;t be spawning indefinitely. They are likely going to be available until January 18th, when the next update is expected to drop. Make sure to complete the Mr. Glimmerfin quest as well if you&#x27;re looking for a new ride and rod in Fisch.

Steam is well known for its periodical sales and events, but they can sometimes sneak up on you without any warning if you’re not careful. 


These special events on Steam can be split into three distinct types:



Seasonal sales: A period during which any game could become available at a discounted price.


Fests: Themed sales events during which games of a certain type are available at a discounted price.


Next Fest: Focuses on games that are not yet released, with a lot of demos becoming available to play and opportunities to connect with developers.



These events usually last for seven days each, with many occurring back to back with no break…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re someone looking to expand your roster in Anime Reborn, Aizen (Aizon) can be a worthy shot.


The character by itself is pretty strong, but you can improve its potential with the help of evolutions. To evolve him, you&#x27;ll need something called Spiritual Cores. Before that, let&#x27;s find out how you can obtain him inside the game.


How to get Aizen (Aizon) in Anime Reborn


Aizon (as Aizen is called in the game) can be obtained from the New Year&#x27;s Crates, but you&#x27;ll have to hope to get really lucky. The odds of getting him is a mere 0.25%, as he is a Secret Unit. In fact, the total odds of obtaining a Secret Unit from the chest is only 0.5%.


You can open the chests at the World Collision Adventure. Just talk with Cid NPC by using the Event button. To open the chests, you&#x27;ll need 250 New Year Coins, which in turn can be earned by completing the Bingo quests. You can get additional New Year Coins by using codes and finishing the World Collision event stage.




How to evolve Aizen (Aizon) in Anime Reborn


As good as Aizon is in his base version, you&#x27;ll want to evolve him as soon as possible. This can be done with the help of a Spiritual Core, which can also be obtained from the World Collision Adventure Stage. There&#x27;s a 5% chance for it to drop once you complete the stage. Naturally, it could take you several tries before you can find a Spiritual Core.


Even if you aren&#x27;t lucky with your drops, you can end up finding the new exclusive Cid. You can also get the material required to evolve Cid. Bottom line: make sure to keep trying your luck because Aizon is definitely worth the evolution. At worst, you&#x27;ll still find a lot of valuable resources that will help to power up other characters from your collection.

Named Sabur, this is certainly one of the best characters you can currently obtain inside the game. If you think that her base version is strong, then you&#x27;re surely going to love the evolved form. The evolved form buffs all the base stats and unlocks better abilities as well.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how to obtain Sabur to add her to your collection.


How to get Saber (Sabur) in Anime Reborn


To get Saber or Sabur, you won&#x27;t have to rely on any banners. She can be obtained by completing the Winter Mayhem stages and obtaining the Winter Present (Mythic) reward. However, you&#x27;ll still have to rely heavily on your luck, as you have onl…</span>

But look on the bright side: in 2025, there are so many games that are turning thirty years old. It&#x27;s time for them to leave home, find a partner, and start a family!


Jokes aside, while many of those games are still celebrated today, there are many others that seem to have been somewhat forgotten by critics and audiences alike. Which ones might still be worth your time and money? Here are our best picks from the best year in the mid-90s.

                              <span>The Dr. Glimmerfin quest is now available in Fisch as part of the Golden Tides update, and you can complete it quite easily by finding four Algae.


While the job sounds easy to complete, you&#x27;ll have to go to the correct location for starters. Then, you&#x27;ll have to get your equipment setup right to improve your chances of getting the item. Once you get these things added to your inventory, you&#x27;ll be able to get some amazing rewards.


All Algae Sample locations in Fisch (Dr. Glimmerfin quest)


For starters, go to the scientist located at Moosewood. Once you start the quest, you&#x27;ll have to collect four Algae samples. These samples can be found in the Algae Pools, which spawn randomly. You&#x27;ll find a pointer indicating them when one has spawned for you to go and find your samples.

As the debut of Season 1 saw Marvel Rivals adopt asset hash checking, all of the mods below no longer work.




The Marvel Rivals modding scene has quickly become known for its novel and out-there crossovers, letting players bring beloved characters like GTA&#x27;s CJ and real-life celebrities like Ariana Grande into the game. But as you can expect, not all mods will have the same quality.


Here are the 10 best Marvel Rivals mods. But before you continue, remember that using mods might open you up to a possible ban in the game, so do so at your own risk. You can check out more about this in our Can you get banned for using mods in Marvel Rivals piece.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an argument to be had that all video games are survival games in many respects. Despite the gun-blasting, demon-killing chaos of the likes of Doom 2, you&#x27;re still trying to survive in a pixelated world run amok with hellish antagonists. But what if you were to turn the game into something that&#x27;s more in-line with the survival genre?


That&#x27;s what ModDB user budwieser (yes, it&#x27;s really spelled that way) is doing, at least. Taking heavy inspiration from the STALKER series, &quot;Heart of U.A.C.&quot; is an upcoming mod for Doom 2 that takes you away from hell and pits you against the Zone.

The Zone, in this case, has invaded the Union Aerospace Corporation – the Mars-based conglomerate where much of Doom takes place. The mod is described thus:

How to become a Guard in Shrimp Game


There are two ways to become a guard in Shrimp Game:



Spend ₩2,500,000 in-game cash for a one-time use pass.


Spend 849 Robux for infinite guard uses.



Once you enter your Shrimp Game lobby, press the guard button on the right side of your screen and select Guard as your role. If you don&#x27;t have a guard pass, your screen will change to the Guard Pass menu, showing the prices and perks of becoming one. From here, you can buy a one-time pass or spend Robux to become a guard whenever you wish.

Total number of registered .to domains is just 26,000, available from a website that has barely changed in over 25 years.

                              <span>Před dvanácti lety, ve svých šestadvaceti letech, navždy odešel Aaron Swartz, výjimečný americký hacker (programátor), spisovatel, archivář, politický organizátor a internetový aktivista. Aaron Swartz založil Demand Progress, spolupracoval na projektech Open Library, Internet Archive a Reddit. Ve svých čtrnácti se podílel na specifikaci RSS 1.0. Vytvořil webový framework web.py, pracoval na tor2web a rozšíření HTTPS Everywhere pro Chrome. Stál u zrodu licence Creative Commons. Aaronovi Swartzovi hrozilo 35 let vězení a pokuta milion dolarů za hromadné stahování vědeckých článků z webu JSTOR. Dle přátel i vlastních výpovědí několik posledních let trpěl depresemi. V pátek 11. ledna 2013 ukončil svůj život oběšením.</span>

A lot has changed in video gaming since Switch launched in 2017. Beyond all Nintendo&#x27;s handheld hybrid switching, we now live in a world where a Nintendo game on mobile is a fairly normal occurrence and both Microsoft and Sony publish games on Nintendo&#x27;s console. Crazy.
As we await official word on the next generation of Nintendo hardware, it&#x27;s got us thinking back on the current cycle and the games that defined the era for Switch owners.

It seems funny to think back on it now, but during the early days of Resident Evil – when decomposing zombies were the top dog and Raccoon City was everybody&#x27;s favourite apocalyptic holiday destination – the idea that the franchise would find itself in the rural outskirts of Europe in which you fight a child-like evil castellan seemed utterly absurd.

While nothing has been finalised just yet, speaking to Collider earlier this month - the Sonic 3 movie writers Josh Miller and Pat Casey mentioned how Sonic and the gang could potentially go beyond Earth in future outings, to all sorts of &quot;fantastical zones&quot; and worlds.

The big news was &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;. No, we still don&#x27;t know anything about it officially, but accessory manufacturer Genki took to this year&#x27;s CES with a &quot;replica&quot; model that appears to be the real deal. The company went on to share information about the model&#x27;s Joy-Con and dock, but then took it all back, stating that the whole thing was based on leaks in the first place. Hmm.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has been nominated for another award. This time it&#x27;s up for &#x27;Adventure game of the year&#x27; at the 28th annual DICE Awards.
The other nominees include 1000xRESIST, Animal Well, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. That&#x27;s some tough competition, but there&#x27;s always a chance it could take out the top spot.

Amazon customers have been receiving emails recently, confirming the cancellation of this item &quot;due to a lack of availability&quot; and providing refunds. A user on the Metroid subreddit, who ordered the title in 2017 (alongside the original announcement), shared the message they received:

What in the world is this, and how do you do it? We have the answers below.


How to trigger Recursive Destruction in Marvel Rivals


To trigger Recursive Destruction in Marvel Rivals, you need first to be playing on the new Empire of the Eternal Night: Midtown map. It’s a Convoy game mode where you need to push and escort the objective to the end. As a defender, you must prevent attackers from getting that far.


During any phase, use your Chrono Vision. It tells you what things are destructible in the playing field’s environment. You’ll typically see yellow items being destructible, but for the “Recursive Destruction” aspec…</span>

                              <span>With over five billion visits and hundreds of thousands of daily players, Dress to Impress is one of the most successful games on Roblox. And much like other games on the platform, it’s got its fair share of items you can purchase with Robux. 


One of these options is the coveted VIP status, which gets you a golden title above your avatar and other sought-after benefits. If you’re just jumping into the game, you might be wondering if the VIP status is worth it. We’re here to give you all the details.


How much does VIP cost in Dress to Impress?


You’ll need 299 Robux to unlock a month of VIP status or spend 799 Robux to unlock it permanently. This translates to $10 for permanent VIP access and roughly $3.99 for the monthly one. If you plan on sticking with the game for a while, the perm…</span>

It is the adaptation of the still-running manga of the same name, which has just had its 18th volume released on January 5th.


The anime&#x27;s first season has recently come to a close, but — given its overwhelming audience love — I&#x27;m willing to bet we&#x27;ll be seeing more Dandadan in the near future.


The events of the anime&#x27;s season one go from the start of the manga up until the end of the fourth volume, where it ends on a cliffhanger. The story still has a long way to go to even catch up with the manga, and it was only in one of the latest episodes that we caught a glimpse at what the series&#x27; main plot would be about.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all happening.
Following a GameStop database leak revealing &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; accessory SKUs yesterday, a similar situation has now supposedly played out with French retailer &#x27;Fnac&#x27;.
The retailer&#x27;s website reportedly features multiple placeholder listings for the Switch &quot;successor&quot;. It&#x27;s believed these could be different bundles offered by the retailer. Apart from this, there&#x27;s also at least one item of software listed for the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;. This appears to be a game by Take-Two:

Another accessory manufacturer has decided it&#x27;s ready to show off some new &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; products. This time it&#x27;s Skull &amp; Co with an all-new &quot;NeoGrip&quot; accessory, which will allow you to get a better grip on Nintendo&#x27;s new system in handheld mode.
Here&#x27;s a look, and as you can see - these same images seem to feature the new hardware that hasn&#x27;t even been announced by Nintendo yet. Wild, we know!

The prologue starts you off as the handsomely equipped and fully levelled-up bodyguard of Sir Hans Capon - an exasperating gadabout and your bosom chum from the 2018 game. You&#x27;re on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he&#x27;ll take your own lord&#x27;s side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

The researchers who are probably robots and you usually pick because they can be competitive at anything. The diplomacy/espionage ones (humans, or The Greys).
You know what I&#x27;m talking about. You may well have thought of a recent exception too, since we&#x27;ve had a fair few 4Xeses experimenting with some of the standard formulae these last few years. It&#x27;s been a while though since I read through every word of every faction&#x27;s description and wanted to play all of them. Zephon captured my interest immediately.

The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It&#x27;s a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I&#x27;d had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year&#x27;s Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.
Unrelated, but I&#x27;ve decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.

                              <span>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here&#x27;s one. You&#x27;ll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the &quot;Remastered&quot; version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - &quot;Account for PlayStation Network required&quot;. For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won&#x27;t be on sale in your country at all. Sony&#x27;s reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

Zemědělské a stavební stroje závislé na katastrální mapě nemohou pracovat. Banky nemohou ověřovat údaje, takže ani schvalovat úvěry, hypotéky apod. Realitní trh úplně stojí. Dědická řízení, jejichž součástí jsou nemovitosti, nebo pozemky, stojí. v Bratislavě např. nejde ani vystavit parkovací kartu pro rezidenty. Koupě a prodej nemovitostí je úplně zastaven. Tím ale výčet nejspíše nekončí. Další informace např. na aktuality.sk.</span>

Ever one to snatch up a DLC crossover, Square Enix has today announced that PowerWash Simulator will be getting taken on a Grand Day Out later this year with the arrival of the &#x27;Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack&#x27;.
We still don&#x27;t have a precise release date for this one just yet, though the above reveal trailer showcases some of the mucky locales that we&#x27;ll be a-scrubbing when it does arrive. We catch glimpses of the West Wallaby Street kitchen (complete with moving model train set), the interior of Wallace&#x27;s rocket, the workshop and Gromit&#x27;s kennel in the front garden.

How are we coping, nine days into the year of the Switch 2? It&#x27;s been an utter onslaught of leaks and rumours and noise as everyone clamours to find out about Nintendo&#x27;s to-be-officially-announced console. C&#x27;mon Nintendo, it&#x27;s really time to say something.
Anyway, let&#x27;s cut through the noise for a second. Here at Nintendo Life, some of us have been asking a big question — literally — about the Switch 2. We&#x27;ve been having a bit of a debate in the office: Is the Switch 2 going to be a bit too big for a portable?

Nintendo has announced that it is collaborating with Lego to launch a brand new set based on the classic Game Boy handheld.
Currently scheduled to launch in October 2025, the set follows on from the Lego NES set that the companies launched back in 2020. Presumably, however, it probably won&#x27;t be quite so ludicrously expensive. Well... we&#x27;ll see, you never know.

So when the High Court of Delhi gave the site&#x27;s operators 24 hours to end infringement in March 2024, that looked promising. Yet the site remains online, despite subsequent High Court orders. According to site&#x27;s Indian operators, it is not possible to comply with High Court orders because a major DoodStream investor comes from Russia.

                              <span>Ubisoft are delaying Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows again, but this time, not just out of concern about the quality of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into &quot;various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders&quot;, with news of a possible major &quot;transaction&quot; to follow.

                              <span>The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character&#x27;s scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you&#x27;re seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I&#x27;m not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about &quot;a land full of people being made into a people without land.&quot;

Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn&#x27;t do it, wrong. I know I&#x27;ve already put you off, so I don&#x27;t blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn&#x27;t stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.

The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access back in 2016. I didn&#x27;t know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.

                              <span>As someone who believes in the ideal of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that&#x27;s housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

It&#x27;s an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more &quot;stimulation&quot; you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer&#x27;s processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.

                              <span>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

                              <span>Yesterday, we reported that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China&#x27;s armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;. In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent&#x27;s chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they&#x27;re prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn&#x27;t resolved.

The game projects in question include the Kerbal Space Program series and an unannounced project from Pokémon developer Game Freak.

                              <span>Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that&#x27;s what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they&#x27;ve just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it&#x27;s all based on a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

                              <span>Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you&#x27;re stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that&#x27;s the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection&#x27;s most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

                              <span>Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming&#x27;s long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer&#x27;s veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth&#x27;s cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character&#x27;s visual design.
Now it&#x27;s time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn&#x27;t, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.

Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands.

                              <span>It’s not being spelt out overtly, but there is a whiff of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs being pitched as what the Alchemist generation should have been. Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

                              <span>The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as &quot;SNES-style&quot;. This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let&#x27;s see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There&#x27;s a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I&#x27;d put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

                              <span>An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store&#x27;s rules. But it&#x27;s still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

                              <span>Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player&#x27;s question about why violence is the &quot;default&quot; path in so many big budget RPGs. That&#x27;s specifically RPGs with &quot;AAA&quot; budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that &quot;evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world&quot;, and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

                              <span>The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening soulslike Tyrant’s Realm is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

                              <span>Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

                              <span>As New Year&#x27;s Day dawns, the bells ring out from the steeples of old London town. The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; blocking system was originally invented to protect time-sensitive live sports streams from pirates. A year later, rightsholders are pushing for an update to cover a wider range of content, including films. This move, which is expected to be discussed in a forthcoming consultation, aims to gradually expand the &#x27;next-gen&#x27; blocking system.

                              <span>York Crown Court has sentenced a man from Halifax to two years in prison for selling &#x27;pirate&#x27; IPTV subscriptions loaded on Fire Sticks. Rightsholders and authorities hope that the criminal prosecution of the 41-year-old (re)seller, who served a few hundred customers, will send a deterrent message. However, the big fish in this hugely profitable industry remain unscathed.

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.
This week, it’s ITU Copenhagen Games Professor and Broken Rules co-founder, Martin Pichlmair! Cheers Martin! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

After pulling in 302 million visits in September, the pirate streaming site added almost 62 million more in October. That earns the platform a GlobalRank of 120, and a U.S. streaming sector rank higher than Disney Plus.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté &quot;hradní&quot; Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry.

                              <span>Steam Deck, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit Marvel Rivals can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it&#x27;s from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital &quot;C&quot;, poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it&#x27;s a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

The events will include a player who will beat a set of Elden Ring boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of Crazy Taxi with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear &quot;all romances&quot; in Fallout: New Vegas within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?

                              <span>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? &quot;Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!&quot;. Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.

                              <span>In a continued effort to combat online piracy, Japanese publishing giant Shueisha has requested a DMCA subpoena to compel X to expose two &#x27;pirate accounts&#x27;. This is the latest move to identify the operators of major manga pirate portals through U.S. federal courts. If the operators of Spoilerplus and Mangaraw are identified, they could potentially be sued in Japan.

                              <span>I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I&#x27;m interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you&#x27;re trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. &quot;Bioshock Infinite in space&quot;, we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it&#x27;s more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

                              <span>I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield&#x27;s manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

                              <span>Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio&#x27;s next game a &quot;metaverse&quot;, although he says he&#x27;s wary of using the term. The project is called &quot;Artemis&quot; (at least for now) and you won&#x27;t be seeing it any time soon. That&#x27;s because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it&#x27;ll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn&#x27;t say specifically what those things might be. He doesn&#x27;t know how his user-led &quot;multiverse of worlds&quot; will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless &quot;full of confidence&quot;.

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It&#x27;s like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where&#x27;s Wally.

Six times I’ve tried to pass your FPS test by killing three monsters to prove I’m human. Six times I’ve failed. For thousands of years, people have asked what it means to be human. It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.

                              <span>Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

                              <span>Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel &quot;Seith&quot; Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they&#x27;ve properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven&#x27;t updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as &quot;Ghost Of A Tail&quot; is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

                              <span>In 2022, a group of Israel-based TV companies obtained a court order in the U.S. It compelled every ISP in the country to block three resilient pirate sites that blocking in Israel had failed to stop. Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they&#x27;re unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

                              <span>Italy launched its ambitious &quot;Piracy Shield&quot; platform in early 2024, hoping to finally curb the rampant piracy of live sports events. Throughout the year, the system has primarily targeted the domains and IP addresses used by pirate IPTV providers to stream illegal content. Official data made available to the public is limited but with help from data provided by an anonymous source, we can identify key trends from a very controversial year.

                              <span>My Selection Box picks are of three games that I did not vote for in the Advent Calendar. Two of them didn&#x27;t come out this year, which is an easy disqualification, but the reality is that I also don&#x27;t think any of them truly deserve a place in one of those hallowed chambers.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Despite major shifts in leadership, the MPA-backed coalition of media companies secured key victories, including the high-profile takedown of the Fmovies piracy network.  ACE also reported a number of other successes and has already set its sights on new &#x27;pirate&#x27; targets for the coming year.

                              <span>Unlike a lot of the team I&#x27;d imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn&#x27;t. One I hadn&#x27;t even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

                              <span>As part of my end-of-year benchmarking and various historical comparisons, over the holidays I was curious to take a look at how the mature AMD EPYC 9004 &quot;Genoa&quot; performance has evolved over the past two years under Linux. Going off benchmarks I ran back at the end of 2022 on the same AMD Titanite EPYC reference server platform for two EPYC 9654 Genoa processors, I repeated the same tests using the newest releases of Intel Clear Linux and Ubuntu Linux for seeing how the performance has evolved.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m quite proud of the delights that we packed behind each door of the Advent Calendar this year, to be honest. All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven&#x27;t played but I&#x27;d watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don&#x27;t quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year&#x27;s end. So here&#x27;s my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It&#x27;s an unusually diverse triad this time.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Missed my deadline because I bought a new matress yesterday and spent most of the day lounging, limbs akimbo like a petulant starfish making noises no starfish has or will ever make? Missed the streak? You are simply wrong. Time has no bearing here. Here is the column. I&#x27;ve been reading Mark Forsyth&#x27;s books on words and this very good New Yorker column about Kanye West smashing up an architectural masterpiece.

                              <span>For the past several years, the recording industry has branded stream-ripping services the leading piracy threat. On the near horizon, the industry claims that the rise of generative AI presents a new and rapidly evolving challenge for the music ecosystem that threatens its long-term sustainability. According to global industry group IFPI, stream-ripping is likely fueling this secondary threat.

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that&#x27;s the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it&#x27;s like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character&#x27;s shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson.

                              <span>If pushed, I’d describe my 2024 gaming habits as eclectic, but that would actually be a lie.

A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping &quot;ordinary users&quot; to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

                              <span>My selection box isn&#x27;t really a selection box. It&#x27;s a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I&#x27;m dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I&#x27;ve actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I&#x27;m going to gamble on recommending a few I&#x27;ve barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let&#x27;s begin.

                              <span>Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

                              <span>&quot;A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements&quot;, was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

                              <span>I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

                              <span>Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It&#x27;s not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

                              <span>Early on in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novel The Light Fantastic, a spell is cast to map the world. It begins as a &quot;fireball of occult potentiality,&quot; dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly &quot;embryo universe.&quot; The embryo expands &quot;lightly as a thought,&quot; with spectral continents &quot;sleeting&quot; through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of &quot;shining threads that followed every movement.&quot;

                              <span>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic&#x27;s board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you&#x27;re not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they&#x27;re already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I&#x27;m only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I&#x27;m on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

At least that&#x27;s what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called &quot;Cocijo&quot;. Don&#x27;t worry, they got him.

                              <span>Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both &quot;shifting market trends&quot; - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for &quot;narrative-driven, story-rich games&quot; - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

                              <span>At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

                              <span>The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn&#x27;t the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri&#x27;s situation at the start of the game.

                              <span>&quot;We are a people who honour democracy,&quot; said the dog, scratching himself. &quot;Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.&quot; The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator&#x27;s personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was &quot;hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.&quot; I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there&#x27;s a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn&#x27;t half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud&#x27;s low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

                              <span>Insults are so serious, these days. They&#x27;re all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I&#x27;ve found or made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... &quot;a strategic capital and business alliance agreement&quot;. What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

                              <span>They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

                              <span>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod&#x27;s features has ballooned. It&#x27;s now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff &#x27;em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.
