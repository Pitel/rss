After Festival of the Lost 2024&#x27;s wizard-themed armor sets, Bungie is now steering back towards the event&#x27;s horror roots. What better way to do so than with a suite of monster costumes from contemporary pop-horror media, then? Once again, players get to vote on each of the three Classes&#x27; respective armor sets, and it is going to be a tough choice.

                              <span>The Bloody Baron is the first important sub questline you can come across in Velen, the first area from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s main quest. Though you might tackle it before or after the &quot;Hunting a Witch&quot; quest, I&#x27;d recommend you do the Baron&#x27;s story first.


The titular man might immediately strike you as a typical good-for-nothing drunken abuser — as he struck me — but don&#x27;t let the game fool you. Despite his many flaws, the Bloody Baron is a surprisingly deep character with intricacies that require your attention should you want to experience the full emotional range of this story. The Bloody Baron&#x27;s questline is one of the best and definitely the most harrowing one you&#x27;ll encounter in the base game.

                              <span>Motion blur sucks, and that&#x27;s coming from someone who does use it. In video games, it generally helps smooth out the perceived frame-rate in a video game, but it also smears the image to a ridiculous degree. The good news is that BlurBusters might have an alternative.


As you may or may not know, the old cathode-ray tube screens weren&#x27;t without merit. Heavy, clunky, and egregiously outdated in some respects, CRTs handled motion much, much better than any modern screen does. This isn&#x27;t magic, justthe nature of the beast: Black Frame Insertion came part-and-parcel with these displays, drawing lines of pixels (phosphors, really) so quickly that motion remained crystal-clear no matter your refresh rate. Modern displays don&#x27;t have BFI by default except in select rare cases, and there&#x27;s usually…</span>

A major part of the update is the End of Year event, which is now active in the game. By completing the quests, you&#x27;ll be able to get time-limited rewards for your efforts. Let&#x27;s look at how to maximize your rewards from this event before it expires from the game.

To begin the event, you&#x27;ll have to go to the Christmas Event gym, which can be done by clicking the New Year&#x27;s Event button.

                              <span>Corrupted Soul is a pretty important item you can find in A Universal Time, and following the AUT 4.2 update, the importance has gone up.


This specific item is required for certain functions. For instance, if you want to obtain the reworked Umbra Ability inside the game, you&#x27;ll need to get the Corrupted Soul to complete the process. Needless to say, it&#x27;s not an easy item to obtain.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how to get it inside A Universal Time.


How to get Corrupted Soul in A Universal Time


As you complete the game, you&#x27;ll come across loot chests. These chests can be obtained by completing different quests. You can also get them by clearing Boss fights, and they can help you get a lot of valuable resources. The Corrupted Soul is also among one of those items that can drop from the Loot Chests.


While getting chests might not be a hard task, the difficulty increases if you&#x27;re specifically looking for Corrupted Soul. The odds of it dropping from the chest are low since it&#x27;s an Epic item, so it&#x27;s best to have many chests to improve your chances. That way, you will have better odds (although the chest-specific odds don&#x27;t change based on how many you open).




An easier way out is to go down the trade route. If you have a friend who might want to trade it to you, the job is done. You can do the same with any other player as well, but they will want something amazing in return. Make sure to offer something substantial in exchange to sway their minds.


The Corrupted Soul will be essential to unlock the reworked Umbra Ability. It&#x27;s substantially better than its older form, and here&#x27;s a complete guide that will help you to unlock it in A Universal Time&#x27;s 4.2 Update.

                              <span>The Season 4 Pass is now live in NBA 2K25, and you can now grind a fresh set of rewards.


There are 40 levels of rewards for you to obtain, covering both the MyCareer and MyTeam modes. The method of unlocking them is pretty much the same, as all you have to do is play games and earn Season XP. 


Let&#x27;s take a look at the full set of rewards, which also includes the options you get if you opt for the Pro upgrade (which costs real-life money).

                              <span>Jujutsu Infinite provides a wide set of choices in Innate Techniques, but not all of them are equally effective.


The techniques and their effectiveness often boil down to their rarities if they have Maximums to unlock, and also the type of content. PvP is a different experience from the typical PvE content, and you&#x27;ll have to ensure you get your build on point.


Let&#x27;s look at some of the best Innate Techniques you can employ for PvP.


Best PvP Innate Techniques in Jujutsu Infinite


For the best, I have gone for the S and A-tier techniques. The S-tier techniques, as listed on our tier list, are easily the best available options. Thanks to their potential and Maximums, these techniques are by far the best you can have.

                              <span>Come August, it will be nine years since we had a Deus Ex game, Mankind Divided, released in 2016. Some of you unfamiliar with the series may be shrugging your shoulders right now. &quot;So what?&quot; you may say, &quot;we&#x27;re still waiting on Half-Life 3.&quot; However, much like the elusive Half-Life installment, fans of the exploits of Adam Jensen also never got closure.


You see, Mankind Divided ended on a rather disappointing note, with the closing moments of the game strongly suggesting more was to come. However, it never emerged. As such, it&#x27;s become a major sore point in Deus Ex&#x27;s history, and the game&#x27;s writer appears to agree.

                              <span>While there might&#x27;ve been some skepticism over Nvidia RTX Remix, there&#x27;s merit in this project yet. Though it&#x27;s still a work in progress, the astonishingly good-looking Need for Speed: Underground RTX mod shows just how potent RTX Remix can be. And you can start playing it right now, to boot.


I&#x27;m not one to bemoan the current state of the Need for Speed franchise, as I genuinely feel that Unbound is on to something special. At the same time, though, there&#x27;s no denying that Underground, Underground 2, and Most Wanted were the heyday for the series, and it&#x27;s a real shame that there&#x27;s no official remaster or remake in tow. That&#x27;s where Alessandro893&#x27;s RTX Remix version of the original 2003 NFS: Underground comes into the picture. Don&#x27;t believe me? The neon speaks for itself, I feel.

How to unlock push in Shrimp Game


Shoving other players requires pushing the Push action in Shrimp Game&#x27;s store. You can access this shop using the store icon on the left side of your screen or the shop terminal in the main lobby between rounds. It costs ₩375,000 in-game cash, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about stockpiling Robux to unlock this feature.

                              <span>Despite releasing to PS5 in 2020, The Last of Us Part 2 is only just about coming to PC. On the one hand, it will be the remastered version when it is released (it&#x27;s up to you to decide whether a four-and-half-year-old game even needs remastering). However, if you&#x27;re planning to get your gritty zombie action on via Steam or Epic Games Store, you won&#x27;t be able to escape Sony&#x27;s clutch.


As noted by VGC, if you want to play The Last of Us Part 2 on PC, you&#x27;ll need to connect a PlayStation Network account in order to do so. Indeed, if you look on the game&#x27;s Steam page, you can see it says so on the right-hand column.




This is despite two things:



TLoU is a single-player game, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to require a PSN account.


A similar tactic was tried last year with Helldiver 2. Guess how that went down...



It seems Sony has learned nothing


As the report from VGC also points out, having to have a separate account in order to play through Steam or Epic renders the game useless in countries that don&#x27;t have PSN. Obviously, this means a lot of people around the world won&#x27;t be able to play The Last of Us Part 2 (remastered or not) when it comes to PC this April.


While Sony has reneged on this decision in the past – doing a complete U-turn when it tried to introduce it to the aforementioned Helldiver 2 – the company also admitted it was &quot;still learning what is best for PC players.&quot; However, this doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case if Sony goes forward with PSN requirements for a PC port of a single-player game.


There was also the incident in September 2024 when a mod for God of War Ragnarök removed the PlayStation Network requirement altogether. This alone should show how unpopular it is. Will Sony relent for The Last of Us Part 2? It seems well within its best interests to do so. Sadly, I have no influence over that decision.

                              <span>The AUT 4.2 update is now live in A Universal Time, and the Umbra Ability has been handed a major rework to how it works.


The rework has certainly upped the potential of this ability and made it a lot more competitive and effective than it was in the past. Naturally, it will make a lot of sense for you to obtain and use it in the game. Despite a rework, the process of obtaining it is quite lengthy, to say the least. There are several quests you&#x27;ll have to complete in order to unlock the Umbra Ability in AUT 4.2 update.


How to unlock Umbra Ability in A Universal Time (AUT 4.2 update)


To start the process, talk with the Umbra NPC located at the Floating Village. The NPC will be located right next to its clone. After talking with the NPC, you&#x27;ll be handed a set of tasks that will requir…</span>

                              <span>Sometimes in life, challenges have to be completed by using nothing other than meat. Well, I don&#x27;t know how true that is, but it might definitely be the case for this Roblox game. If you have been wondering what exactly you have to do in order to complete the Butcher&#x27;s Method challenge in Guts and Blackpowder, keep reading, and we&#x27;ll guide you through it.


How to complete the Butcher&#x27;s challenge


The basic objective you have to complete in order to ace this challenge is, apparently, simple. Just play on a single map in the game by using only the &quot;delicious leg&quot; weapon. You&#x27;ll also have to get 50 kills, and you are not allowed to use any guns or grenades. If that isn&#x27;t enough, you will also have to beat that map.


So it might sound not that difficult, to survive a map and get 50 kills by…</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Center has officially revealed the theme of the next Elite Trainer Box expansion and what players can look forward to being included. Among the goodies in the Journey Together set are something that hasn’t come around in years — Trainer’s Pokémon cards. 


Trainer’s Pokémon cards were introduced to the collection early into the life of the Pokémon TCG, with cards such as Misty’s Seel or Brock’s Onyx now being fond memories for those who were lucky enough to pull them and play them in their decks. It’s been a very long time since we had any new Trainer’s Cards as part of the collection, but the Journey Together Elite Trainer Box and expansion will introduce four new ones:



N’s Zoroark ex


Lillie’s Clefairy ex


Iono’s Bellibolt ex


Hop’s Zacian ex



The box and expansion will be released under the title of “Battle Partners” in Japan on January 24, and will reach the west as the Journey Together box on March 28, with pre-purchase beginning two weeks earlier.

While the Trainer’s Pokémon cards are definitely the highlight of the upcoming release, there are plenty of other goodies in the set to be excited over. Along with the usual dice and counters, there will be 11 Journey Together booster packs included in the box. Each booster pack has a chance to produce the Trainer’s Pokémon cards listed above, as well as the following:



16 Pokémon ex cards


11 rare illustration cards


6 special illustration cards


3 hyper rare gold cards



As stated, Trainer’s Pokémon cards aren’t a new gimmick, but it’s interesting and more than a little exciting to see them making a comeback. If you want a better look at the box itself or the artwork you can expect to see on the booster packs for Journey Together, they’re already live on the Pokémon Center website, although the ability to actually order them is locked until the middle of March.

                              <span>The Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to unlock a special card in Ultimate Team.


Isak has been voted as the best player for December in the Premier League, and EA Sports has released a special card to celebrate his achievements. The price of completing the SBC is pretty low, and so are the requirements.


But is the SBC worth completing right ahead of TOTY? Let&#x27;s find out.


EA FC 25 Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC tasks


The Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC has three tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - Premier League



Min. 1 Players from: Premier League


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 3 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Alexander Isak Premier League POTM SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a set of solutions you can use to obtain the new Isak item.


Task 1 - Premier League



Any 10 84-rated items


Gakpo 83



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 10 84-rated items


Any 83-rated TOTW item



Task 3 - 85-Rated Squad



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Carvajal 86


Ruben Dias 88


Gavi 83


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Nkunku 84



The new Isak item has some strengths and some weaknesses. Its 87 Pace is slightly low, but the 88 Shooting combines well with the 5* Weak Foot. Trivela+ isn&#x27;t one of my preferred playstyles, but he also offers Rapid, Finesse Shot, Power Shot, and Technical. The 75 Passing is a major letdown, but 91 Dribbling is certainly a big advantage. 


If you have the surplus fodder, you can consider completing the challenge. Eventually, he can be improved in a future evolution as well. The SBC isn&#x27;t a bad shout, especially for a combined price of around 90,000 coins, but it could have been so much better.

Maximums aren&#x27;t available for every Innate Technique, and you&#x27;ll have to unlock them. Once unlocked, these superior effects will increase the power and potential of your Innate Technique. As of writing, there are only five Maximum Techniques inside the game.


Let&#x27;s examine which is the best one in my opinion, and why it should be worth your time and investment.

                              <span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues the misadventures of Henry of Skalitz, 15th century Bohemian blacksmith&#x27;s son and chivalric Laddy Lad, who is questing to reclaim his murdered father&#x27;s sword from some absolute shit of a noble. The prologue starts you off as the handsomely equipped and fully levelled-up bodyguard of Sir Hans Capon - an exasperating gadabout and your bosom chum from the 2018 game. You&#x27;re on your way to deliver a message to a distant lord, in hopes that he&#x27;ll take your own lord&#x27;s side in the on-going civil war. But Plot intervenes in the shape of some suspiciously familiar bandits, who slaughter your retinue and reduce Henry and Sir Hans to a pair of shirtless runaways.

                              <span>As a few of you might know, each Sunday at 4pm GMT I run Booked For The Week - a regular chat with a selection of cool industry folks about what they&#x27;re reading, what they&#x27;re hoping to read next, and what books they recommend. The very secret goal of the column is for the guests to name every book ever written. It&#x27;s a task every single one has failed miserably at with two notable exceptions. One was Dan Griliopoulos, who listed 400 books in a document before he got bored and gave up - a heroic, if ultimately futile effort. The other was Warren Spector back in November, who not only gave me the longest and most detailed reply I&#x27;d had before or since, but also followed up several times to add more books to the list.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, and one last thing...&quot; teased the narration for yesterday&#x27;s Like A Dragon Direct showcase on Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii, before announcing that the RPG will be getting New Game+ mode as part of a free post-launch update. It then cut to Majima and his crew making celebratory noises on deck. This follows last year&#x27;s Infinite Wealth catching some backlash for the decision to lock the mode behind a £15/€15/$15 edition upgrade.
Unrelated, but I&#x27;ve decided to stop putting angry spiders through your letterbox every morning. I know, I know. Come on now. Hero is such a strong word.

                              <span>One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here&#x27;s one. You&#x27;ll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the &quot;Remastered&quot; version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - &quot;Account for PlayStation Network required&quot;. For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won&#x27;t be on sale in your country at all. Sony&#x27;s reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure.

Known insider Nate the Hate has claimed in a new podcast that Microsoft will further its multiplatform ambitions in 2025 by bringing both Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Flight Simulator to the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; and the PS5.
The insider – who previously correctly claimed that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would eventually come to PS5 in 2025 following its release on Xbox – elaborated on his statement and said &quot;any  game that comes out this year will at some point find its way to PS5 and/or Switch 2, it&#x27;s just a matter of when&quot;.

Monthly Splatfests are a thing of the past for Splatoon 3 these days, but Nintendo is still keeping the seasonal events coming. With Splatoween out the way, the next one to roll around is Frosty Fest, a festive celebration which will be heading to the Splatlands next month.
As revealed in a tweet by @NintendoUK, the Frosty Fest Splatfest will get underway from 11th-12th January 2025 (depending on your region), with the theme this time asking &#x27;What would make you happiest?&#x27; There are three gift-based teams to choose between, with Team Money, Experiences and Presents all vying for your support.

Last week, accessory maker Genki announced it would be showcasing &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; accessories at CES 2025 and it&#x27;s now delivered on this promise.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV is rich in lore and history. Despite only being around for just over a decade, the world of Eorzea itself feels centuries old, thanks to the stories we hear throughout our adventures. The Twelve are the pillars on which religion in Eorzea is based, but who are they?


In case you haven’t guessed yet, there are 12 of these deities, each corresponding with a month of the Eorzean (and Gregorian) calendar. The importance of these mystical characters has fluctuated over the last 10 or so years, from having an effect on your base stats to their Marks forming a pilgrimage that must be completed by a couple about to go through an Eternal Bonding ceremony.

Going back and forth to check on my progress has sure been frustrating, but things are starting to look up with Treyarch&#x27;s latest reveal.


With the announcement of the Black Ops 6 Jan. 9, 2025 patch notes, Treyarch has confirmed that track challenges are &#x27;currently in the works!&#x27; This news has not only brought a sigh of relief to me but also sparked a wave of excitement among CoD fans, who are eagerly expressing their anticipation in the comments. No longer do we have to be in the dark with our camo challenges during a match, nor do we have to go through the struggles of checking it every single time.

Similar to Fisch, your Shovel is the single most important item inside the game. You can improve your Shovel with the help of enchantments, but you can also switch to better ones. Naturally, not every Shovel is equal, and you&#x27;ll specifically want to look out for the better ones. 


Let&#x27;s look at how the shovels shape up in terms of their in-game effectiveness and stats.

                              <span>Whether you want to capture epic battle moments in Final Fantasy XIV, or you’re really feeling your Glamour and want to immortalize it in photo format, you’re going to be taking a lot of screenshots in the MMO. But where do they end up? And do you get a choice in the matter?


In the six years I’ve been playing FFXIV, I’ve amassed thousands of screenshots. I have more photos of my Miqote than I have of myself in real life, and I’ve even ended up with an external hard drive dedicated to storing online memories. Even the beginning of my relationship with my now-fiancé, who I met while playing, is chronicled through screenshots—a surprisingly common occurrence.


Here’s how to find your screenshots, how to change the save destination to make things easier in the future, and other tips to help…</span>

                              <span>Overflowing Palettes are a brand new type of puzzle found throughout all of Wuthering Waves 2.0, and they can be quite tricky to solve. If you&#x27;re having trouble with them, here are a few tips and tricks you can use to get yourself closer to the solution.


How to Complete Overflowing Palettes in Wuthering Waves


Overflowing Palette puzzles can be difficult to solve because the solution to them is not always obvious. More often than not, the color you need to switch all the blocks to is not the color you want to start using immediately. In most cases, the objective color is the last one you want to use after you&#x27;ve prepared all the other blocks to swap to that color.


The best way to approach these puzzles is with a focus on connectivity. Blocks are only recolored if they are, in some way, connected to each other. Since you only have two to three moves you can make, it is important to recognize how you can connect disconnected blocks in as few moves as possible.

You&#x27;re aiming to connect everything together, in an Overflowing Palette puzzle, so that you can change all the disconnected blocks into one connected color. When everything is connected and colored, the puzzle becomes significantly easier to decipher because you know exactly which blocks will have their color altered when you aim to paint another color over them.


Another key aspect of this puzzle is reducing the number of colors in the puzzle itself. The more blocks of a different color present, the more difficult these puzzles are to finish. Ideally, this is your primary goal over everything else initially, and it ties in directly to what I mentioned earlier about coloring disconnected blocks. 


These tips will help you solve every single Overflowing Palette puzzle available in Wuthering Waves 2.0, as they all follow the same core aspect of color control and connectivity.

                              <span>Robot Arm is a very specific item you can find in Anime Last Stand, but it&#x27;s also important to obtain if you&#x27;re looking to evolve the Ninja character inspired by Nagato.


This item is specifically required for this one purpose, but it can be hard to obtain. Let&#x27;s take a look at the best way to farm a Robot Arm in Anime Last Stand, followed by how to use it properly and efficiently.


How to get Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand


As of writing, there&#x27;s only one way to get this particular item, and it&#x27;s not even easy. You&#x27;ll have to complete Stage 6 of the Leaf Village raid in Anime Last Stand, which is easier said than done. If you thought that managing to complete this stage and the raid was difficult, there&#x27;s more bad news.


Once you complete the raid, there is a 3% chance for you to get Robot Arm, which is really low. Thankfully, there&#x27;s a pity system that ensures that the probability increases in your favor if you don&#x27;t obtain it. Once you clear this raid for the 30th time, you&#x27;ll be guaranteed a Robot Arm from the drop. Of course, repeating the same activity 30 times can be tiring, but you&#x27;re at least assured of the resource you&#x27;re looking for.




How to use Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand


The Robot Arm is required when you want to evolve the Almighty Ninja (Paths) character. Evolving him will transform him into his Resurrected form, which is far more powerful than his Paths form. Both forms might be of Ultimate rarity, but Almighty Ninja (Ressurected) is on a different level.


Hence, it&#x27;s certainly worth putting in the effort to get a Robot Arm, even if the task might be quite hard to complete.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re someone just getting started in Dig It, applying mutations on your valuables could help you to get extra cash.


The core objective of the game is to use your Shovel to find valuables buried in the ground. While you can become wealthy by targeting more precious resources, you can also improve how much you get from the more ordinary ones. This can be done with the help of mutations, which makes it easier for you to get in-game money.


All Mutations in Dig It


Put very simply, mutations increase the value of any item you can dig from the terrain with your Shovel. To use mutations, you&#x27;ll have to appraise the object that you want to sell and improve its valuation. Here&#x27;s the full set of all ten options available inside the game.


Mutations
Multiplier




Wooden
x1.1


Rusty
x1.15


Hot 
x1.25


Biodegradable 
x1.5


Festive
x1.5


Golden
x2


Neon
x2


Holy
x3


Magma
x3


Quantum
x5






How to appraise in Dig It


The main issue with mutations is their random nature, as you can&#x27;t predetermine which one you want on an object. To apply mutations, you&#x27;ll have to appraise an object at Nookville Island. Go to the Central Junkyard and select the object you want to appraise.


Pay the required money, and the object will be thrown in a pit and then returned with a mutation. Remember that there are chances for it to return without any mutation as well, so make sure that you have extra cash in your inventory. If you&#x27;re trying for Quantum, Magma, or Holy mutations, make sure to pray for extra luck.

Dědická řízení, jejichž součástí jsou nemovitosti, nebo pozemky, stojí. v Bratislavě např. nejde ani vystavit parkovací kartu pro rezidenty. Koupě a prodej nemovitostí je úplně zastaven.

V rámci srazu si můžete vyslechnout 2 krátké přednášky: Jiří Eischmann: vhsky.cz – přednáška představí PeerTube, otevřenou alternativu k YouTube, a bude se věnovat rozjezdu Vhsky.cz, české instanci PeerTube, na které se momentálně nachází také videa z konference OpenAlt a Jozef Mlích: chytré hodinky pohledem linuxáka – Proč chtít chytré hodinky, co se s nimi dá dělat bez ztráty soukromí. Různé střípky z vývoje doprovodné aplikace a komu darovat starší zařízení (třeba s vybitou baterkou). Přednáškový blok bude pravděpodobně živě streamován na vhsky.cz.</span>

Ever one to snatch up a DLC crossover, Square Enix has today announced that PowerWash Simulator will be getting taken on a Grand Day Out later this year with the arrival of the &#x27;Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack&#x27;.
We still don&#x27;t have a precise release date for this one just yet, though the above reveal trailer showcases some of the mucky locales that we&#x27;ll be a-scrubbing when it does arrive. We catch glimpses of the West Wallaby Street kitchen (complete with moving model train set), the interior of Wallace&#x27;s rocket, the workshop and Gromit&#x27;s kennel in the front garden.

How are we coping, nine days into the year of the Switch 2? It&#x27;s been an utter onslaught of leaks and rumours and noise as everyone clamours to find out about Nintendo&#x27;s to-be-officially-announced console. C&#x27;mon Nintendo, it&#x27;s really time to say something.
Anyway, let&#x27;s cut through the noise for a second. Here at Nintendo Life, some of us have been asking a big question — literally — about the Switch 2. We&#x27;ve been having a bit of a debate in the office: Is the Switch 2 going to be a bit too big for a portable?

Nintendo has announced that it is collaborating with Lego to launch a brand new set based on the classic Game Boy handheld.
Currently scheduled to launch in October 2025, the set follows on from the Lego NES set that the companies launched back in 2020. Presumably, however, it probably won&#x27;t be quite so ludicrously expensive. Well... we&#x27;ll see, you never know.

                              <span>Eh, what&#x27;s up Dock?
When Nintendo released the 3DS, it equipped all new game cartridges with a plastic nub, preventing them from being inserted into your classic clamshell. Why are we bringing this up as &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; leaks reach fever pitch? Because accessory manufacturer Genki (the talk of the town this week) has claimed that a similar &#x27;indentation&#x27; approach has been used to keep people from squeezing their new console into a &#x27;Switch 1&#x27; dock (thanks, IGN).
In case you haven&#x27;t graced the internet in the past 48 hours, Genki has taken this year&#x27;s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) by storm, showcasing its upcoming accessories via a &quot;Switch 2 replica&quot;. This model, which is allegedly based on the real thing and appears very much in line with what every other leak has suggested, has given us our best look yet at what &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; might be (remember, Nintendo is still yet to officially reveal anything). What&#x27;s more, the accessory manufacturer has been answering questions about it.

Nintendo has released a new trailer looking at the story for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition on the Switch.
Currently slated to release on 20th March 2025, the game is an enhanced version of the Wii U classic, boasting improved visuals and brand new story content. Clocking in at just over 3 and a half minutes, the new trailer sheds light on the game&#x27;s plot, backstory, and characters to bring you up to speed before its release. There&#x27;s also a small hint at some of the additional content that returning veterans can look forward to.

Accessory manufacturer Genki has well and truly stuck its middle finger up to Nintendo in recent days, opting to openly showcase its planned accessories for the as-yet unannounced &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; during CES 2025.
Now, in a new interview with The Verge, Genki&#x27;s co-founder and CEO Eddie Tsai divulged a few more details regarding the console itself, including the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers. According to Tsai, pressing the release buttons on the back of the Joy-Con causes a small pin to protrude from the side of the Joy-Con, thus pushing it away from the main body enough to break the magnetic connection.

This is a warning to all those who are yet to play Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club and want to work through the mystery unspoiled: do not watch Nintendo&#x27;s latest trailer for the game.
Yesterday, Nintendo uploaded a new trailer for the 2024 mystery entitled &#x27;What Lies in the Past&#x27; (we&#x27;ve linked it in that last sentence but won&#x27;t be embedding it for obvious reasons). It&#x27;s an innocent-looking title and, without any form of warning at the start, bar the age certification the Nintendo of America upload, you would be forgiven for thinking it&#x27;s just another promo. Perhaps, at a stretch, the reveal of some upcoming DLC. But no, it&#x27;s actually loaded with late-game content that you might want to avoid.

After arriving overseas at the end of last year, McDonald&#x27;s restaurants across the UK have now finally got their hands on a Sonic the Hedgehog 3-themed Happy Meal, though the tie-in toys are a little different to those found in the US (thanks, Eurogamer).
Yep, while our friends across the pond landed plastic figurines of Sonic and co. to mark the arrival of the third movie, UK Happy Meals instead get a range of fabric balls with the faces of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Shadow emblazoned on the front. There are also some, uhh, Super variants of select characters, but we won&#x27;t get into that here.

                              <span>4.3 million Switch 2 sales predicted.
Despite the sheer excitement surrounding Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming reveal and release of the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;, Circana (NPD) analyst Mat Piscatella has predicted that Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 will sell more units in the US this year overall.
Speaking via Bluesky (thanks, Push Square), Piscatella states that he expects the Switch successor to sell around 4.3 million units in the region, provided it launches within the first half of the year. That&#x27;s still a pretty hefty number, but Piscatella reckons there will be some hardware constraints after an initial surge of high demand. As such, he thinks the PS5 will ultimately outsell the Switch 2.

It&#x27;s a new year and that means brand new games are already on the way! January isn&#x27;t always the most happening month of the year, but in 2025 there&#x27;s plenty to be excited about. Our senior video producer Zion Grassl also bought a PS5!
Back to the upcoming releases on the Switch though, there&#x27;s Donkey Kong, Star Wars, another Tales game, and much more to look forward to - so here&#x27;s the full rundown for the first month of the year:

So when the High Court of Delhi gave the site&#x27;s operators 24 hours to end infringement in March 2024, that looked promising. Yet the site remains online, despite subsequent High Court orders. According to site&#x27;s Indian operators, it is not possible to comply with High Court orders because a major DoodStream investor comes from Russia.

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you&#x27;re seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I&#x27;m not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.

Dreams On A Pillow is a stealth adventure that tells the story of a young mother during the Nakba - the 1948 ethnic cleansing, displacement, and cultural suppression of Palestinian Arabs by Israel. As its funding campaign puts it, it’s a game about &quot;a land full of people being made into a people without land.&quot;

                              <span>A long, long time ago I became obsessed with watching people play rally games beautifully. It was a blessing to see those disembodied hands sling virtual cars around with grace and precision, kicking up dirt in a way I could only dream of.
Now, though, I am going through a different phase. A less blessed phase. One where I watched the popular streamer and influencer Ludwig attempt to climb to Platinum rank in League Of Legends, all because he wanted to prove another popular streamer, who thought he couldn&#x27;t do it, wrong. I know I&#x27;ve already put you off, so I don&#x27;t blame you if you stop reading. Just know that I couldn&#x27;t stop watching his streams, even as it conjured up terrible memories of a time spent doing the exact same thing at uni.

Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.

It launches January 10th at 1 am PT / 4 am ET / 9 am GMT, and developers NetEase are paving the way in the traditional manner by rebalancing the character line-up so as to simultaneously win the adoration of certain player groups, while plunging others into apoplectic fury.
Do you like running rampage as Hela, goddess of death? Was that you who shot me full of crows on Klyntar last night? Well, how does 25 points off your base health suit you? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Screw you too.

The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access back in 2016. I didn&#x27;t know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.

                              <span>Microsoft has once more made some loud noises about a possible handheld gaming device. Back in November of 2024, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer confirmed the company is “working on” a handheld gaming device, but said that it was “years out.” Now, speaking to The Verge at tech show CES, another senior Microsoft employee has…

                              <span>As someone who believes in the ideal of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at CES 2025, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that&#x27;s housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.
The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a one hundred percent chance I will ruin it.

Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including a seven-part diary series featuring many a starfaring Vengabus or Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider.
It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into Steam early access on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.

                              <span>The more I tell you about Stimulation Clicker, the less funny it will be, so let&#x27;s keep this brief. It&#x27;s an idle clicker, obviously, which starts with a single button in the centre of a browser screen. The more &quot;stimulation&quot; you accrue through clicking, the more options become available. It escalates. And escalates. And escalates. I found that my feelings of delight grew roughly in proportion to the toll taken on my computer&#x27;s processor. After 30 minutes, I was huffing and hooting like a drunken horse to a soundtrack of disintegrating laptop fans.

                              <span>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast Ryzen 7 9800X3D almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their Core Ultra chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.
No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.

                              <span>Yesterday, we reported that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China&#x27;s armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.
At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;. In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent&#x27;s chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they&#x27;re prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn&#x27;t resolved.

                              <span>God-wrecking MOBA Smite 2 is going free-to-play next week after four months of paid early access. The game of omniscient deities scrapping over lanes and minions has been playable since September last year by early bird &quot;founders&quot; willing to pay some bucks (it had plenty of closed alphas since May too) but now it&#x27;s finally opening up to the rest of us mere mortals. And it&#x27;s throwing in a new &quot;god&quot; too, the genie-toting thief Aladdin.

                              <span>In a fairly exciting case of two major industry stories meeting in the middle, former members of downfallen indie publisher Annapurna Interactive have reportedly joined forces to take control of several game projects previously published by Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s label Private Division, which has itself been sold off amid layoffs. The game projects in question include the Kerbal Space Program series and an unannounced project from Pokémon developer Game Freak.

                              <span>Last night at CES 2025, Sony and HBO announced that The Last of Us’ second season will premiere on Max in April. The seven-episode season will cover only part of The Last of Us Part II’s story, as HBO plans to split the events of the 2020 sequel across multiple seasons. Based on this trailer, it seems like the…

                              <span>Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.
And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that&#x27;s what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they&#x27;ve just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it&#x27;s all based on a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;.

The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed SteamOS handheld outside of Valve’s own Steam Deck range.

                              <span>Last night, at CES 2025, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series graphics cards, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.

The setup here is that you&#x27;re stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light.

The development of 2020 FPS Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by Stephen Totilo’s Game File (paywalled) in which Call Of Duty creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.

Yet that&#x27;s the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection&#x27;s most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.

                              <span>Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming&#x27;s long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer&#x27;s veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth&#x27;s cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character&#x27;s visual design.
Now it&#x27;s time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn&#x27;t, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

                              <span>I don’t want to talk to a game. I assume I’m not alone in this, because the tech’s been around for donkey’s and barely anyone tries to use it. Mass Effect 3 tried voice commands. Socom U.S Navy Seals shipped with a headset. &quot;Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room,&quot; wrote a Redditor on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. &quot;Gimme the clunky buttons instead&quot;.
Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir puzzler that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. &quot;Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes,&quot; reads the Steam page. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>In the live sports broadcasting arena, dynamic blocking of pirate IPTV streams is seen as increasingly useful to tackle a prevalent and highly resilient form of illicit content delivery. Yet as the highly-publicized blunders of 2024 showed, getting blocking wrong benefits nobody. To that background, a blocking specialist at anti-piracy company Friend MTS is encouraging restraint.

                              <span>It’s not being spelt out overtly, but there is a whiff of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs being pitched as what the Alchemist generation should have been. Those eventually grew into their PCIe shoes, but only after months of dial-shifting driver updates – whereas the flagship B580 promises Nvidia-besting games performance from the off. Even at such a stage in the current graphics generation (the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 could be revealed literally tonight, at CES 2025), there is something enticing about that proposition.

                              <span>The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as &quot;SNES-style&quot;. This led to a social media dog-pile of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, a howl of derision that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. 
Let&#x27;s see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There&#x27;s a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. Please find it here on Itch.io. Perhaps if I&#x27;d put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.

                              <span>An upcoming life sim which claims to be a competitor to Grand Theft Auto VI is continuing to amass followers and wishlists on Steam, despite the game being unmasked as a vehicle for a dodgy cryptocurrency. Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store&#x27;s rules. But it&#x27;s still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.

                              <span>Original Fallout designer Tim Cain, also known for co-directing The Outer Worlds at Obsidian, has published a video responding to a player&#x27;s question about why violence is the &quot;default&quot; path in so many big budget RPGs. That&#x27;s specifically RPGs with &quot;AAA&quot; budgets, whatever AAA means these days. Cain is, of course, well aware that there are many RPGs from smaller teams that &quot;evolve past the paradigm of violence being the default way in which the player interacts with the world&quot;, and that there are plenty of puzzle games, adventure games and the like in which there is no violence at all.

                              <span>The baggiest thing about PS1-harkening soulslike Tyrant’s Realm is the ratty pair of prisoner pants you start out with. Everything else is pleasingly austere. It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.

                              <span>Last June, Valve’s trading card game Artifact Classic peaked at 78 players. November was a little rosier for the abandoned multiplayer game, with a monthly peak of 1,028. Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; blocking system was originally invented to protect time-sensitive live sports streams from pirates. A year later, rightsholders are pushing for an update to cover a wider range of content, including films. This move, which is expected to be discussed in a forthcoming consultation, aims to gradually expand the &#x27;next-gen&#x27; blocking system.

                              <span>York Crown Court has sentenced a man from Halifax to two years in prison for selling &#x27;pirate&#x27; IPTV subscriptions loaded on Fire Sticks. Rightsholders and authorities hope that the criminal prosecution of the 41-year-old (re)seller, who served a few hundred customers, will send a deterrent message. However, the big fish in this hugely profitable industry remain unscathed.

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.
This week, it’s ITU Copenhagen Games Professor and Broken Rules co-founder, Martin Pichlmair! Cheers Martin! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

After pulling in 302 million visits in September, the pirate streaming site added almost 62 million more in October. That earns the platform a GlobalRank of 120, and a U.S. streaming sector rank higher than Disney Plus.

                              <span>Následuje neupravovaný text zajímavého prohlášení, které vydal můj oblíbenec Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer k nové verzi slovenské hymny:


S úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýská&quot; již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté &quot;hradní&quot; Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti.

                              <span>Steam Deck, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit Marvel Rivals can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll be blunt: the only thing that really entices me about SpaceCraft is that it&#x27;s from Shiro Games, creators of such robust RPG and strategy fare as Dune: Spice Wars, Evoland, Northgard and Wartales. As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital &quot;C&quot;, poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it&#x27;s a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.

Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear &quot;all romances&quot; in Fallout: New Vegas within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?

                              <span>How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? &quot;Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!&quot;. Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.
Still, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum.

                              <span>In a continued effort to combat online piracy, Japanese publishing giant Shueisha has requested a DMCA subpoena to compel X to expose two &#x27;pirate accounts&#x27;. This is the latest move to identify the operators of major manga pirate portals through U.S. federal courts. If the operators of Spoilerplus and Mangaraw are identified, they could potentially be sued in Japan.

                              <span>I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I&#x27;m interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you&#x27;re trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. &quot;Bioshock Infinite in space&quot;, we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it&#x27;s more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.

                              <span>I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield&#x27;s manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.
In Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.

                              <span>Indiana Jones is a man with hands. Deny this at your own peril. ‘Write what you know’ they say. Indiana Jones And The Great Circle’s writers knew about having hands. They’d picked up a thing or two. Turned the odd key. Raised the occasional entire lemon to their lips and devoured it whole. Clicked a camera button. Placed an object upon a table. They had touched things, and beyond this, they had felt them. They knew that the player could never truly be Indiana Jones, but they could be allowed to make a pretend man who sounded at least 83% like Indiana Jones do things with his hands that very much resemble the sort of things Indiana Jones might do.

                              <span>Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game PUBG: Battlegrounds, wants to make his studio&#x27;s next game a &quot;metaverse&quot;, although he says he&#x27;s wary of using the term. The project is called &quot;Artemis&quot; (at least for now) and you won&#x27;t be seeing it any time soon. That&#x27;s because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it&#x27;ll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. 
Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn&#x27;t say specifically what those things might be. He doesn&#x27;t know how his user-led &quot;multiverse of worlds&quot; will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox. He is nonetheless &quot;full of confidence&quot;.

The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It&#x27;s like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where&#x27;s Wally.

It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.

                              <span>Ekphrasis is a concept from ancient Greece (who bloody loved a good concept) describing the act of creative writing inspired by a work of art. Is a Ryanair Boeing 737 safety manual art? Well, Johnson A Plane Man has done some ekphrasis with it, so I say yes. It’s a short browser Itch game that chronicles the life and times of a man named Johnson, his love for yellow life vests, his existential feelings of confinement (despite the high number of easily locatable exits), and such emancipatory joys that can only be found in yellow slides.

                              <span>Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.
The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel &quot;Seith&quot; Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they&#x27;ve properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven&#x27;t updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as &quot;Ghost Of A Tail&quot; is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)</span>

                              <span>In 2022, a group of Israel-based TV companies obtained a court order in the U.S. It compelled every ISP in the country to block three resilient pirate sites that blocking in Israel had failed to stop. Intervention by Cloudflare ended that dream and 2.5 years later, despite other measures targeting the sites, it appears that at least one is still going strong. The TV companies are now taking legal action against UK ISPs; they&#x27;re unlikely to put up a fight, they may not even turn up in court.

                              <span>Italy launched its ambitious &quot;Piracy Shield&quot; platform in early 2024, hoping to finally curb the rampant piracy of live sports events. Throughout the year, the system has primarily targeted the domains and IP addresses used by pirate IPTV providers to stream illegal content. Official data made available to the public is limited but with help from data provided by an anonymous source, we can identify key trends from a very controversial year.

Yet all three are games that in some way defined my year, and I feel affection for each of them. Let me explain why.

Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>Anti-piracy coalition ACE wraps up a transformative and successful year. Despite major shifts in leadership, the MPA-backed coalition of media companies secured key victories, including the high-profile takedown of the Fmovies piracy network.  ACE also reported a number of other successes and has already set its sights on new &#x27;pirate&#x27; targets for the coming year.

                              <span>Unlike a lot of the team I&#x27;d imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn&#x27;t. One I hadn&#x27;t even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>I&#x27;m quite proud of the delights that we packed behind each door of the Advent Calendar this year, to be honest. All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven&#x27;t played but I&#x27;d watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don&#x27;t quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year&#x27;s end. So here&#x27;s my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It&#x27;s an unusually diverse triad this time.

Missed my deadline because I bought a new matress yesterday and spent most of the day lounging, limbs akimbo like a petulant starfish making noises no starfish has or will ever make? Missed the streak? You are simply wrong. Time has no bearing here. Here is the column.

                              <span>For the past several years, the recording industry has branded stream-ripping services the leading piracy threat. On the near horizon, the industry claims that the rise of generative AI presents a new and rapidly evolving challenge for the music ecosystem that threatens its long-term sustainability. According to global industry group IFPI, stream-ripping is likely fueling this secondary threat.

Point being, I can present to you my almost-made-it picks without malice nor bitterness, unlike my loser colleagues who didn’t get as many in the main list. Nyeh nyeh.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don&#x27;t need to shoot, but it&#x27;s sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip.

                              <span>The final verdict in a Danish site blocking battle, involving LaLiga and Rojadirecta, confirms that live sports broadcasts are protected copyright works. This marks a significant victory for rightsholders, who believe that this landmark decision paves the way for increased blocking of pirate streaming services across Europe.

                              <span>2024 was my first full year at RPS, and as a guides writer, it was a year packed with the sort of games that make you roll your sleeves up, wipe sweat from your brow, and stare up at the sky from the trenches, ruminating on what life is like when you aren&#x27;t dealing with back-to-back Soulslikes interspersed with gacha games that feature incomprehensible lootbox mechanics.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping &quot;ordinary users&quot; to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

                              <span>My selection box isn&#x27;t really a selection box. It&#x27;s a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I&#x27;m dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I&#x27;ve actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I&#x27;m going to gamble on recommending a few I&#x27;ve barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let&#x27;s begin.

                              <span>Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Better join in the campfire revelry, because whoever&#x27;s there won&#x27;t be staying for long.

                              <span>Happy weekend all. Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year. Well, I’m pretty sure nobody did one. I can’t see anything scheduled in the RPS Post-A-Tron, but the RPS Post-A-Tron is an unreliable beast, full of malice and deceit. If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

                              <span>&quot;A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements&quot;, was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

                              <span>I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

                              <span>Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It&#x27;s not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

                              <span>Early on in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novel The Light Fantastic, a spell is cast to map the world. It begins as a &quot;fireball of occult potentiality,&quot; dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly &quot;embryo universe.&quot; The embryo expands &quot;lightly as a thought,&quot; with spectral continents &quot;sleeting&quot; through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of &quot;shining threads that followed every movement.&quot;

                              <span>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic&#x27;s board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you&#x27;re not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they&#x27;re already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company.

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I&#x27;m only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I&#x27;m on a frostbitten quest to find out. Here are the most winter-iest games you can pick up for cheap.

At least that&#x27;s what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called &quot;Cocijo&quot;. Don&#x27;t worry, they got him.

                              <span>Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both &quot;shifting market trends&quot; - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for &quot;narrative-driven, story-rich games&quot; - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

                              <span>At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

                              <span>The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn&#x27;t the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri&#x27;s situation at the start of the game.

                              <span>&quot;We are a people who honour democracy,&quot; said the dog, scratching himself. &quot;Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.&quot; The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator&#x27;s personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was &quot;hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.&quot; I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there&#x27;s a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn&#x27;t half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud&#x27;s low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

                              <span>Insults are so serious, these days. They&#x27;re all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I&#x27;ve found or made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... &quot;a strategic capital and business alliance agreement&quot;. What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

                              <span>They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

                              <span>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod&#x27;s features has ballooned. It&#x27;s now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff &#x27;em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

                              <span>After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the &quot;democratic government&quot; of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and &quot;Liber-tea&quot;, they&#x27;ve teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you&#x27;ll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone&#x27;s despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there&#x27;s the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing &quot;freedom&quot; to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead&#x27;s wanton aggression, which absolutely isn&#x27;t a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

                              <span>Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it&#x27;s the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin&#x27;s suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.
