                              <span>Unhinged Studios has officially announced their roguelite deckbuilder, dev_hell based on the soul-crushing experience of working as a programmer in an office environment. It’s set to release on PC this year.


Before getting paid to write bad words, I spent nine years working in I.T. as a technician. That’s not the same as being an office programmer, but it is adjacent. The biggest difference is that people at least understood that I was going to fix their computer. For normal people, programmers just perform whatever magic they’re told to. And if they can’t perform that magic, they have failed.




Dev_hell puts you in the shoes of a new hire at a tech company looking to “change the future.” Not only do you have to program a lot of questionable features and meet the company’s expectations of you, you also need to exert constant positivity and build relationships with your co-workers. Because when shit hits the wall, you may need a few human shields to protect your career. You constantly add to a growing deck of cards that help you do your job better, or at least make it look like you’re doing your job well.


I feel like most people who have experience working in the office will find the trailer to be unsettlingly familiar. Everything from superficial interactions with co-workers to bafflingly ineffective “incentive” programs. It’s absolutely too damned real. Looks like fun!


Dev_hell is coming to PC sometime in 2024.

                              <span>HoYoverse has released a new Developers Discussion previewing some new quality of life changes coming to Genshin Impact Version 4.4. One of these is a new artifact loadout feature that, while exciting at first glance, might not be what players expected.


Not the loadouts we’re looking for


From very soon after the launch of Genshin Impact, players have voiced the need for artifact loadouts. By this, they meant a system similar to Honkai 3rd’s Plans that allows players to save a character’s equipment set, making it easier to switch builds on the go. Genshin Impact characters often have multiple builds or share gear with other characters, so an artifact loadout system has been a common demand within the community for the past three years.

                              <span>Along with a recent RTX Remix, the classic Tomb Raider games are about to come back in a pretty big way. Aspyr has been hard at work remastering the original three entries in the iconic series, and we&#x27;ve been given a bit of a breakdown of what&#x27;s to come.


A recent post on the PlayStation Blog gives us a few details on the upcoming Tomb Raider remasters, which are set to release on February 14 (ooh, la la). Going way back to 1998 when the studio helped launch the second game on Mac, Aspyr is more than familiar with Lara&#x27;s adventures.




This modern take on the classic installments will be brimming with the usual. We&#x27;ll get up-to-date controls that &quot;take inspiration from the Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld era.&quot; However, the studio will also be keeping the original tank controls for that dose of retro authenticity.


If looks could kill


Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be a remaster without some fresh visuals that don&#x27;t veer too much from the source material. The post goes on to say that Aspyr has swapped out the 2D sprites for 3D models, as well as implemented real-time lighting effects, polished environments and character models, and more.


And because this is a modern game (or at least a modern interpretation), Tomb Raider Remastered will also come bundled with a photo mode. And much like the tank controls, you can switch between the newer and classic visuals, if that&#x27;s your bag.


It&#x27;s impressive that the series is still going after almost 30 years. If you are interested in raiding some tombs from a bygone era, the remasters will be coming to current and previous-gen consoles, as well as PCs.

                              <span>The multiplayer hit The Finals is still receiving new content, this time in the form of an update and a new gameplay mode. 


You can expect plenty from the new update as well as, for the first time, a limited-time game mode. In this mode, called Solo Bank It, you compete in a 12-player PvP on a quest to obtain a total of 40,000 Cash wins. Sound like your kind of thing?


The game mode comes alongside update 1.5.0 which features several improvements to make life easier for players. Perhaps most importantly, you get a security update to improve &quot;anti-cheat and fair play.&quot; While this is beneficial, it should be noted that Easy Anti-Cheat is the reason why the game can&#x27;t be played on the Steam Deck. 


Update 1.5.0 also brings a store update, balance changes, and bug fixes, which you see more of in the trailer below. 




The Finals hit the world stage with a surprise drop at The Game Awards. SteamDB reveals that while the game has had its highs and lows, it maintains popularity with an all-time peak of 242,619 concurrent players in December 2023.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know what it is about the Final Fantasy 7 battle theme, but it always gets my blood pumping. Square Enix released a new trailer for the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Rebirth titled Destined for Rebirth. The trailer focuses on showcasing part 2 of the series which focuses on Cloud and his crew traveling across the planet in search of Sephiroth.




Rebirthed


Around the halfway mark of the one-minute trailer, the classic Final Fantasy 7 battle theme kicks in. Of course, it&#x27;s the enhanced version from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, not the classic original FF7 version. But it still rocks, and even more so. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s part nostalgia or what but I still think it&#x27;s one of the best battle tracks in all of gaming.


The trailer showcases several fight scenes featuring Cloud, Barrett, Tifa, Aerith, and even Red XIII before culminating in a final showdown with Sephiroth in all his one-winged glory. Overall it&#x27;s an extremely well-put-together trailer even though it&#x27;s only a minute long. We see several classic locations including Junon and Costa del Sol, while also showing a glimpse of the new content coming in the sequel such as more Zack. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was already my most anticipated game of 2024, but this trailer dialed the hype meter up to an 11/10.


Also, all of the voice acting in Rebirth is already looking to be top-notch. But I&#x27;d like to throw a kudos to Cody Christian who voices Cloud. There&#x27;s a scene in the trailer where Cloud yells out to Tifa and wow you can you really feel the emotion. Assuming that Rebirth follows most of the story from the original, it we&#x27;re certainly in for a wild emotional ride. And, with the added element of voice acting that was missing when the original released back in 1997, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to be even more intense.


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on PlayStation 54 on February 29, 2024.

                              <span>The Famicom can be perceived as the birthplace of kusoge. While bad games have existed since the creation of the medium, the origin of the term itself is murky but generally is believed to have been coined in reference to a Famicom game.


Hoshi wo Miru Hito, translating roughly as Stargazer, was one such game that rose to the rank of kusoge no densetsu (crap game of legend). It’s easy to see why. RPGs blew up in Japan following the release of Dragon Quest in 1986, and here is a game that was quick to capitalize on that with one set in a sci-fi environment. It even predated Phantasy Star by roughly two months, but not Ultima, which had been doing sci-fi since 1982. Nonetheless, Hoshi wo Miru Hito wasn’t short on inventive ideas for the genre.

PTW was previously called Pole To Win and its services include quality assurance, studio support, and localization. Last week, on January 11, someone with knowledge of the studio told Kotaku about the layoffs, noting that roughly 45 people lost their jobs. 
The person with the knowledge of PTW also told the publication that the majority of those laid off live outside the United States – it has studios in North America, Europe, and Asia – and were QA workers. However, jobs were cut in other departments, too, Kotaku notes.

                              <span>Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game&#x27;s teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.</span>

This review originally went live in 2014, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to celebrate the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s Game Boy Advance library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Back in 2001 (2002 in Europe) some players were left feeling short-changed when Golden Sun reached its abrupt ending. Developer Camelot – perhaps better known for the Shining Force series and, more recently, its Mario sports titles – expanded on its original plan and split the game into two parts. Those who’d already invested in the story had to wait nearly a year and a half for part two, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, to witness the proper ending. Fortunately, newcomers to these JRPGs don&#x27;t have to face the same agonising wait to see the story through to its conclusion.

Golden Sun expands on proven genre archetypes to deliver an experience that both pays tribute to and refines the classic role-playing adventure. It&#x27;s a franchise that has a loyal following; whether it&#x27;ll ever return with a new title has been a hot topic for those fans for many years now — the last entry in Camelot&#x27;s series was 2010&#x27;s Dark Dawn on Nintendo DS.

The new year is well underway and with this in mind one of the first major releases is out this week. It&#x27;s Ubisoft&#x27;s new sidescroller Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.
So far, it&#x27;s been well-received by critics and the demo also seems to have gone down well with fans. This has got us wondering here at Nintendo Life how the community is feeling about it, so vote in our poll and comment below.

This particular episode takes place four years before the original Slave Zero game, dating back to 1999. It&#x27;s been developed by many of the same developers who worked on Slave Zero X. You can access the free experience by going to the Add-ons menu in Quake.

As much as I know dev_hell will be incredibly unsettling… I&#x27;m in.

Blizzard have formally unveiled the brooding action-RPG&#x27;s Season 3, aka Season of the Construct, which launches at 6pm GMT and 10am PST on January 23rd, and features a new quest line in which you investigate an ancient technology, the Loom, created by the mage Zoltun Kulle, which has now been purloined by the demon Malphas.
Along the way, you&#x27;ll both fight deadly arcane constructs or fantasy robots, and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren&#x27;t just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

                              <span>As the release of the (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft approaches (yes, that is its full and official Steam title) on February 14th, developers Aspyr have detailed some of the game&#x27;s new features over on the PlayStation Blog, and how they&#x27;ve approached bringing the art, controls and effects up to date for 2023. Personally, I&#x27;m extremely pleased to see they&#x27;ve added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I&#x27;m also heartened to see they&#x27;ve kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

                              <span>Dave The Diver was one of last year&#x27;s surprise hits, but though some called it an indie game, it was actually the work of Mintrocket, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Nexon. Now Mintrocket have announced their next game and it seems less likely to cause such confusion. It&#x27;s called Wakerunners, and it&#x27;s a team-based &quot;battle action game&quot; about heroes smashing at each other.

It&#x27;ll have a demo in Steam Next Fest next month and there&#x27;s a teaser trailer below.

Mezi hlavní novinky patří nová architektura WoW64, která umožňuje využít 64bitová volání z 32bitového kódu. To znamená, že je možné spouštět 32bitové aplikace systému Windows na čistě 64bitové instalaci hostitelského systému. V původním řešení bylo nutné pro běh 32bitové aplikace spouštět 32bitový hostitelský proces. Nový režim není zatím ve výchozím stavu zapnutý a je nutné ho povolit v konfiguraci.</span>

                              <span>As reported by VideoGameChronicle, Square Enix confirmed at a recent press event that their upcoming live service game, Foamstars, uses some assets generated by AI. This follows a New Year’s letter from the company’s president, Takashi Kiryu, that stated the company would more aggressively pursue the use of the technology.


VGC asked Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani about AI, who elaborated on the game’s usage of it. According to him, most of the game was created by humans, but “0.01% or even less” was generated by Midjourney. Specifically, as Square later clarified to VGC, the assets that were created by generative AI are in-game album covers for the game’s music tracks.




Okatani explained: “In this instance, we experimented with Midjourney using simple prompts to produce abstract images. We loved what was created and used them as the final album covers players will see in the game. Everything else was created entirely by our development team.”


The usage of generative AI has been creeping in from all angles despite a variety of different concerns. Among these are worries about hastily generated games flooding the market and squeezing out small developers, the contraction of job opportunities within the industry, the straight-up theft that is central to implementations of the technology, and the impact on the environment from the high energy requirements. It’s a complex subject.


However, it does remind me that Splatoon, a game that Foamstars seems to be trying hard to be, also does album artwork for its songs. Except those are made by real human artists. And it’s just funny to me how this endeavor can be derivative and yet still cut corners in the process. It’s what we get to look forward to.


Foamstars is releasing on PS4 and PS5 on February 6, 2024.

Just as adorable as his name, Peanut Butter is a Shiba Inu who also happens to be an expert in assisting with Gyromite&#x27;s Game B mode. Game B had Nintendo&#x27;s short-lived robot assistant R.O.B. do the heavy lifting, pressing actuators to move pipes so Professor Hector can make it through each level unscathed. In this run, however, it was Peanut Butter who did all the hard work. You can see just how good this boy is right here.




The Peanut Butter Solution


While Peanut Butter makes it all look easy, speedrunner JSR spent a year training him to take over the role of the R.O.B. controller. He does so with a bespoke contr…</span>

                              <span>My sister introduced me to Homestar Runner via Strong Bad Email #48 &quot;Ghosts.&quot; That was back in 2002, and I remember spending the rest of the evening watching everything else on the site. Then, I watched basically everything that The Brothers Chaps, Mike and Matt Chapman, put on the site from then on. Homestarrunner.com became as much of a friend to me as any of the actual humans who surrounded me during my high school days.


But, exactly like my high school friends, we went on to do our own thing. Homestar Runner gradually became more and more sporadic, as did I. Every once in a while, however, The Brothers Chaps would emerge to release something new for fans. At one point, there was nearly five years of silence before it was broken by Fish Eye Lens.

                              <span>Long-time UK games retailer GAME won&#x27;t be accepting trade-ins when February 16 rolls around, according to Eurogamer. GAME&#x27;s parent company Frasers Group has officially confirmed its plans to remove the trade-in program to BBC News on Tuesday.


&quot;As part of the integration of GAME, we will be phasing out the trade-in, pre-owned and Game Elite offerings in the UK over the coming months,&quot; said a spokesperson of Frasers Group to BBC News. This effectively hands off mainstream game trading to CEX, a popular used media retailer in the British Isles.

The remaining pre-owned stock that GAME has acquired will be available on store shelves while they last. It will be curious to see how long copies of disappointing titles like Anthem and old sports games will remain in GAME before it throws them out. Frasers Group hasn&#x27;t given an official reason for this decision, but it&#x27;s likely due to lacking sales in the used game market.


&quot;PlayStation and Xbox were not as big a part of the sales as they were [due to supply constraints],&quot; said GAME CEO Nick Arran to GamesIndustry.biz in 2023. &quot;But our toy business really came into its own, with staggering numbers at Christmas.&quot;


GAME could be switching gears to toys and other similar goods like Pokemon cards instead of its video game titles as gamers look towards an all-digital future. Ars Technica reported in 2022 a 30% drop in available physical games from 321 in 2018 to 226 in 2021. It was also leaked that the next Xbox Series X refresh called Brooklin might be digital only. 


Perhaps GAME sees the writing on the wall as the gaming industry slowly moves past a used game model, which used to have 100 million titles traded in every year in the US alone.

The most important content with each new season is the seasonal theme and mechanics. In Season of the Construct, players will team up with Zoltun Kulle&#x27;s former companion, Ayuzhan, and take on the demon Malphas.

                              <span>Exoprimal launched at an interesting time, to say the least. Hitting in a surprisingly packed summer window, just after the release of a Capcom giant in Street Fighter 6, it&#x27;s been quite the curiosity to follow.


To be up-front, I dig Exoprimal. Blasting apart hordes of dinosaurs with giant mech suits is already a good pitch on paper, and I spent a fair share of time carving through waves of prehistoric predators with my pals. While it takes some time to show its hand, there are some phenomenal moments and fights, especially as players advance deeper into its story through multiplayer missions, similar to the original Titanfall.




On Thursday, January 18, Exoprimal kicks off its third season with a bang: a Monster Hunter collaboration. The crossover brings over new Beta variant Exosuits…</span>

                              <span>It looks like the upcoming open-world FPS Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is getting another delay. Originally scheduled to be released in 2022, the shooter now has a tentative release date of September 5, 2024. According to a video by developer GSC Game World announcing the release date, this is the &quot;final&quot; release date.




Detailing the decision, GSC indicated that thousands of players got the opportunity to play Stalker 2 for the first time during Gamescom 2023. After some playtests, GSC felt the game needed a little more time on the technical side of things. Originally the team was dedicated to releasing Stalker 2 in early 2024, but certain technical issues have popped up triggering the new delay.


It&#x27;s always a bummer when a game gets delayed, especially a highly anticipated one like Stalker 2. But with so much hype around this sequel, it&#x27;s certainly important for the team to get things just right. The developers have also had a myriad of challenges impacting the development process, so it&#x27;s very understandable that the game has taken a bit longer than expected to release.


Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is now set to release on September 5, 2024 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>Naughty Dog&#x27;s 2020 masterpiece has received a re-release in the form of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. It won&#x27;t turn heads on a technical level, but it does pack some new content that makes it worth considering even if you&#x27;ve experienced the epic tale already. 


Some of the features have been advertised by the studio, but there are a few minor additions that you may not be aware of. If you&#x27;re still on the fence regarding whether you should try out the game, consider whether these features are enough to lure you back in.

                              <span>After initially planning to launch the series in late February, the premiere date of Pokémon Horizons on Netflix has been pushed back a couple of weeks. The next iteration of the anime series will now launch the first week of March in the United States.


No reason was given for the nearly two-week delay, but the Pokémon Company did drop a new trailer to help make the wait a bit less painful. 




Pokémon Horizons: The Series now begins streaming on March 7


Netflix confirmed that the new premiere date for Pokémon Horizons in the U.S. is Thursday, March 7. It&#x27;s only a 13-day delay, but still a delay nonetheless. Eager fans ready to continue on with the anime series will have to wait a wee bit longer. 


As for the new Pokémon Horizons trailer, it&#x27;s really just more of what we&#x27;ve already seen. We&#x27;re teased with the new lead duo of Liko and Roy in the Kanto region. There are mysterious pendants, new friends and foes, and of course, fresh Pokémon to catch. 


We&#x27;ll journey along with you when Pokémon Horizons: The Series begins streaming March 7.

                              <span>Zigurrat and Poppy Works have released a free add-on for Quake based on the upcoming game Slave Zero X. More than just a beefy slice of marketing, Slave Zero X Episode Enyo is a mod that serves as a prequel to the main game’s narrative.


The mod boasts six levels, eight weapons, and an original soundtrack. You play as one of the main antagonists from Slave Zero X, the eponymous Enyo. She’s out to assassinate Sovereign Khan, or “SovKhan,” as his friends call him.




The press release pushes the fact that the add-on can run on Nightdive’s remastered version of Quake. It’s available directly through the add-ons menu, so you can download and play it on consoles as well as PC. However, they’ve also released it standalone to be run on the various Quake source ports.


I have to say, it’s a pretty big flex to promote your game with a Quake mod. I’ve played a bit of it myself, and it’s not a quick hack job. Its levels are pretty elaborate, and while you can recognize some assets from the base game, it’s mostly all new. More importantly, however, it shows an understanding of Slave Zero X’s audience. I was initially keeping the game in my peripherals, not really paying it much mind, but now it’s firmly in my sights. I’m curious how it will tie into this Quake mod.


The title itself is a prequel to 1999’s Slave Zero for Dreamcast and PC, and while I don’t think you need any familiarity to get into Poppy Works’ new title, an affection for it certainly helps.


Slave Zero X releases on February 21, 2024 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch. Episode Enyo is available now for Quake.

                              <span>Certainly, there is a glut of Early Access shooters on the market right now, but some of them genuinely are trying to innovate. Contain, for one, is due to release in beta form on January 16, and it is trying to combine Control, SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect), and Ready or Not into one.


Shoving experimental New Weird storytelling techniques into a tactical FPS envelope is, naturally, a rigmarole in and of itself, but Contain appears to be trying to go a step further still. Notably, the game features comprehensive gunsmithing and operator outfitting systems that appear to rival even those of Ground Branch and Escape from Tarkov. Talk about being prospective right off the bat.

                              <span>Movie adaptations of video games have proven themselves to be lucrative when done correctly. Martha is Dead is one of the next titles to get the treatment, and it may be one of the best choices. 


Martha is Death is developed by Italian studio LKA, and the live-action movie is being made in collaboration with Swedish film-production company Studios Extraordinaires. Much like the celebrated game, the film is set in World War 2, and it focuses on the sisters Martha and Giulia. What ensues next is a mystery that will leave your mind twisted and your hands trembling. 


In the press release, the publisher, Wired Productions, speaks a bit about how fitting Martha is Dead is for a film adaptation, especially due to its &quot;gripping narrative and unique setting&quot; managing director Leo Zullo states. We can expect something a little more special than usual, as the project is being co-directed by André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson who specialize in&quot; crafting high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.&quot;


Ambition is high for this project, and both Hedetoft and Troedsson wish to create something that offers both &quot;fans and newcomers a cinematic tour-de-force, while staying true to the game’s soul-stirring essence.&quot;


Martha is Dead&#x27;s film adaptation has yet to receive a release date.

                              <span>11 bit studios gave a glimpse of the upcoming survival city-builder Frostpunk 2 with a gameplay reveal trailer. The developer and publisher also confirmed that the sequel will be released as a Day One on Game Pass title.  Frostpunk 2 will originally launch on PC in the first half of 2024—where it will be available on Game Pass for PC—followed by a later release on Xbox Series X|S—and Xbox Game Pass—as well as PlayStation 5.




Three Decades Later


The gameplay reveal looks similar to what we saw during a preview event a few months ago, highlighting the shift of focusing on a small ramshackle community from the original Frostpunk to building a sprawling post-apocalyptic city. Rather than placing each building individually, players will now district out areas similar to what you&#x27;d see in Cities: Skylines focusing more on the bigger picture.


Even though the Earth is still ravaged by a seemingly never-ending blizzard, the harsh environment is no longer the biggest threat. Taking place 30 years after the original, humanity has learned to adapt to its new reality for better or worse. However, players will have to manage a new threat: humanity itself.


No longer desperate just to survive, human nature has once again led people to chase an unsatiated thirst for power. Players will have to manage the demands of various factions, trying to keep everyone happy while doing what&#x27;s best for the city.


Frostpunk 2 is shaping up to look like a fine successor to the original, keeping its bleak and intense setting while also being its own thing. I&#x27;m looking forward to keeping the generator running when it releases in the first half of this year.

                              <span>During an interview with Square Enix&#x27;s Naoki Yoshida, the Final Fantasy XIV director and XVI producer has revealed that he thinks it might be better for a younger generation of developers to pick up the mantle and work on Final Fantasy XVII. 


While Final Fantasy fans have become very fond of Naoki Yoshida through his work on both FF XIV and XVI, he has implied that while the team at Square Enix have made no decision about a director for the next title in the series.




In the Game Maker&#x27;s Notebox interview with Sony&#x27;s Shuhei Yoshida, which can be viewed in its entirety here, Naoki Yoshida said: 


&quot;For the moment, I&#x27;ll just say that nothing has been decided yet. That said, if I had to say something about that... I&#x27;ve had the chance to work on two of these, XIV and XVI, so maybe it&#x27;s time for someone new, you know. Instead of having the same old guys handle the next one.”


Yoshida went on to state his reasoning, saying that a younger generation would be able to make a new Final Fantasy title with challenges that &quot;suit today’s world.&quot;


It will likely be a long time before we hear any concrete news about Final Fantasy XVII, but Square Enix is busy working on both Final Fantasy XIV, with Dawntrail coming this summer, and Final Fantasy XVI, with a new story-based DLC in the works and the PC version coming at some point.

                              <span>As reported by RespawnFirst, Take-Two, the parent company of Rockstar Games, has filed a trademark dispute against Remedy Entertainment over the latter’s new logo.


The application was made in April 2023, shortly after Remedy revealed their new logo, and appears to still be ongoing as of writing. It currently looks like Take-Two has not followed through with a lawsuit, and it’s unclear if they have any intention of doing so. It seems more like Take-Two is trying to pre-emptively protect their claim to, uh… the capital R.


Take-Two has been aggressive in protecting its trademarks in the past, including over the use of the letter R in a logo and merely the word “Rock Star.” This kind of stands out since it’s against the developer of Alan Wake 2, which won many awards last year and is in the public consciousness.


Another notable example of this is the 2021 co-op title, It Takes Two. The developer of that game had to drop their trademark on the name after Take-Two disputed its use of the words “Take(s) Two”.


It’s also, in my opinion, ridiculous. The logos aren’t really that similar. They both feature a long capital R, and that’s about it. The fonts are different, they’re stylized in different ways, and the Rockstar logo has a star on it. I’m more likely to get Rockstar confused with Rockstar Energy Drinks, which apparently are unrelated. But then, Take-Two sometimes waves the trademark stick at PepsiCo, as well.


Again, this application may not go anywhere, but Remedy still has to oppose it if they want to maintain the trademark on their logo.

After the release of Hockenheim in December, in comes the Daytona International Speedway, at long last.


More broadly, new race tracks are the most notable repeat additions to Forza Motorsport&#x27;s selection of content following its October launch window. Almost every major new patch has introduced a new track so far, and with Daytona coming in as part of Update 4 later today, on January 16, this seems poised to continue. Sadly, the rest of Update 4&#x27;s content roster is way more transient after all.

Back in August, I had the chance to demo Persona 3 Reload. During that session, I got to check out the game&#x27;s dungeon crawling and one of the early boss fights, both of which impressed me. But one piece of Persona 3 Reload I didn’t get to test was its social systems, which is arguably what makes a modern Persona game... well, Persona. Turn-based combat is fun and all, but spending time with your virtual friends and eating ramen at night just ties the whole experience together.


Fortunately, this was the exact part of Persona 3 Reload I got to try out at another recent event held by Sega/Atlus. Loading a save file in what seemed to be the early-to-mid game, …</span>

                              <span>Sometimes, a game has a lot riding against it, and it has to go the extra mile to prove its excellence. The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered isn’t in the worst position pre-launch, although it has a steep hill ahead of it to prove why it should exist at all. Staying true to its history, Naughty Dog manages to not disappoint, and delivers a package filled with upgrades and a few surprises. 


The studio didn’t have to try too hard to sway me in its direction regarding the game. The Last of Us Part 2 sits up there as one of my favorite games of all time, and around the announcement of the remaster, I was already easing into another playthrough, which I excitedly put on pause to cleanse my palette for this new offering.

                              <span>Foamstars isn&#x27;t unique, but it does offer a colorful, exciting shooter experience. An announcement trailer has revealed that the game launches on Sony&#x27;s console&#x27;s on February 6. 


We got a taste of the game last year thanks to the open beta which ran from September 29 until October 1, and it was generally well-receieved. You&#x27;d be forgiven for confusing the Square Enix-produced open world beta with Nintendo&#x27;s Splatoon franchise, as both games feature players making a colorful mess. 


However, Foamstars presents itself as a more action-packed party with options to fight solo or team up in 4x4 battles. The foam isn&#x27;t there for aesthetic reasons alone. You can also use it to slide on, build with it, and much more. 




Only time will tell whether this is the iconic shooter Sony has been searching for. As a bonus, PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download the game for free from launch until March 4.

                              <span>Morrowind is just one of those games I&#x27;ll always go back to. While Skyrim reigns supreme as the most successful Elder Scrolls game, the third installment in Bethesda&#x27;s series still draws me in. And that&#x27;s to say nothing about the mods that keep it alive.


For example, if I wanted to release my inner creativity, I could opt for &quot;Write Books and Scrolls,&quot; a seemingly simple download that lets you loose on the blank pages of Morrowind.


Image via MomokeCome/Nexus Mods.


Brought to us by Nexus Mods user MomokeCome, it allows players to write their own scrolls and books within the world of TES3. Blank versions can be purchased from sellers, at which point you can put quill to paper and &quot;write your own title and text.&quot;


Eat your heart out, Salman Rushdie


Okay, maybe I&#x27;m over-romanticizing it a bit. But when it comes to fantasy RPGs, not many people think to allow someone to become an in-game writer. We&#x27;re all about having immense stories with rich lore, but this mod gives us the chance to craft some of our own.


The download page doesn&#x27;t say whether the blank scrolls and books come with character or word limits, though. Anyone who&#x27;s played Morrowind and has checked out the sheer breadth of literature available will know that some novels and history books can go on for a few pages.


I could wax lyrical about how I would use the mod to pen the great Elder Scrolls tale. Truth is, I&#x27;d probably just use it to remind my character to pick up more ash yams while in Balmora.

                              <span>A week ago, I told you about how MIS was the next tech firm to be gunning for Steam Deck&#x27;s title in the portable PC market, with a device called The Claw. Well, it seems the company is thinking long, long term, with some newer versions of this yet-to-be-released system on the horizon.


In a recent interview with IGN, System Product Managing Director Clifford Chun discussed The Claw, saying that MSI began developing it two years ago. Additionally, this is just one of a possible four models of the device that are &quot;already in the pipeline.&quot;




Details are scarce, as you would imagine, but it seems the team is anticipating the release of numerous versions as the technology allows for it. When asked about potential release dates, Chun says it &quot;depends on, for example, the CPU or a graphic upgrade down the road,&quot; adding that we should anticipate what MSI will release next.


Has anyone made a Liar, Liar joke yet?


While it&#x27;s tough to say whether Valve should be quaking in its proverbial boots, The Claw is yet one more in a line of Steam Deck competitors.


We&#x27;ve already had offerings from ASUS with its ROG Ally, and Lenovo released its Legion Go last November. Where The Claw may differ slightly is in its hardware, which is actually making use of the Intel Arc GPU technology.


Whether this will set it apart from the others remains to be seen at this stage (it&#x27;s still using Windows 11, much like the ROG Ally and Legion Go). The Claw is set to release sometime this year. Who knows what other companies will be preparing their own mobile PC device by then. Oh wait.

                              <span>Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix is already proving popular with modders, as notable games are being given a new, shiny lease on life. As a result, we&#x27;re getting to see things like GTA, Max Payne, and early Tomb Raider games get something of a spit polish, re-entering our collective consciousness.


I have DSO Gaming to thank for this. A number of recent posts from them show that RTX Remix is able to put a bit of a modern spin on some older releases, such as the aforementioned ones.




In one article, we&#x27;re treated to screenshots from a remixed version of Vice City – complete with Path Tracing – from user PC_Focus. We also have the above footage from turnpike, whose take on the original Max Payne gives the antihero&#x27;s coat a nice sheen. Then there&#x27;s skurtyyskirts, with a remixed version of the first Tomb Raider installment, showing Lara in a new light (literally).


The gaming equivalent of &quot;rewind!&quot;


Given that Nvidia is due to release its RTX Remix toolkit into open beta on January 22, we can expect to see more of this sort of thing happening. The above examples were done in the current version of the modding software, which means they might be improved upon even more at some point.


We&#x27;ve also seen the effect of it working in games like Half-Life 2, so it&#x27;s not just suitable for ultra retro titles (although HL2 is turning 20 this year. Yikes, indeed).


Being able to inject modern techniques into classics, including ray tracing, image upscaling through the likes of DLSS, and more doesn&#x27;t change how these games look or play overall. It gives them a fresh coat of paint and updated visuals, but they aren&#x27;t remakes or even remasters. What they are, however, is a glance at just how far gaming technology has come over the years.

                              <span>Announced on Ubisoft+&#x27;s news page, the company is renaming its subscription service. Now, when you&#x27;re telling your friends about Ubisoft+ Multi-Access and PC Access, you should call it Ubisoft+ Premium instead. 


There&#x27;s another surprise - a new subscription service is on the way. Dubbed Ubisoft+ Classics on PC, it is meant to provide &quot;a curated selection of popular back-catalog and live games.&quot; which includes games like Far Cry 6, Rainbow Six Seige, and Watch Dogs: Legions.


With Ubisoft+ Premium, you get day one and sometimes even early access to the company&#x27;s latest games. Of course, you&#x27;re also able to play Ubisoft&#x27;s extensive library of titles. Ubisoft Premium+ has a subscription fee of $17.99 while you can grab the Classic+ subscription for $7.99 per month.

Philippe Tremblay discusses Ubisoft subscription services


Ubisoft&#x27;s director of subscription Philippe Tremblay naturally praised the services in the announcement. He revealed that subscribers have enjoyed &quot;600 million hours of play&quot; and the company is &quot;above projection in terms of subscribers joining the program.&quot; 


As for what games are being played, Tremblay claims that Assassin&#x27;s Creed and Rainbow Six take the lead. Things never remain static, however, and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage and The Crew Motorfest quickly made their way into the top five in the past couple of months.&quot;


You probably won&#x27;t be surprised to learn that subscriptions help introduce players to games they may have otherwise never touched. As Tremblay highlights, &quot;one in 10 subscribers is someone who has never played a Ubisoft game before.&quot; 


He also confirms that the name change will not change anything for current customers: &quot;PC subscribers will keep their plan as is, with the same monthly price point that they are enjoying right now.&quot;


What&#x27;s in a name? In this case, not too much.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s flagship RDNA 2 graphics card, the RX 6900 XT, continues to drop in price over in the US. Right now you can pick this once-fastest-ever Radeon GPU for just $500 when you buy an open box model from Newegg. That&#x27;s outstanding, given that this card cost twice as much when it debuted in 2020. 
This is the fancy AsRock Phantom Gaming D model too, which brings a snazzy design and a faster 2340MHz boost clock (versus 2250MHz on the vanilla spec).

                              <span>Good news, everyone! One of the best PC gaming handhelds, the Asus ROG Ally, is done to just £599 at Currys in the UK for the higher-powered Z1 Extreme edition. This represents a £100 discount over its launch price and is a good value for a premium handheld that outperforms the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED while having a higher-res and higher refresh rate 1080p 120Hz display.

                              <span>Back in December, Creative Assembly posted a lengthy apology to players for their recent handling of the Total War strategy series, in particular Total War: Warhammer 3 and Total War: Pharoah. Seeking to smooth down feathers ruffled by overpricing and buggy launches, to pick out two of the biggest fan complaints, the developers offered to - amongst other things - make Pharoah’s first paid DLC pack a free update. 
That free update is now upon us, miladies and milords. Available January 25th, it&#x27;s called High Tides, and introduces two new playable factions with their own units and gods and some additional campaign mechanics. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>After teasing a 3D sequel when Prison Architect received its final update last May, developers Double Eleven and publishers Paradox Interactive have announced that, yep, Prison Architect 2 is indeed a thing that is happening - and in 3D, no less. Prisons will now have multiple floors to police, as well as a whole new inmate behaviour system to navigate along the way that will feed into gang warfare, escapes and other budding management problems. It&#x27;s coming out surprisingly soon, too, with its reveal trailer dating it for March 26th.

They&#x27;ve published a new trailer to mark the occasion, in which a group of the game&#x27;s quarantine zone mercenaries squat around a campfire, supping mugs of what probably isn&#x27;t cocoa, and listening to guitar music. It strikes a fitting note of world-weariness.

As spotted by Respawn First, Remedy (they of the Alan Wake) revealed their new logo last year, a big letter R, and Take-Two (they of the owning Rockstar Games) contest it. Rockstar&#x27;s logo is also a big letter R, although I think they&#x27;re pretty different Rs.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all got &#x27;em, right? The games we play to make ourselves feel better, to self soothe, the game we play over the Christmas break. My most recent one has been PowerWash Simulator, because it has clear goals in an organised list, it goes ding, it has a nice white noise... But imagine my shock when I re-installed Immortals Fenyx Rising for the somethingth time, and realised that it has been a comfort game for me all along.
This might make me a massive hypocrite. It&#x27;s a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don&#x27;t know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it&#x27;s doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it&#x27;s sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

                              <span>Having spent what feels like an entire lifetime in JRPG Persona 5 Royal, going back to the original Persona 3 is pretty jarring. It&#x27;s unsurprising given it came out 18 years ago, but exploration is more akin to a slideshow and dungeon-running to a well-rehearsed routine.
But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3&#x27;s  remake felt immediately familiar. It&#x27;s absolutely built for a seamless transition for P5-likers and takes away some of P5 Royal&#x27;s learnings, too. Unless something disastrous happens when Reload fully releases, I can&#x27;t ever see myself returning to the original.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a pitch for you: a spec ops shooter, except it&#x27;s haunted. Well, that&#x27;s exactly what early access co-op FPS Contain is going for, where four of you gear up in tactical clobber and clear corners of military chumps and anomalous… rumps? It&#x27;s a mixture of Rainbow Six, a bit of Stalker, and maybe a touch of Control, with gameplay showing real promise. It&#x27;s also got me thinking about unexpectedly scary moments in shooters, too.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay has said that for all the growth of videogame subscription services in the past few years, players are still accustomed to &quot;having and owning their games&quot;. Accordingly, he feels his task is to help you grow &quot;comfortable&quot; with the idea that the game you&#x27;re playing might be taken offline as part of the release schedule, with Tremblay pointing out that you can still resume your save file when the game is next available.

                              <span>Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by a few of the CD Projekt folk behind The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, have officially titled their forthcoming dark fantasy RPG. That title is… Dawnwalker. They’ve also shared a new teaser image, which I think could depict one of two things: a) a vampiric or otherwise supernaturally-inclined hero flying through the air care of a Dishonored-style Blink teleport, sword raised and clawed fingers stretched towards an unseen foe against a blood-red backdrop. Or b) a man with his trousers aflame swinging through the window of a second floor spa while attempting to use his umbrella as a parachute, having received only half a pedicure before the building caught fire.

                              <span>I worked on the phones when I was in pension admin, years ago, and I fielded some weird ones, but nothing quite as weird as the calls in Home Safety Hotline. It&#x27;s, technically, I suppose, a horror game about manning a call line through a 90s CRT-screen PC, where people will be like &quot;my kitchen is full of droppings that look like coffee grounds, what do?&quot;. You look through your list of potential household hazards and select the right one, so your caller gets sent the info on dealing with cockroaches. Except as your week at HSH goes on, your calls start to be less roaches, more &quot;my house smells like death and my dog is acting strangely&quot; or &quot;I can see someone looking through my window at night and hear them breathing heavily.&quot;

When you think of big, bright colours and shooting, you probably think of one of two things — paintball, or Splatoon. Well, last year, Square Enix unveiled its “online party shooter” Foamstars, and almost immediately, the internet reacted, comparing the colourful foam-shooting game to the inky king of the colours.
Today, in an interview with VGC, the producer of the upcoming online game Kosuke Okatani suggested that he&#x27;d like those comparisons to end as the game is something &quot;completely different&quot;. Upon being asked whether &quot;he&#x27;s bored of comparisons&quot; to the massively popular ink-based shooter from Nintendo. Okatani&#x27;s first reaction was to laugh, and say &quot;First of all, yes,&quot; but there&#x27;s a bit more to it than that.

Update : It&#x27;s official — high street video game retailer GAME will be ending its trade-in and pre-owned business.
Frasers Group, which owns the retailer after purchasing it in 2019 for GBP £52 million, confirmed the news with the BBC earlier today. In a statement, a spokesperson told the news outlet &quot;As part of the integration of Game, we will be phasing out the trade-in, pre-owned and Game Elite offerings in the UK over the coming months... Pre-owned will still be available in our standalone stores across the UK while stock lasts, and Game Elite will still be available until the end of summer.&quot;

We are rapidly approaching the Switch release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong on 16th February and today Nintendo has revealed the game&#x27;s opening movie in all of its remastered glory.
Titled &#x27;Setting the Scene,&#x27; the intro spills everything that you need to know about the game&#x27;s central rivalry: DK has stolen all of the Mini Mario toys and it is up to everyone&#x27;s favourite plumber to get them back. It&#x27;s a simple set-up, but one that has given us the chance to see News Reader Shy Guy in HD, so in our books, it&#x27;s worth it.

Rockstar Games, the juggernaut behind the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is fiercely protective of its IP and image, and so is its parent company, Take-Two Interactive.
So much so, in fact, that the latter has filed a trademark dispute over Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s new logo, revealed back in April 2023. As reported by RespawnFirst (thanks, VGC), Take-Two believes that the new logo bears too much of a resemblance to Rockstar&#x27;s iconic &#x27;R&#x27; logo, stating &quot;there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public&quot;.

Yesterday, Ubisoft launched a rebrand of its subscription service, Ubisoft+ Premium, and brought its Classics package to PC. Clearly, the company sees this as a step into the future of gaming as its director of subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, told GamesIndustry.biz that players need to become &quot;comfortable&quot; with the idea of not owning their games.
The Ubisoft+ Premium service offers access to new (and occasionally upcoming) games on Xbox, PC and Amazon Luna for a monthly fee that currently stands at £14.99 / $17.99. No, it doesn&#x27;t affect the Switch for the time being, but it does point towards the company&#x27;s future approach to sales.

Remember Steel Empire for the Sega Mega Drive? What about the GBA release? 3DS? Well, whichever one you&#x27;ve experienced, if any, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that an updated version dubbed The Legend of Steel Empire is about to drop for the Nintendo Switch on January 23rd, 2024.
Boasting updated visuals and improved controls, The Legend of Steel Empire will receive a boxed and digital release, with physical copies available via retailers like Amazon for £24.99. Looking at the short trailer for the new release, we&#x27;ve got some short comparisons between the game on Mega Drive, GBA, and the HD port. While it certainly looks like a significant step up in visual quality, it&#x27;s nice to see that the core pixel art aesthetic remains intact.

Perhaps the biggest change has come in the rise of Mortal Kombat 1 to third place, remaining one space ahead of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate and pushing Super Mario Bros. Wonder firmly out of the top three — mamma mia!

Yes, a live-action Minecraft movie is really happening. We know Jason Momoa is involved. We know Jack Black is involved. And, as of today, we know that director Jared Hess wants to get it right — or, at least, not get it wrong (thanks, Eurogamer).
In a recent interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, Hess confessed that the production team is keen to &quot;avoid an &#x27;Ugly Sonic&#x27; situation&quot; with the upcoming live-action movie — a reference to the blue blur&#x27;s original design that debuted in the 2019 Sonic The Hedgehog trailer before being swiftly scrapped thanks to the ensuing online backlash.

Masahiro Sakurai has released a new YouTube video looking into the concept of customisation in video games.
It&#x27;s not the most groundbreaking stuff imaginable and it will likely only truly resonate with budding game developers. Still, since Sakurai has announced that he will be winding down his YouTube channel this year, we&#x27;re making the most of it, dagnabbit.

However, since the court issued a dynamic+ injunction, they were free to keep adding domains, JW Player&#x27;s included. Instructions to unblock JW Player&#x27;s domain were not issued until January 9, 2024

                              <span>Developer Embark Studios surprise-launched its free-to-play FPS, The Finals, back in December – Game Informer documented everything that goes into a stealth release like this – and the game has continued to garner a strong fanbase. Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an &quot;experimental&quot; one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 &quot;Cash wins&quot; takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 &quot;comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play&quot; and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot; Its announcement coincides with 2024&#x27;s first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
&quot;Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis,&quot; a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is &quot;to come.&quot; 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that &quot;25&quot; is in the title, it&#x27;s likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two&#x27;s work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar&#x27;s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy&#x27;s new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized &quot;R,&quot; claiming it&#x27;s too similar to Rockstar&#x27;s own &quot;R&quot; logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the &quot;opponent&quot; in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake, which is a single game, has &quot;progressed into a production readiness stage.&quot;
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

The story centers on the demon Malphas getting his hands on an ancient device called The Loom. Created by Zoltun Kulle for benevolent purposes, it’s able to create mechanical constructs, but Malphas has warped the Loom for his own sinister intentions to unleash a plague of evil machines. However, you’ve got your own trick up your sleeves.
Namely, Season of the Construct pairs players with their own mechanized companion called a Seneschal. In addition to lending a hand in combat, tanking incoming attacks, and healing players, the Seneschal serves as the primary power gain system for this season. It f…</span>

                              <span>The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.</span>

                              <span>Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the &quot;final release date,&quot; indicating GSC Game World is confident it won&#x27;t be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today&#x27;s delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine&#x27;s capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir &quot;Fresh&quot; Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we&#x27;ve been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

                              <span>Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

Developer Naughty Dog brought us back into the world of cordyceps, Fireflies, Ellie, and Joel alongside new threats and characters like the WLF, Abby, Yara, Lev, and more. Game Informer gave the game a 10 out of 10 – read the review here – and I would have agreed with that score in 2020. I still agree with that score today, too.
If I wrote what I want to say about The Last of Us Part II&#x27;s story, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find it very familiar because it&#x27;s largely how I felt around the game&#x27;s original release.

For those subscribers looking to add it to their library, or for non-subscribers looking to purchase the game outright, Foamstars launches exclusively on PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 6.


As for the game itself, Foamstars is a 4 vs. 4 online multiplayer game where players take on the role of the titular Fomastars of varying classes and abilities to participate in a game called Foamsmash. Rather than simply shooting your opponent, the goal is to coat them with enough foam so that you can slide-kick them to knock them out of the match. The foam also changes the layout of the arena by creating traversable hills and defensive walls, and you can move through your own foam faste…</span>

The &#x27;misunderstanding&#x27; was eventually resolved so to commemorate the comeback, FrostWire has just released a new update, dubbing it the “Ice Phoenix” release.

Jordon Longbottom faced a private criminal prosecution brought by the Federation Against Copyright Theft but avoided a custodial sentence after the case failed to be brought in a timely fashion. Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

Asgard’s Wrath 2 stands out in a sea of virtual reality titles available on the market today. As the showcase piece for the Meta Quest 3, this sequel offers an experience rarely seen in the category, weaving together an exciting blend of action, intricate puzzle design, and semi-open-world environments. With the clever use of VR mechanics, you discover new surprises even after playing for dozens of hours. Asgard’s Wrath 2 is a VR game that’s difficult to put down, even as the Quest 3’s battery life often requires you to. However, while it does star…</span>

                              <span>In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team&#x27;s dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can&#x27;t wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans&#x27; appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we&#x27;re excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner, hitting PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29. Game Informer has been covering it all month long as the game graced the cover of our latest magazine issue, and you can read all of our exclusive Final Fantasy VII Rebirth coverage here. But, with little over a month to go until the game&#x27;s release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this &quot;Destined for Rebirth&quot; trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game&#x27;s excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it&#x27;s pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth &quot;Destined for Rebirth&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PS5 on February 29, 2024.

                              <span>We’ve had barely an official word on Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree since it was announced about a year ago, itself a year after the release of From Software’s superb open-world soulslike. That hasn’t stopped a steady drip of decidedly unofficial rumours and signs about the Elden Ring expansion could arrive, though - and the latest indication is that Shadow of the Erdtree’s release date might be soon. Very soon, in fact.

                              <span>Hello folks. It&#x27;s probably officially too far into January to get away with saying Happy New Year now, but stuff it, I&#x27;ll wish you a good one anyway, as well as a warm welcome back to Letter From The Editor. This month&#x27;s letter can be considered very much a part two to the one I wrote in November, in which we had a sneaky peek at the behind the scenes process of putting together our annual RPS Advent Calendar (or in regular video game website speak, our big games of the year feature). 
We always have a big old voting barney around November time to decide which games do or don&#x27;t make the cut in our Advent Calendar (that is: we all submit top ten lists and we count up the votes afterwards), and every year lots of you try and guess which ones will make it over on the RPS Discord. Inevitably, there are only so many slots for what is always a heck of a lot of games put forward, but the key question has always been thus: who voted for what? WELL. For the first time ever, come and find out below as we reveal all.

                              <span>War Hospital, out now on Steam, is about subsisting on the periphery of a war and keeping it firmly off-screen by means of adept time management. Set in 1918, it puts you in charge of a field hospital in northern France, a few minutes drive from the frontline. Here’s how all that works: casualties arrive from the trenches by ambulance or stretcher, and are carried by your medics to a clearing station, where nurses look after them before they’re seen by a doctor. Patients may be lightly or severely injured, but they will all eventually die if they’re left unattended.

                              <span>First reported by MP1st, Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt mentioned a couple of cancelled projects on his Linkedin page. One was a live service version of Call Of Duty&#x27;s zombies mode, and the other, a revival of a classic Raven IP. I&#x27;m not sad about one and I&#x27;m mildly sad over the other, with the mystery not being too hard to solve.

                              <span>I mentioned this in a What Are We Playing? and the podcast last week, but I&#x27;ve been playing a point and click puzzle game called Twilight Oracle, which is out at the end of the month. It&#x27;s cool! It reminds me a lot of Legends Of Kyrandia, in that it doesn&#x27;t need to explain why stuff in the world is like it is, it just is. Big talking fish? Sure. Skull floating in space? You betcha.
Twilight Oracle isn&#x27;t immune to the kind of counter-intuitive puzzle solves that are sort of inherent to the genre (use pineapple on wallet, etc.), but there&#x27;s a demo to see for yourself, and I thought it&#x27;d be just as well to make more of you aware of it before it comes out on the 30th of January. Also because I wanted to point out that one of the reasons I have been enjoying Twilight Oracle is the colour.

Pick a squad of mechs to field in different scenarios where you must push, pull, and slam your way to victory. All of which will be so much easier if you rewrite the rules by shunting around syntax blocks. And yes, Baba is piloting a giant Baba-shaped mech.

                              <span>Given the sheer quantity of games releasing on Steam these days, having a neat little elevator pitch for your game can be vital in helping it stand out. For example, if I get an email saying a game is like &quot;Obra Dinn meets such and such&quot; or &quot;Into The Breach but a deckbuilder&quot;, that&#x27;s like personal catnip to me, and can be a handy indicator of whether I should investigate further - maybe watch a gameplay trailer for it, say, or see if it&#x27;s got a demo. Case in point: this is exactly how I stumbled upon the upcoming Donkey Kong Country-esque platformer Windswept last week, although instead of an email, I saw it on the growing &quot;Your game is too much like...&quot; thread over on Xwitter - which is definitely worth a browse if you have very niche interests in need of a good scratch.

                              <span>Do you like trapping innocent, extinct animals in diabolical, broken worlds of your own devising, miring them in a purgatory of genre comparisions from which they may never escape? Because Ark: Survival Ascended developers Studio Wildcard and Grove Street Games are promising/threatening to &quot;put the power of unbridled game creation directly in your hands&quot; with the game&#x27;s next major dev kit update, which will release by the end of January.
This will greatly expand the game&#x27;s moddability, though concrete details are thin on the ground. It&#x27;ll ship with a &quot;Mario-inspired&quot; platformer to show you how. There&#x27;s also a dev kit update planned next week for multiplayer spin-off Ark: The Survival Of The Fittest. This will allow you to &quot;sculpt the ultimate battlegrounds where your fellow ARK survivors will fight to see who will be the ultimate survivor&quot;.

                              <span>A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn&#x27;t have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn&#x27;t do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game&#x27;s logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is going to receive some changes designed to make teamwork easier, and to make bad teamwork less frustrating. The latter is more interesting, because one of Blizzard&#x27;s proposed solution is giving Tank and Damage heroes &quot;a modified, tuned-down version of the Support self-healing passive&quot;, which would make them less reliant on Support players to heal everyone.

I&#x27;ve got hills bookmarked from Tweedbank to Aviemore and by god, if snow falls near a train line and some trees, I&#x27;ll be right out there. And possibly stuck out there when the trains are cancelled. This winter has so far been miserable rather than cruel, and I crave the cruelty. Cleansing cruelty. Next week, I think next week will bring cruelty. Until then, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

There&#x27;s no release date for the sequel, but Titan Forge Games says it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Closed early alpha testing will begin this spring. 
The team says Smite 2 will feature a diverse roster of Gods from all sorts of mythological pantheons around the world, and while some playable gods will stay true to how they perform in Smite, others &quot;will have new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities.&quot;

Discord CEO Jason Citron cites overhiring, which has led to the company becoming &quot;less efficient&quot; in how it operates. The layoffs affected people across various departments. 
The Verge obtained an internal memo from Citron sent to employees announcing the layoffs, which have already happened. That memo explained why the layoffs were happening, when affected employees would receive the email telling them they no longer have a job, and follow-up meetings for those who remain at Discord. 
&quot;We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,&quot; Citron writes in the memo. &quot;As a result, we took on more projects and became le…</span>

                              <span>Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need.

Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


&quot;From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks.&quot; 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you&#x27;d like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you&#x27;re curious about that library, here&#x27;s every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription.

                              <span>11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations recently released an update that apparently introduced DRM, only to swiftly roll back the patch after complaints from players that it reportedly caused performance issues. Capcom aren’t giving up that easily on their vow to crack down on mods, though.

                              <span>It’s been almost seven years since Danganronpa V3 brought a close to the trilogy of gloriously twisted murder-mystery visual novels. With several of the series’ biggest names going on to release their next game as an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch, there’s room for a properly good successor on PC. Or why not successors? Last year’s exceptional Paranormasight is definitely in the running, and 2024 is already looking promising thanks to the reveal of Kumitantei: Old-School Slaughter.

The same seems true for Reigns: Three Kingdoms, the latest in the decision-making story series, which arrived on PC (and Switch) yesterday after a year exclusive to Netflix&#x27;s inexplicable library of mobile games. Once again, you will decide the fate of a kingdom (this time, China) by swiping left or right on binary decisions. Unfortunately, you cannot cheatily flick through to interesting parts nor use your finger as a bookmark. Not even if you jam it into a USB port. I did try.

                              <span>Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk is a combination of words that screams &quot;predatory mobile fantasy RPG&quot; but that&#x27;s very much not my takeaway from the game&#x27;s demo. Out tomorrow on Steam for £10.23, $11.99 or €11.83 including the 20% launch discount, this first instalment in the Crystal Story series blends the cuddly feel of a 16-bit Zelda with the dream logic of a Yume Nikki. There&#x27;s a splash of Undertale&#x27;s crackpot experimentalism to the writing and certain battles, as well. 


Those are big comparisons to invoke, and I don&#x27;t expect Crystal Story to measure up to them. But it&#x27;s a lot better than I was expecting from a game whose title had me picturing microtransaction-sodden levelling systems and a pouty elf in a bikini.

It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she&#x27;s ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat&#x27;s Velvetiser, you&#x27;re an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It&#x27;s fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.
Bad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games&#x27; new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?

                              <span>Kainga Colon Seeds of Civilization is one of many, many games that I didn&#x27;t get on with for some reason or other in early access, and has subsequently sat in my pile long past a 1.0 release, neglected and generating a vague guilt. It&#x27;s come some way since, but its edges are still a little rough, with (usually) minor bugs and limited feedback wrapped up in a design that&#x27;s influenced, of course, by that vague shimmering ghost of Rogue (and thus is innately bad and you&#x27;re all just wrong). So yeah, it kinda has problems.
But I like it. Weird, huh?

In a lengthy discussion of the latter game, the two Yoshidas chew over the familiar topic of where Final Fantasy should go next. According to Naoki Yoshida, it might be time for an injection of new blood.

                              <span>CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.
Mercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to &quot;Is this a good idea?&quot; followed by &quot;No.&quot;

                              <span>In addition to resolutions, new years are always good times to start thinking about the futureeeee, with or without a wibbly oooOOOoooOoooOh intonation. Predictions about what&#x27;s going to happen over the next 12 months abound, some of which are more spurious (and light-hearted) than others. But such near-sightedness is not what we&#x27;re concerning ourselves with today in this latest edition of Ask RPS. We&#x27;re looking much further ahead, thanks to this excellent question from MiniMatt. 
They ask: &quot;Dearest RPS, This being your 150th year in PC gaming [Ed: this question was submitted in 2023], please tell us what the next 150 years hold? Will VR become universal? Will the desktop PC box survive or will we all move over to laptops &amp; steam decks? Will industry continue to consolidate or fragment? Get yer nostradamus on and tell us Peter Molyneux&#x27;s future. 
Indeed, a lot has changed in the world of PC gaming since our esteemed founding in 1873, so come and find out our best guesses for what the future holds below.

It&#x27;s out 26th April 2024, and alternates beat &#x27;em up action with cartoon tank customisation, in a sort of Dragon Ball X Mad Max homage with chunks of Dragon Quest thrown in for good measure.

                              <span>Core Engage and Daedalic Entertainment have released a new overview trailer for New Cycle, their post-apocalyptic &quot;dieselpunk&quot; city management game. &quot;New Cycle&quot; is obviously a bit of a self-contradiction, and I suspect that&#x27;s deliberate - one of the questions the video leaves you with is whether there is &quot;a future beyond survival&quot;, or whether we are doomed to just repeat the processes of extraction and gradual building-up, resource overexploitation and encroaching disaster suggested by these 12 jam-packed minutes of in-game footage.

                              <span>Choosing the lowest storage capacity Steam Deck or other PC gaming handheld then upgrading to a high-capacity SSD is often cheaper than choosing the highest-tier storage option out of the gate, and can even provide better performance too. 
If that makes sense to you, we spotted a 10% discount on the WD SN740, a solid PCIe 4.0 option that works well in the Steam Deck and even better in the ROG Ally, Legion Go and MSI Claw gaming handhelds that support faster PCIe 4.0 speeds. After the discount at Scan in the UK, the SN740 is available for £81 for 1TB.

                              <span>Lexar&#x27;s Play Micro SD cards are some of the most affordable 1TB memory cards you can buy, and now you can pick up one for just £67.85 - within £3 of the cheapest price ever recorded for this model, which was during Black Friday last year. 
These cards are rated for up to 150MB/s reads and have both UHS Speed Class 3 (3) and App Performance Class 2 (A2) certifications for minimum speeds, making them a decent choice for Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go owners amongst other use cases in phones, cameras and more.

                              <span>It took all of one turn before the insults started flying in our Solium Infernum multiplayer preview session this week. Specifically, they&#x27;d been launched straight into the court of League Of Geeks co-founder and studio director Trent Kusters, who was attempting to show us how the game&#x27;s asynchronous multiplayer mode worked in a six-player match-up - the public playtest for which goes live today, Thursday January 11th, over on Steam. Moments earlier, he&#x27;d been walking myself, deputy editor Alice Bee and guides editor Ollie through the basics of this strategy game from hell, telling us about the importance of claiming territory, seeking out places of power to bolster our domain, and how to do battle with our hive-like legion units. But just as we were watching our individual turn orders play out, Kusters announced that Ollie had given him the digital equivalent of a demonic slap in the face, demanding he pay tribute to him, or else…
To his credit, Kusters took it with good humour. &quot;This is the beautiful thing about this game - it&#x27;s petty high school politics in Hell,&quot; he said laughing before graciously deciding to accept the insult at the cost of some of his prestige - the all-important hallmark of how you&#x27;re perceived within this conclave of warring demons fighting for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. Personally, I think Ollie&#x27;s insult would have pierced my exceedingly thin skin instantly if I&#x27;d been in the same position, and I&#x27;d probably have been torn between declaring a vendetta against Ollie&#x27;s unjustified affront, or challenging him to a Praetor duel to exact some (hopefully) righteous vengeance. Alas, since we were literally only a turn into this game, none of us were in any position to make good on those options, leaving the only possible outcome as eating it and moving on. It was a smart move on Ollie&#x27;s part, and one that makes me both terrified and excited to see how our own team multiplayer sessions will play out in the run-up to Solium Infernum&#x27;s full release on February 14th.

The events of the next 10 days show that by selecting the &#x27;wrong&#x27; target, freshly motivated pirates boost their engagement and content-neutral apps like Tachiyomi reap the benefits.

                              <span>Measures in the UK&#x27;s Criminal Justice Bill currently range from criminalizing the homeless in the event their &quot;rough sleeping&quot; is deemed a nuisance, to outlawing 3D printer firearms templates. Also likely to be approved are provisions to suspend domain names and IP addresses when used for serious criminal purposes. The reframing of copyright infringement as fraud in recent years means that pirate sites may find themselves vulnerable.

Peter Anvin napsal dlouhý příspěvek o tom, že by to nemusel být špatný nápad, šlo by se například zbavit složitých maker a vloženého assembleru.</span>

                              <span>There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed &quot;AI Shark,&quot; it&#x27;s now a software-agnostic program designed to provide &quot;personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming.&quot; What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It&#x27;s all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
&quot;The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024.&quot;
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console&#x27;s release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo&#x27;s response, assuming it issues one.

Shannon Woodward, the actress who originally portrayed Dina in The Last of Us Part 2, has responded to the live-action casting of Isabela Merced. In addition to a tweet of general support for Merced, Woodward responded to a fan who wondered why she didn&#x27;t reprise her role in the sequel. In short, it&#x27;s because of her age.
Bcs I am…. Much older lol https://t.co/4Qe2SjnAiQ

&quot;Bcs [sic] I am... Much older lol,&quot; Woodward&#x27;s second tweet reads. Much like Ellie&#x27;s original actress, Ashley Johnson, Woodward is about 20 years older than the character she portrays. Dina&#x27;s character model is actually based on an entirely different person, Cascina Caradonna, who fits the age range of the character. That said, Joel&#x27;s video game actor Troy Baker, along with Johnson, recei…</span>

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a triumphant and impressive return for Ubisoft&#x27;s thought-dead platforming franchise. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review by following the link, but that review pertains to the console version of the game and does not address a question many players have: how is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Switch? The short answer is that it is solid. Playing on Switch does not feel like a major downgrade from the other versions. For the long answer, check out the video below!

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to pu…</span>

                              <span>Paramount+ released the first season of its live-action Halo series back in 2022 and while the initial premiere showed promise, the show was ultimately a letdown, both as the Chief&#x27;s first foray into the live-action television space and as a Halo story. Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. 
I&#x27;m not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn&#x27;t even finish the first season – but I&#x27;d be lying if I said this trailer didn&#x27;t pique my interest. Perhaps I&#x27;m a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it&#x27;s a combination of both. 
Check out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: 


Paramount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show&#x27;s first season, so it&#x27;s clear the streamer is committed to this property for now. Here&#x27;s hoping the second season fairs better than the first. 
For more, read about Halo: The Series&#x27; showrunner&#x27;s decision to show Master Chief&#x27;s face in the show, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Halo Infinite review. After that, check out this story about how Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries will develop Halo games &quot;now and in the future&quot; even after layoffs that happened at the studio last year.

Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 
Basically, it&#x27;s the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It&#x27;s an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022.

                              <span>A retailer listing of a &quot;V2 DualSense&quot; controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an &quot;exceptional&quot; 12-hour battery life. That&#x27;s a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 
More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a &quot;PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White,&quot; as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the &quot;About This Product&quot; section of the controller, you&#x27;ll find, &quot;Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions.&quot; This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that &quot;offers easy click-in charging.&quot; 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it&#x27;s real, and will update this story if it learns more. 
If you&#x27;re interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge. And if you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it might be like to have a DualSense controller cut in half with a screen placed between the two halves, check out the PlayStation Portal.

It&#x27;s good news for people playing the FromSoftware RPG on Steam Decks, especially those haunted by memories of the game&#x27;s technical tribulations at launch, some of which were caused by the anti-cheat functionality. It&#x27;s less great news for the millions hankering for the slightest whisper of new information about Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. But save your pity, above all, for the dozens of videogame news writers - dozens, I tell you! - who must write about Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC at any opportunity, lest the demigods of traffic eat our souls.

                              <span>As Prince Of Persia subtitles go, The Lost Crown is certainly an evocative one. It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They&#x27;re all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I&#x27;d also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you&#x27;ll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you&#x27;re allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that&#x27;s precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios&#x27; pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.

                              <span>New year, same us! The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns and kicks off the new year with a look forward at what 2024 may bring. We chat about our most anticipated video games that may or may not be arriving this year, including some racing, some spac(marine)ing and some book selling. Also some freezing and some despairing (at BioWare and Bloodlines 2, potentially). Plus: Nate and James have an anecdote off, which makes me lose my mind and become a horrible person for about four solid minutes. I have apologised, and me and James are still friends.

                              <span>I reached the Elden Ring exhaustion point a couple of years ago… and I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve climbed out of my slump. Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it&#x27;s one of FromSoftware&#x27;s most taxing soulslike creations. It&#x27;s so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I&#x27;d had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.
With talk of Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I&#x27;ve assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m not as excited as I would&#x27;ve been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.

                              <span>It’s time for another pull on the velvet rope labelled “too many games”. In fairness, this time the argument is a touch more involved than perennial moaning about backlogs – to whit, “there are too many games and it’s all the pandemic’s fault”. Nacon’s head of publishing Benoit Clerc has argued that the Covid lockdown years have bred too much investment in new games, and that we’re currently reaping the results in the form of an unsustainable glut of releases.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve written about this somewhere already - I may have expressed it to a therapist - but when I was a lad, I had a recurring nightmare about a place called Snake World. It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.
Fortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up. It doesn&#x27;t look like this will be an effective gambit in Digested, a bodycam horror game about being stuck on a barren, thinly forested and possibly irradiated island with a giant snake. Your tactical options seem to consist mostly here of running away.

                              <span>Remember Suika Game? The charming puzzler blew up late last year thanks to its engrossing fruit-merging gameplay and colourful theme (and the help of a load of vtubers to boot). While the original was only on Nintendo Switch - although technically even that was a port of a game included on a projector, of all things - plenty of Suika clones quickly emerged to fill its watermelon-shaped hole on PC. The latest Suika-like is stepping things up another level by taking its chill combo-a-thon to a galactic scale with colliding planets and suns.

                              <span>Major actors’ union SAG-AFTRA have raised hackles among a number of voice game performers after striking a deal with a company that wants to create AI replicas of actors’ voices for use in games, among other things. While the union claim that their agreement with Replica will allow for a “fair” and “ethical” approach to creating AI voices, it’s clear that a number of actors with credits in games from Baldur’s Gate 3, Mortal Kombat and Starfield to Apex Legends, World of Warcraft and Genshin Impact don’t agree.

It&#x27;s £100 off today, making the price of admission to the really big monitor show just £699. For about twice the price of a good 1440p 165Hz monitor, you get a monitor the size of two 1440p 165Hz monitors - but, critically, with no gap in the middle.

                              <span>Earlier this week, I shared a Tweet, or X post or whatever, that was a Twitter Film Guy being like, &quot;It&#x27;s a burden talking to people about my passion, movies, because I think about them on a fundamentally different level&quot;. Like, okay, Scorsese, you can say you didn&#x27;t really like Murder Mystery 2, the normies won&#x27;t chase you out of town with pitchforks. You know what actually is a burden? Your passions being watching hours of anti-multi-level marketing (MLM) YouTube videos, which is the content hole I fell down over the Christmas break. Your weird uncles have at least seen a film before, but it&#x27;s not like I can turn to my mum and ask her if she thinks the weird Monat Christians are worse than the Seint make-up TikTok girlies without explaining almost every word in the sentence.
Anyway. My point is: someone should make an MLM simulation game.

                              <span>In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. 


Warp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that Viscera Cleanup Detail&#x27;s Sniffer tool is better than a fresh new MMO server. This was a close win, 54% vs 46%, but know we now how we&#x27;re entering the new year: equipped to track down the sources of our problems, rather than running away from them. With that resolved, it&#x27;s time to get snarky. A real snark-off. So much snark, and so many snarks, and so much potential to be undone by the hubris of miscalculating snark. What&#x27;s better: Half-Life&#x27;s Snarks or Planescape: Torment&#x27;s Litany Of Curses?

The game&#x27;s user reviews are Mostly Negative, three months after release, with complaints covering a wide gamut: the online being full of cheaters, the single player being boring, and the game being poorly optimised for PC.

                              <span>Little-known indie platform holder Valve have announced a new policy for Steam releases that make use of &quot;AI&quot; technology. To boil it down, developers will now have to disclose how they&#x27;re using AI tools on Steam pages, including what &quot;guardrails&quot; they&#x27;re putting in place for live-generated stuff that might be illegal or infringe on copyright. Valve are also introducing a new player reporting system for breaches. The company say these adjustments &quot;will enable us to release the vast majority of games that use AI&quot;, with the exception of Adult Only Sexual content that is generated live.

Its developers said they would and now we get to see what that means when the update launches on January 16th.

While these actions have an effect, they couldn&#x27;t prevent a resurgence in DMCA takedown notices over the past year. The search engine is now processing an average of 1.6 billion removal requests per year, mostly driven by publishers.

                              <span>Police in Vietnam say they have arrested three people behind at least three websites that offered pirated movies and anime content for online streaming. It&#x27;s claimed that the alleged 30-year-old ringleader launched the operation in 2019 and was assisted by people he recruited online. Action of this type is rare in Vietnam and may offer Hollywood a glimmer of hope that a wider crackdown sits somewhere on the horizon.

                              <span>Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us&#x27; second season. This follows yesterday&#x27;s news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show&#x27;s second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix&#x27;s Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for &quot;Snooze&quot; by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity&#x27;s Triump, and Good Boy. 
We&#x27;re so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can&#x27;t wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren&#x27;t alone either – The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark&#x27;s upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It&#x27;s a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark&#x27;s chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

The company announced these layoffs in an internal memo sent out on Monday, January 8. These job cuts follow a turbulent 2023 for the company after it attempted to introduce per-install fees to developers using its game engine before later walking it back. 
Unity is expected to lay off 1800 people by the end of March and once complete, it will be the company&#x27;s largest round of layoffs ever. It will be its fourth round of layoffs since July 2022, as noted by Yahoo! Finance. The job cuts are expected to affect all departments at Unity.

Unfortunately, it seems this heartbreaking trend is continuing into this new year as yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Amazon-owned streaming company Twitch is set to lay off 500 employees, or about 35 percent of its staff. 
These layoffs follow two rounds of layoffs Twitch experienced last year. Bloomberg expects the layoffs to be announced today. As for why, the publication says running Twitch is extremely expensive and the company has struggled to financially get on top of the cost to support billions of hours of livestreamed content.

                              <span>Last September, SAG-AFTRA union members voted yes to authorize a video game strike. Reasons why included a desire for better wages, increased safety precautions, and protections around exploitative uses of artificial intelligence. Now, just a few months later, SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with Replica Studios, an A.I. voice technology company, to allow game developers to use A.I. voices, as reported by Game Developer. 
Various video game voice actors, like Yong Yea, the new English voice of Kazuma Kiryu in the Like a Dragon series, have publicly stated that they and other actors they know were not aware of this. &quot;Every voice actor I know not only didn&#x27;t approve this,&quot; Yea writes in a tweet. &quot;[They] pretty much heard about this for the first time today on Twitter.&quot;

Now it&#x27;s taking the bold step of moving beyond meme by becoming a playable video game, when it launches on January 19th.

Most excitingly, that&#x27;ll include an update from MachineGames on their in-development Indiana Jones game.

                              <span>When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It&#x27;s also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

                              <span>I will not lie to you, reader, I used up about 95% of today&#x27;s remaining creative energy/caffeine on that headline joke, but let&#x27;s charge our flashlights, sharpen our hooks and struggle on through the body copy anyway. Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game&#x27;s villainous Entity.
Mind you, I&#x27;m a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight&#x27;s universe, not Behaviour Interactive. &quot;As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back,&quot; it reads. &quot;Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key.&quot; Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

                              <span>Corsair&#x27;s RM1000x Shift power supply is quite a tempting one for any PC build, providing 1000W of power at 80+ Gold efficiency - but the best feature here is its conveniently reachable side-mounted connector placement. Corsair charges a premium for this feature, with the PSU normally going for £160, but today you can pick up a refurbished unit from Scan in the UK for just £110. That&#x27;s a sizeable savings and well worth considering.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever been to Shinjuku station in Japan, you know what it&#x27;s like to be transported to a dizzying realm of limbs and tickets and signage with myriad squiggly lines that make about as much sense as rainbow spaghetti that&#x27;s been hurled at a white rectangle. You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I&#x27;d say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

                              <span>Acts! It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre&#x27;s underpants. One act isn&#x27;t the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which many players feel isn&#x27;t a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG&#x27;s first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act&#x27;s &quot;drastic&quot; tone shift better in future releases. It&#x27;s a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian&#x27;s CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he&#x27;s &quot;figured out&quot; the first act of Larian&#x27;s next unannounced project.

                              <span>It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon&#x27;s secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

                              <span>I have a sneaking affection for slightly jarring genre hybrids - games like the relatively recent Disintegration and the much older Battlezone 2, which smush action mechanics together with real-time strategy, or the rather more elegant Puzzle Quest, in which you roll around a parchment landscape fighting wizards using the power of match-3. New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You&#x27;ll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

The Claw – great name, by the way – actually looks and sounds closer to the Asus ROG Ally than Valve’s handheld, being a Windows 11-based device without any flashy hardware tricks like the Lenovo Legion Go’s detachable controllers. All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.

A pirate site blocking order obtained by the studios of the MPA in India encapsulates the incremental steps taken in recent years. The end result is so expansive that almost any site offering the studios&#x27; content, even that yet to be made, could face perpetual domain name suspensions. No matter where they are in the world.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation&#x27;s Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019&#x27;s Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We&#x27;re thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!

Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it&#x27;s fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game&#x27;s story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory&#x27;s Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It&#x27;s unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.</span>

                              <span>Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.</span>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League exists at a strange intersection of gaming hype. On the one hand, obviously, we are and should be excited for Rocksteady&#x27;s return to the Arkham Universe that it popularized through some of the greatest superhero games of all time. Obviously. But on the other hand, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deviates from so many of the conventions that made Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight so beloved. And so many of those conventions that Kill the Justice League embraces – such as a team-based, co-op inf…</span>

                              <span>Among the slew of reveals for Final Fantasy XIV during Fan Fest Tokyo last weekend was a new town players will visit during upcoming expansion Dawntrail. While a new corner of Eorzea to explore is exciting by itself, the cyberpunk city has added to my hope that the MMO is set to shower a bit more love on the best Final Fantasy game. That’s right: Final Fantasy IX.

                              <span>If you’re like me, you probably have at least one treasured memory of being allowed to play an edutainment game at school under the guise of learning. What a blast, getting to play video games at school! For me, it was a floppy disk with a bizarre Pac-Man clone where you had to answer maths questions every time you ran into an enemy or obstacle. I’m sure for others it might be unforgiving classic Oregon Trail or globetrotting trivia quiz Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

Meanwhile, we now know that the MMO&#x27;s second limited job will be the Beastmaster.

                              <span>Building a small form factor PC is difficult. Not only do you have to find the perfect SFF case, but then you have to spec out all of the components to fit inside it - and miniaturised motherboards in particular often come at a premium, especially if you&#x27;re building a current-gen system. 
Thankfully, right now Amazon UK is doing a great deal on ASRock&#x27;s best Mini ITX motherboard for Ryzen 7000 CPUs, with a £146 asking price that comes 20% below its £187 RRP and more than £20 cheaper than the next-closest UK retailer.

In my case, that job sim  is Medieval Machines Builder, probably better known as Siege Weapon Builder.
Its free-to-play prologue goes live later this week, on top of a demo from last year. I haven&#x27;t played either the prologue or the demo and who knows, they could be rubbish, but look, I had to spend three hours this morning queuing for an appointment, and all I wanted to do during those three hours was cobble together a trebuchet from plastic chairs and retractable tape. Let me do a quick 400 words on this? Pretty please?

                              <span>The ground beneath Square Enix&#x27;s Tetsuya Nomura&#x27;s feet trembled. In his time since serving as character designer and visual director on Final Fantasy VII, his legend has grown substantially. In addition to working on nearly every acclaimed Final Fantasy game since Nomura also helped create the Kingdom Hearts series and has become a figurehead and luminary within the stacked ranks of Square Enix&#x27;s stable of developers. But this 2015 trip to Los Angeles, California, was different.
PlayStation&#x27;s E3 2015 livestream had just revealed a teaser trailer featuring the iconic Final Fantasy VII protagonist, Cloud Strife, walking through Midgar in glorious, modern, HD graphics. The dream of so many – a remake of the classic RPG – was finally realized. The fans weren&#x27;t the only ones feeling the weight …</span>

                              <span>Since its release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last February, developer Avalanche&#x27;s Hogwarts Legacy has continued to sell well. It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at Variety with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. 
Haddad told Variety that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it&#x27;s the best-selling game of the year &quot;in the entire industry worldwide.&quot; Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release.

                              <span>The virtual reality market, while not as niche as it was years ago, is still a relatively small one. Even Sony&#x27;s PlayStation VR2 launch last year seemed to come and go with little fanfare (and even less support for the platform nearly a year later). However, tech giant Apple is making its own case for VR and it&#x27;s doing so with the $3,500 Vision Pro headset launching next month. 
While we&#x27;ve known about the headset and its, frankly, absurd price since last year, today, the company announced that preorders for it will begin on Friday, January 19, with a launch on February 2.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Square Enix revealed new information about Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV’s upcoming fifth expansion, during a fan event for the popular MMO. In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:


A new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.


Lastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. 


Last year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer. For more info, check out this primer breaking down everything you need to know about the expansion.</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We&#x27;re curious to see how the series follows up Season 1&#x27;s dramatic conclusion. Season 2&#x27;s cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.</span>
