                              <span>Among the Stars stole my heart the second its trailer aired during Summer Game Fest 2024. With an art style inspired by Studio Ghibli and a story that reflects the struggles of indigenous people, this 2-D action-adventure game has earned a spot on my &quot;games I want to play&quot; list.


Developed by Split Studio, Among the Stars tells the story of Ari and Tai, two sisters separated after armed land developers lay siege to their home in Brazil&#x27;s Pantanal region. With Ari lost in a jungle inhabited by nature spirits and Tai stranded deep in territory occupied by the murderous invaders, the sisters embark on a perilous journey to reunite and liberate their homeland before it&#x27;s too late.

                              <span>With the Viper Commandos Warbond announcement for Helldivers 2, developer Arrowhead Game Studios explained that future Warbonds would be more focused on a theme. Of course, what this community heard is that a medieval knight Warbond would be amazing, and now it&#x27;s all it can talk about. 


I have to say, I was also pretty thrilled when the developer confirmed it would be tightening the theme of Warbonds. all the ones leading up to Viper Commandos have felt like they&#x27;ve had armor that matches the theme, but everything else was kind of thrown into them randomly from whatever new items were working. I can&#x27;t even find a fault with the idea of a medieval knight Warbond because the suggestions fans have made for items are fantastic.

What was essentially a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation of remade levels from throughout Sonic&#x27;s history to serve as a celebration of the Blue Blur&#x27;s 20th anniversary is being remastered for current technology, but that&#x27;s not all: As part of the package, players can engage in a standalone campaign starring Shadow.

Fans are excited to see this part of the game be reworked, as it quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the original Persona 3 release. Many players have criticized the pacing of the story, as well as the overall difficulty spike of the original version of The Answer included with Persona 3 FES. 




While The Answer was a controversial release, that didn&#x27;t stop hungry fans from asking about it when Persona 3 Reload was first announced. Many assumed that the DLC would be missing f…</span>

But there&#x27;s a bit of a stink in the air surrounding the game, and it seems like this modern take on one of the most influential horror releases ever is going to have to be pretty much perfect.


In the current era of remakes, remasters, and re-imaginings, it can be easy to feel a little bogged down by an industry that&#x27;s too eager to tick the nostalgia box rather than deliver something fresh. However, a quick look at games like Resident Evil 4, Dead Space, Final Fantasy 7, and the work Nightdive Studios has been doing on classics like Quake 2 shows there&#x27;s stil…</span>

Those were already historic numbers for such a novelty title, but things have gotten even more out of hand, as the Banana invasion has just crossed over the 142,000-player mark.

&quot;Dot and Bubble&quot; is set on the planet of Finetime, which is entirely populated by rich, white, young adults aged between 17 and 27. Over the course of the episode, we are introduced to Lindy Pepper-Bean, played by Callie Cooke, who is the main ‘heroine’ of the story and must use the Doctor and Ruby’s advice to save herself from people-eating slugs. 


Lindy begins the episode, as do all of the residents of Finetime, stuck in a very literal bubble of social media. Imagine living inside TikTok, with all of your human contact only being done through video calls and short blogs. Lindy is enti…</span>

                              <span>After launching a free update with an orchestrated soundtrack and more in March, Slay the Princess is getting ready to introduce even more content. Cue Slay the Princess: The Pristine Cut, billed as the definitive edition and due out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this fall. 


According to publisher Serenity Forge, the new stuff adds up to &quot;over 35 percent more content overall.&quot; Additions include three new chapters, expansions that introduce changes to familiar routes, new princesses, and a completely new ending. Those route expansions have more than doubled the length of The Den, The Apotheosis, and The Fury.


There&#x27;s also a gallery for reliving everything from your greatest victories to your darkest deaths, as well as over 2,500 newly voiced lines by Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight and over 1,200 more of Abby Howard&#x27;s hand-drawn frames. 




With the new version comes some new physical releases for PlayStation 5 and Switch. The standard edition, pictured below, packs a copy of the game with a sticker sheet and a card to download the original soundtrack.

The real whopper is the Slay the Princess: The Pristine Cut Collector&#x27;s Edition, which includes all the standard edition content and much more. It includes a knife emblem bookmark, acrylic standee, reflective lenticular and mirror sticker sheet, severed arm enamel pin, illusion keychain, and the centerpiece: a seven-inch Princess Statue.

Even with all these changes, don&#x27;t forget that you still gotta slay that princess. Get to it.

                              <span>During the Wholesome Direct stream today, Krillbite Studio announced that their cute take on food truck employment now has a release window. Fruitbus is currently planned for release on PC sometime in October 2024.


Fruitbus grabbed my attention last year when it was announced. I really love the idea of a food truck simulation game, but the actual Food Truck Simulator was a catastrophic disappointment. Fruitbus is very similar conceptually, as you drive around in a food truck, park it in a good spot, and then cook and serve food. The big difference is that Fruitbus has a much cuter take on the profession.




There was a demo released shortly after its announcement. I dove into it but found it mainly functioned as a proof of concept. The basic mechanics were there, but it needed a lot more work to tie it together. A lot more work has no doubt been done at this point, so I’m looking forward to trying it out again.


Of note was the fact that the world was somewhat bland outside of towns. One of the mechanics has you journey into the wilderness to acquire new ingredients, and the lack of liveliness in the world made this more of a chore than it has to be. There were other areas that needed to be tightened, but I don’t remember them all. This was nearly a year ago and probably an early build. Since then, the demo has been updated a few times (most recently a completely new build in March), but I decided I’d probably wait until closer to release to try again.


It’s still a few months off, but at least I know where I should be clearing my schedule. If you’re interested in taking Fruitbus for a spin, there’s a demo available now.


Fruitbus will be available for PC this October, 2024.

                              <span>Life is scary, and times are tough. For that reason, not everyone wants to read a big, grimdark fantasy series. Sometimes, something a little happier is just what the doctor ordered.


Cozy fantasy has exploded over the past few years, giving fans a happier way to experience the genre they love. Sometimes the setting is just simple and happy. Sometimes it takes place in a high fantasy world, but far away from the darkness where a normal story would be told. However it frames it, cozy fantasy is making itself known all over.


Feel like reading something a bit brighter? Never heard of cozy fantasy and want to give it a try? For every type of fan, here are some great cozy fantasy options to keep you warm, even when the summer sun has fallen far below the horizon.

                              <span>Becoming strong in My Hero Academia is more than just being blessed with a powerful Quirk. Having mastery over said Quirk is far more important, and Mirio Togata is a prime example of that. After all, the dude started as a wimp whose Quirk is more of a liability than a curse. But through sheer grit and effort, he ultimately became U.A.&#x27;s top student.


While all that talk is inspiring and cheesy, it also doesn&#x27;t change the fact that a powerful Quirk is, well, powerful. Mastery is indeed important as most Quirks have drawbacks, but a mediocre Quirk can only bring you to a certain height. And in my opinion, here are the ten strongest Quirks.

                              <span>Way back in 1990, Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza created a brand new character for the ever-expanding Marvel Comics universe. The mercenary named Wade Wilson, better known by the alias Deadpool made his introduction in the pages of The New Mutants #98. Little did anyone realize then how much of a global phenomenon this character would become in only a few short years.


Plenty of quips, fourth wall breaks, and astounding comic book moments later, Deadpool has become one of the most popular Marvel creations of all time. His crude humor and willingness to poke fun at just about anything has endeared him to generations of comic readers, in addition to those who don&#x27;t read so often. Merchandise, cartoons, and movies, such as the highly anticipated Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, set to release on July 2…</span>

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked was off to a rough start as many players felt alienated by the bigger focus on vehicular combat. Things got even worse when some players began wondering if premium cars offered more advantages than free ones, and someone proved the doubts right.


Credit for the discovery goes to Tiktoker Nickeh30, who easily proves in the video below that some of the cars you can only get by spending V-bucks offer much greater protection to their drivers:




Even though this doesn&#x27;t apply to every single one of the premium cars at your disposal, it&#x27;s still a problem because Epic states that paid cosmetic skins that offer actual gameplay advantages go directly against the company&#x27;s policy. The company quickly addressed the situation by admitting that the issue exists and stating that it&#x27;s working on fixes that will begin rolling out with the upcoming updates.




Interestingly, The unfair advantages present in premium cars don&#x27;t come from better stats resulting from secret codes that the company put there just to benefit the rich. They come from these cars&#x27; more extravagant design that features smaller windshields and leave the drivers way more protected. It seems like this was but one of the many untold side benefits of being rich. 


You&#x27;d think that a car design inspired by Lamborghini wouldn&#x27;t be the best choice for a road trip on the Wasteland, but these things have proven time and time again that they&#x27;re somehow capable of adapting to any situation.




For better or for worse, you can now enjoy Fortnite&#x27;s Mad Max-inspired new season on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

                              <span>As with any trading card game, Disney Lorcana has multiple rarities of cards that influence market prices. This impacts both players and collectors alike. But unlike its siblings within the genre, Lorcana treats its rarest cards much differently. 


In other games, such as Magic: The Gathering, high prices prevent less fortunate players from being able to use the strongest cards found in the game. Lorcana’s rarest cards are known as Enchanted cards and are higher-quality prints of existing cards found within each set. This allows collectors and pack openers to have beautiful, high-value cards to chase after while enabling players to be able to utilize the more practical, albeit less rare versions of the same card.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over 10 years since Bit Kid successfully crowdfunded Chasm and nearly six since it fully launched. Now the developer is ready to return to the Metroidvania genre, this time ditching procedural generation in favor of the gnarly, intricately-designed world of WOLFHOUND.


There&#x27;s no release date in place yet, but WOLFHOUND is in the works for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam). You can see what Bit Kid is going for with this one in the announcement trailer below.




Set in 1944, WOLFHOUND sees the appropriately grizzled Capt. Chuck &quot;WOLFHOUND&quot; Rossetti attempting to infiltrate a Nazi base hidden in the Bermuda Triangle. Naturally, that means he&#x27;ll run into a number of monstrous creatures during his mission as he scavenges for weapons and ammo and ventures deeper into the heart of a greater mystery.


Back to basics

The visuals immediately stand out, and not just because of some great character animation. Check out that tile arrangement, which manages to look mismatched and hectic in a way that works and feels authentic. That authenticity is one of the key aspects driving the aesthetic. Bit Kid founder and lead developer James Petruzzi said he wanted to &quot;dive deep into the style of NES and 8-bit gaming&quot; with this one. While this isn&#x27;t exactly something you could ever get running on an original console, WOLFHOUND adheres to an 8-bit color palette and 320x180 pixel resolution. 


Some of the artistic talent reeling in all those pixel art explosions and viscera have previously worked on games like Freedom Planet 2, Sparklite, and the Shantae series. In a similarly legitimate vein, the soundtrack was composed in Famitracker, featuring the chiptune earworms of RushJet1 (Alwa&#x27;s Legacy, Cave Story+). It all swirls together for a run-and-gun concoction I very much want to play right now, so hopefully, we won&#x27;t be waiting too long.

Which configuration is better for Echoes in Wuthering Waves: &#x27;4,3,3,1,1&#x27; or &#x27;4,4,1,1,1&#x27;?


Regarding total stat gains, &#x27;4,3,3,1,1&#x27; is completely superior to &#x27;4,4,1,1,1&#x27; thanks to the inclusion of more high-ranked Echoes. Echoes with higher loadout costs come with a main stat that provides more overall of the main stat. Despite this, both setups are actually viable for current content in Wuthering Waves, but there are times when you might consider using &#x27;4,4,1,1,1&#x27; over the superior one.

                              <span>Some of the most menacing enemies in Fallout games are small critters scaled up to human-sized proportions. A disturbing example of this are the Gulpers of Fallout 76 who were once cute salamanders until the Great War mutated them into six-foot-tall predators of the Wasteland. Flies and other insects aren’t enough to sate their appetite anymore so Gulpers have adapted to ambushing players around the Mire and Cranberry Bog. 


If you’re looking to defeat Gulpers for Seasonal Challenges or harvest their meat to make delicious pepperoni rolls, you’ll want to know all of the locations Gulpers are found within Fallout 76.

                              <span>Sethos is an Electro Bow user with two distinct playstyles. Once you’ve leveled him up, you’ll need to choose how you want to play him. Here’s a breakdown of both his Normal Attack and Charged Attack playstyles so you can pick which one works for you!


As a general overview, Normal Attack Sethos is easier to play, while Charged Attack Sethos is more unique and fun. Both are capable of decent damage, so try both and see which one you prefer! In either case, Sethos’ build will remain the same.


Normal Attack Sethos


Normal Attack Sethos is the easier, more straightforward playstyle. This playstyle relies on casting Sethos’ Burst to infuse his Normal Attacks with Electro for a short duration. For Normal Attack Sethos, his rotation will look something like this:

                              <span>Destiny 2 developer Bungie has been watching the race for world first in Salvation&#x27;s Edge more closely than any fans. While it took roughly 20 hours for a team to finally beat it, Bungie has confirmed that The Witness has been halted and Salvation&#x27;s Edge conquered.


The race for world first in Destiny 2&#x27;s Salvation&#x27;s Edge raid has been going on since 1 PM ET on June 7, 2024. After just over 20 grueling hours, one fireteam has emerged victorious, with Bungie announcing them as the first team in the world to complete what will undoubtedly go down as Destiny 2&#x27;s most complicated raid. The winners will each receive raid jackets and exclusive prizes for their efforts, but I imagine all they want is a nice long sleep.

                              <span>Of all of the daily quests that players can acquire in Fallout 76, hacking a terminal is the most loathed of them all. The hacking minigame isn’t as exciting as exterminating pests or hunting down creatures for their materials. Plus, perks are required to attempt to hack most of the terminals found in the game. 


But hacking terminals doesn’t have to be so tedious. Unlike slaying creatures, players don’t have to worry about spawns or interference from others. Terminals are found in fixed locations and are always the same level, so besides the minigame itself, they can be the most straightforward daily quest to complete.

Every team in the race has been working through Salvation&#x27;s Edge at roughly the same pace. They&#x27;re the first people to complete some encounters, and it&#x27;s been such a fun experience to watch as a fan playing this franchise since the Destiny 1 Alpha. However, as fire teams approach what is believed to be the end of the raid, many have turned off their live gameplay feeds.

                              <span>After months of requests from the community, FC Mobile Training Transfer will finally arrive in Ultimate Team as part of the upcoming update.


The new system could be a complete game changer, as it will help players reduce a lot of grind. Anyone who has played the game will know how important it is to train cards, but the process isn&#x27;t infinite. After a certain point, the resources become scarce, which also hinders squad development. The FC Mobile Training Transfer, as planned by EA Sports, will help to reduce many headaches.


FC Mobile Training Transfer Guide


The FC Mobile Training Transfer process will be pretty straightforward, and a new currency will be introduced for the same purpose. You&#x27;ll be able to earn Training Transfer points, which will be used to shift the XP from one card to another.

Select Training Transfer from the menu.


First, select the card from which the training will be transferred.


Second, select the card which will receive the XP.


Click on the &#x27;Transfer&#x27; button to complete the process.



There are still going to be a lot of strategies involved with the transfer process. First, the training transfer will be limited if the target player has a lower rank. In such cases, the extra XP will remain with the original card, and you can transfer it once the rank of the target card is high enough. Additionally, ranks of the cards won&#x27;t be affected by any transfer of training. 


You should also remember that 10% XP will be lost in each transfer. Training Transfer points, required in every exchange, won&#x27;t be infinite either. However, there will be plenty of in-game activities from which players can earn these points.


FC Mobile Training Transfer will be available after the update on June 11. This update will also introduce a new Euro 2024 tournament mode in Ultimate Team. You can select any of the qualified nations and write your own history.

According to the Automaton report and translation, Gainax acknowledged a May 29 Tokyo District Court filing had been accepted. The company stated its cause for bankruptcy was due to mismanagement that began around 2012. Those troubles reportedly surfaced when management and executives began operating the company to suit their private goals, which involved various unprofitable ventures and taking out risky loans.

                              <span>The Finals is a multiplayer first-person shooter about stealing cash and demolishing buildings in a virtual reality game show. Why does it need to be set in a virtual reality game show? So it can do things like transport players to Kyoto in the year 1568, which is what will happen when season three arrives on June 13th.

The Wholesome Direct was today&#x27;s highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you&#x27;ll find the archived stream below.

                              <span>Busy week, this one. We&#x27;ve had a whole load of games announced over the past few days, and there&#x27;ll doubtless be a whole lot more this weekend. Most of them we can&#x27;t play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they&#x27;re completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, &quot;yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run.&quot; So: here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Computer Artworks&#x27; 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren&#x27;t quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you&#x27;re worrying about them, they&#x27;re casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;fear&quot; systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who&#x27;d been in my squad for too long. But it&#x27;s the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They&#x27;ve just announced that they&#x27;re making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

                              <span>A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it&#x27;s neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. &quot;Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op,&quot; say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I&#x27;m happy for them. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Happy happy happy.

No? You don&#x27;t remember? Well, it has been a long year. Never mind, The Crush House now has a release date. But I&#x27;m not telling you what it is until you come watch the new trailer.

Philosophy-obsessed puzzler The Talos Principle 2 is getting a big three-part DLC expansion, and some of the environments look lush. Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

                              <span>Door-and-peace-minus-the-peace FPS Anger Foot, the best game ever made, has finally got a release date: July 11th 2024. This is spectacular news, mainly because I’d already printed off a load of shirts that said ‘Anger Foot GOTY 2024.’ I was going to do some socks, too, but I do not trust this game anywhere near footwear.

                              <span>The creators of Hyper Light Drifter are not ones to rest. In the terrifying tidal wave of trailers that continually washes over us this weekend, they send word of a new game via the Devolver Direct. Possessor(s) is a side-scrolling character action game of mysterious sci-fi horror set in a &quot;quarantined city ripped apart and flooded by an interdimensional catastrophe&quot;. This is coming on top of the already-announced Hyper Light Breaker. Please, Heart Machine, pace yourselves. I barely have time to play the daily crossword.

And look, you don’t have any free hands left to catch this one! Eat plate! You have been well and truly beaten up, but that’s fine. Here’s something nice to take your mind off the pain. Tenjutsu is a new fluid and frenetic punchy-dudey action game from Dead Cells designer Sébastien Benard.

                              <span>Enough moons ago to qualify as quite a lot of moons but not so much for me to categorise them as ‘many’, Alice Bee wrote about an Itch game called Kevin Costner’s Waterworld - a fully playable extrapolation of a Simpsons’ joke from three decades ago. Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don&#x27;t know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I&#x27;ll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.

With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one. Those histories will meet this September, when UFO 50 finally sees the light of day.

                              <span>Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game&#x27;s soulslike Phantom Blade Zero I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it&#x27;s out to eat Sekiro&#x27;s lunch.

                              <span>Are Tamagotchis a thing now again? I’m getting a sense they might be, but I’ll always associate them with the nineties. Ah, to return to a simpler time, where kids tripped each other up in the school hallways to steal toys , before Pokémon cards came along and everyone leveled up to stabbings. Sorry, Petal Runner devs, for opening a news article about your lovely wholesome game talking about stabbings. This gorgeous, fuschia-splashed, slice-of-life RPG is, if anything, the antidote to stabbings. In terms of game fatigue, anyway. It won’t cure tetanus, at least I don’t think so.

                              <span>When the Summer Game Fest trailer for &quot;narrative-centric cosy game&quot; Wanderstop said it was from the creator behind The Stanley Parable, I thought I had surely entered a different dimension where The Stanley Parable was actually a wholesome shop-keeping sim rather than a zig-zagging office-based nightmare. Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

                              <span>Grid-based puzzler Grindstone was a favourite of Katharine’s, who found it to be her go-to during regularly scheduled moments of “cat-based paralysis”. I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. Battle Vision Network is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised space sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.

A new faction and boss. Maybe some other, secret things? All this newness comes as part of the ‘Sakurajima’ update, which releases on June 27th, 2024.

The ‘next-gen’ part probably refers to Unreal Engine 5, and fair’s fair, it’s a real looker this one. The below trailer is mainly scripted or edited bits, but having played a chunk of the last technical test, there’s some genuinely impressive sci-fi vistas to behold, as well as some absolutely massive bosses. Click on the trailer below, until the purple hat or whatever it is you kids grind for these days, pops out with a synapse-tickling noise workshopped by psychologists for eighteen months.

                              <span>I’m not familiar with the proto-internet cartoon Killer Bean, but Graham assures me it’s fairly important in the history of online animation. Regardless, I’ve been won over by the upcoming video game of the same name from original creator Jeff Lew, which looks to blend together Just Cause stunt shenanigans, John Woo slo-mo gunfights and the energy of a third-person action game you would’ve found in a bargain bin for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. It’ll hit early access this summer, courtesy of a fresh look from tonight’s Summer Game Fest showcase.

It&#x27;s a 90s-style 2D brawler for up to five players, involves &quot;time twisting&quot;, and has mode-7-esque arcade shooter bits together with its own spin on the TV show&#x27;s climactic mecha transformation sequences.

Jusant could be tricky, but climbing was more the way you experienced its story. In survival climber Cairn, the ascent is the story. It seem to mainly be a story about how bad you are at climbing.

                              <span>Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today&#x27;s Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror&#x27;s Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. 
Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. 
Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: 


From Eriksholm&#x27;s top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game&#x27;s three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. 
&quot;All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,&quot; studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. &quot;This is just the first glimpse of what we&#x27;ve done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can&#x27;t wait to show you even more in the future.&quot; 
Here are some screenshots from the game: 

Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).

                              <span>Dustborn, the narrative action road trip game developed by Red Thread Games and published by Quantic Dream, received a new trailer during today’s Future Games Show. We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.
Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. 


If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Silver Lining Studio, the developer of Behind The Frame, has revealed its next game, The Star Named EOS, will launch next month. More specifically, the narrative-driven photography-based puzzle game will launch on July 23 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. 
Silver Lining revealed this during today&#x27;s Wholesome Direct, during which it also showcased some new gameplay from The Star Named EOS. In the gameplay trailer, we see more of this game&#x27;s beautiful hand-drawn world, unique puzzles solved through photography, and more. 
Check it out for yourself in The Star Named EOS release date trailer below: 


You might recognize someone in the trailer, too, as the main character&#x27;s mother is voiced by Suzie Yeung, who voices Yuffie in Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The Japanese dub features the voice of Aoi Yūki, who has voiced characters in Persona 5, Genshin Impact, and more, and the Chinese voice-over is performed by Shandy Ma, who has appeared in more than 20,000 commercials and TV shows. 
&quot;The Star Named EOS is a story-driven puzzle game centered on a love for photography and the pursuit of memory,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;As a child, Dei regularly received letters from his mother when she was traveling, each of which came enclosed with a memorable snapshot of the location she was visiting. But one day, Dei notices something peculiar about one of the photographs she left behind, putting everything he believes to the test. Now, guided by his mother&#x27;s voice deep within himself, it&#x27;s time for Dei to set out on his own to learn the truth about his family and confront the echoes of the past.&quot; 
Here are some additional screenshots from The Star Named EOS: 

The Star Named EOS hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on July 23. If you&#x27;re curious about the game, you can download its Steam demo right now.

                              <span>Wanderstop is the next game from the creators of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&#x27;s Guide, and in it, you are a character named Alta who is running a tea shop, though it seems in the past she was a soldier. The trailer starts with charming, cozy tea shop tasks like serving customers and collecting tea ingredients but ends with Alta on a bench working through a panic attack while convincing herself she is living her best life. Both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner&#x27;s Guide are games that play with player perceptions and are some of the best uses of taking the interactive medium to tell stories that only video games can tell. Wanderstop looks like a cozy game, but it&#x27;s safe to assume there is more to it than that.


The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive and is planned for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam.</span>

Shortly after that, though, perhaps the zaniest publisher, Devolver Digital, took to the digital airwaves to showcase six of its games in the 2024 Summer Devolver Direct presentation.

                              <span>Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. 
In Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an &quot;open-ended world structure&quot; as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). 


&quot;Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat,&quot; a press release for Possessor(s) reads. &quot;Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses.&quot;
Throughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. 
Here are some Possessor(s) screenshots: 

Possessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine&#x27;s other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year.

                              <span>Tenjutsu is a jujutsu-inspired action roguelite from Sébastien Benard, lead designer of Dead Cells and solo developer at Deepnight Games, and it&#x27;s coming to consoles and PC sometime in the future. Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.
Devolver describes the game as a &quot;fast and fluid rogue-jutsu,&quot; leaning into the game&#x27;s jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza &quot;hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City.&quot; To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them &quot;you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence.&quot; 
Check out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: 


While you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. 
Here are some Tenjutsu screenshots: 
There is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it&#x27;s coming to undisclosed consoles and PC.

Revealed during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital presentation, the Unholy Alliance update hits Cult of the Lamb on August 12 and adds a new playable character: the Goat. 
With the Goat joining the titular Lamb, players can now experience the entire campaign in local co-op. Devolver says this update includes two-player twists on existing minigames in Cult of the Lamb, like fishing and kuncklebones, as well as additional corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics. 
Check out the two-player action in the Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance trailer below: 


While playing in co-op, players can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, and deal critical hits if their attacks are in sync. Plus, solo players get some new powers and abilities to play with, too. 
Elsewhere in the update, Unholy Alliance adds new buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and more secrets to discover. 
Here are some Cult of the Lamb: Unholy Alliance screenshots: 

Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Unholy Alliance update hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC for free on August 12.

                              <span>The latest Monster Hunter Wilds trailer shows off a chase across desert dunes as burrowing, armored reptiles pursue a squad of hunters. It&#x27;s the latest look at the game following its first gameplay appearance during last week&#x27;s State of Play. 
Though this squad of hunters tries to fight back with gunfire, the ground gives way beneath them, trapping them inside a cave. We then see clips of a proper battle against these beasts, with one character using a very large gun and unleashing hell while atop a mount. The trailer also gives a few glimpses of story moments, but it&#x27;s still hard to parse what the plot of Wilds entails. 


Capcom promised to share more detail about the game during Gamescom. Monster Hunter Wilds arrives in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, which features plenty of gorgeous (and gory) fast-paced action. Though we still haven&#x27;t received a release date, the game is looking great, and it will be playable at Summer Game Fest&#x27;s Play Days this weekend, so we could soon hear how it feels to actually play. 
It will also be playable at a few other locations this year, including Gamescom in August and Tokyo Game Show this September. 
Check out the latest look at Phantom Blade Zero gameplay in the trailer below: 


Revealed as a new entry in the Phantom Blade series during a PlayStation Showcase last year, Phantom Blade Zero is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you control the Dark Raider, who is out for revenge against a group called &quot;The Order.&quot;

                              <span>One of Summer Game Fest’s most intriguing reveals is Killer Bean. This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you&#x27;ve ever seen.


The game&#x27;s Steam page provides the following synopsis: &quot;After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him.&quot;
The humourous gameplay trailer shows the game&#x27;s ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. 
Killer Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.</span>

                              <span>Publisher EA and developer Full Circle have released a new trailer for their long-in-development Skate, the fourth mainline entry in the Skate series and the first in more than a decade. Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, EA announced with the trailer that &quot;console playtesting&quot; for the game will begin this fall; there&#x27;s still no release date for the game, though. 
In the trailer, which begins with a live-action segment starring comedian Tim Robinson (who actually shreds in real life, by the way), we see him as an employee of the fictional M-Corp before transitioning to a look at pre-pre-alpha gameplay of Skate. The gameplay admittedly looks early, but players can check it out on console this fall when &quot;console playtesting&quot; begins. 
Check it out in the Skate. trailer for yourself below: 


EA announced in 2020 that it was working on a new Skate game, and we later learned it will be called &quot;Skate.&quot; instead of Skate 4 like many presumed. We also learned in 2022 that it will be a free-to-play title as well.

                              <span>During the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Riot Games announced that its popular free-to-play hero shooter, Valorant, will be coming to consoles sometime this year. Earlier this week, I had a chance to visit Riot Games, where I not only played its upcoming 2D fighting game set in the League of Legends universe, 2XKO, but also learned all about Valorant for consoles and even got my hands on the upcoming Xbox Series X version.
When creating the console version of Valorant, Riot Games relied on one of the mantras that fueled its PC version: &quot;Creativity Meets Clutch.&quot; This means the studio wants to retain the kind of experience where the game has a strong tactical foundation that caters to the competitive crowd. In speaking with production director Arnar Gylfason, he tells me that even as the …</span>

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is getting DLC tomorrow, June 8, called Night Springs that follows familiar characters from the Alan Wake universe in three &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.


One &quot;episode&quot; follows Rose Marigold from the diner, Alan Wake&#x27;s biggest fan, who feels she is the only one capable of saving him. Another episode follows Shawn Ashmore where he appears to be playing himself as opposed to his character, Sheriff Tim Breaker. Of course, this is Alan Wake, so who knows where the fourth wall line exists. Finally, a third episode follows Jesse Faden from Remedy&#x27;s previous game, Control.
Alongside the DLC, game director Sam Lake took the Summer Game Fest stage to announce that a phsyical verison of the game is finally on the way, as well, and pre-orders open tomorrow. You can read our Alan Wake 2 review here.</span>

                              <span>Uncapped Games, founded in 2021, has debuted its first title: Battle Aces, an action real-time strategy game for PC. Revealed during today&#x27;s 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Uncapped says it designed Battle Aces with RTS newcomers in mind in an attempt to make the somewhat difficult genre more approachable for wider audiences. 
Set in the far-flung future – the 26th Century, to be exact – humanity fights amongst planets in a struggle for resources, weaponry, and more. Players will take on the role of Battle Aces, or mercenary commanders, in charge of high-tech drones to fight &quot;explosive, large-scale battles in the front lines of war.&quot;

                              <span>Sonic x Shadow Generations, a remaster of the original 2011 Generations game with improved visuals and an added Shadow campaign, launches this October. More specifically, a new gameplay trailer Sega released during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase confirms it&#x27;s launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 25, for $49.99. 
In the new trailer, we get a look at some of the Generations gameplay as well as some of the new Shadow the Hedgehog gameplay, which is brand new as part of this release. Not only can you play as Shadow, but Sega has created new levels to play through as the hedgehog. 
Check it out for yourself in the Sonic x Shadow Generations release date trailer below: 


Sega revealed Sonic x Shadow Generations during a January PlayStation State of Play earlier this year, revealing it&#x27;s a remaster of Generations with 60 frames-per-second performance, a playable Shadow the Hedgehog (with new levels, too) alongside Sonic, and more. It looks great, and we can&#x27;t wait to replay one of the Blue Blur&#x27;s best games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Sonic x Shadow Generations hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 25.

                              <span>The Game Bakers, the developers behind 2020&#x27;s Haven, have revealed Cairn, a climbing game all about exploring (and surviving on) a mountain. Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Cairn appears to be about a woman attempting to climb a very high (and difficult) mountain, only to die several times in the process. 
However, if the reveal trailer is any indication, dying isn&#x27;t the end of her climb – just a part of the process. Though not confirmed, this premise seems to point toward Cairn being a roguelite, or at least a game where dying is part of the process. Rockclimbing treachery aside, the game looks beautiful. 
Check it out for yourself in the Cairn reveal trailer below: 


&quot;Reach a summit never climbed before in this survival-climber game,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Climb anywhere and plan your route carefully, managing pitons and resources to survive the unforgiving Mount Kami. Discover what Aava is willing to sacrifice to achieve the ascent of a lifetime.&quot;
Cairn is due out on consoles and PC sometime next year.

Hot off Minecraft&#x27;s 15th anniversary celebrations, Mojang has unveiled a collaboration with the famous puzzle game Tetris in the form of a new add-on. The good news is it&#x27;s available now!
Here&#x27;s a bit about this new add-on which is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace (via Minecraft.net):

Chrono Trigger is still missing in action on Nintendo Switch. Suspiciously so, really. But people said the same thing about Super Mario RPG, and then bam: Nintendo dropped a remake on us. Fans have been asking for a Chrono Trigger remake for decades at this point, so now more than ever, with so many other revivals from Square like Dragon Quest, Live A Live, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and more, it just feels like it’s the right moment.
But with multiple ways to remake this game that many herald as one of the greatest of all time, how exactly should Square remake Chrono Trigger?

The weekend is finally upon us and it&#x27;s time to play some games!
There has been plenty to talk about this week in the world of Nintendo. Yet more &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; rumours trickled in with a fresh batch of supposed codenames, Playtonic announced Yooka-Replaylee (maybe our favourite title of the year, so far) and we finally got a release window for Metal Slug Tactics.

Summer Game Fest 2024 is finally up and running following yesterday&#x27;s Opening Showcase. Geoff Keighley&#x27;s two-hour show featured a good variety of games, big and small, starting off with a surprise for Switch owners in the form of a flagship Sony series making its debut on a Nintendo platform. Sure, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a fun, tongue-in-cheek spin-off of Guerrilla&#x27;s series, but we were still a little taken aback to see that Switch logo at the end of the trailer.
Elsewhere, Switch gamers saw announcements and trailers for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Neva, Civilization VII, Battle Crush, Monster Hunter Stories, and Sonic X Shadow Generations, plus the &#x27;Outersloth&#x27; indie dev initiative from Among Us dev Innersloth will surely yield some fruit on Nintendo&#x27;s console, too. Not a huge amount of Switch news, then, but we&#x27;ve come to expect as much.

                              <span>Arranger! Fear the Spotlight! And More!
Day of the Devs is here once again! This bi-annual celebration, from Double Fine Productions and iam8bit, of the weird and wonderful world of indies is always a delight, and at Summer Game Fest 2024, the showcase didn&#x27;t disappoint.
We got a look at 20 games, including seven World Premieres. These range from the sweet to the silly to the spectacular. Some highly-anticipated indies — including Mossmouth and The Game Bakers&#x27; next games — might have stolen the show, but everything here is worth a look. The big question for us is, &quot;Are these coming to Switch?&quot;. That&#x27;s always difficult for these bigger showcases, but we&#x27;ve got all the answers.

                              <span>Nothing puzzling about that.
Furniture &amp; Mattress&#x27; delightful puzzle game, Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, has a release date. During today&#x27;s Day of the Devs stream, the hand-drawn, story-driven adventure will be coming to Switch (and other platforms) on 25th July 2024.
Originally announced during a Nintendo Direct back in February 2024, Arranger is the debut game from Furniture &amp; Mattress, which combines the indie might of David Hellman (the artist of Braid), Nick Suttner (writer of Carto), and Nicolás Recabarren (designer of Ethereal). With music from Ethereal composer Tomás Batista, it&#x27;s an all-star development team aiming to bring some hand-drawn magic to the world.

If you&#x27;re a toy car fan who didn&#x27;t get your fill from the two (rather good) Hot Wheels games currently on Switch, we&#x27;ve got good news: Matchbox Driving Adventures is pulling up on Switch on 20th September.
However, the premise of this one is a little different, as it&#x27;s not just a straight racer. This spin on Mattel&#x27;s die-cast vehicle line has a Competition Mode, which delivers your standard races (with local split-screen multiplayer for up to four people), but also Adventure Mode, which lets you explore six environments in a more sandbox, playroom-style.

Well, we thought that it might appear in tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest Opening Night Showcase and there it was! SEGA has graced us with a new Sonic X Shadow Generations trailer and it came with a 25th October release date.
While we were very excited to see when this one will be coming our way, the real star of this new trailer is a better look at the all-new Shadow campaign. This fresh story will see you speeding through iconic locations from the Hedgehog&#x27;s history to take on the Black Doom. Ooooo.

                              <span>As part of a copyright infringement lawsuit against DoodStream, the cyberlocker platform was handed orders by a court in India to remove links to all content owned by the major Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, within 24 hours. When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn&#x27;t continue, DoodStream&#x27;s operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest 2024 gave us the first look at the new Power Rangers game, and it’s looking like a blast from the past.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind comes to us via studio Digital Eclipse, and the project appears to be a sidescrolling brawler beat-‘em-up at its heart, with multiple players working together to beat up baddies as they move right across the screen, echoing other favorites of the genre like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or X-Men. But the game also appears to feature other vehicle sequences, including what looks like first-person Zord punching sequences.
The game features online and offline co-op for up to five players.
If you’re looking to pull on your preferred colored ranger suit, you can watch for release on PC and consoles later in 2024.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama founded Bokeh Game Studio back in 2020 to work on a new horror game that we later learned is called Slitterhead. After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game&#x27;s development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.
Revealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead&#x27;s debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead&#x27;s monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. 
Check it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama&#x27;s Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. 
Slitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that&#x27;s Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn&#x27;t happen, but now we know it&#x27;s releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. 
Slitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.

An animated trailer shows off the Fatal Fury guest characters – a first for Street Fighter – while in-game cinematic reveals a rather disheveled M.Bison who looks as maniacal as ever. These four will kick off a new Year of add-on fighters now that Akuma has wrapped up the Year 1 offerings. They&#x27;ll arrive in the following order:

                              <span>Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation saw the stage appearance of Atlus art director Katsura Hashino and artistic designer Shigenori Soejima, who came to offer some early gameplay glimpses of Metaphor: ReFantazio. The role-playing game is the new franchise and story from the same creative team responsible for the recent Persona games, including Persona 5.
The main focus of their presentation was on Archetypes, the game’s approach to classes. The characters of the game transform into various Archetypes, and within the storyline, these Archetypes represent the  manifestion of will to face one’s fears.
Archetypes include the likes of Ninja, Merchant, Warrior, Destroyer, Gunner, Assassin, or Knight. In total, there are more than 40 distinct Archetypes.
The subsequent trailer showed off how some of these Archetypes function in gameplay.
If you’re excited to see the Persona team’s talents translate over into a true fantasy backdrop, Metaphor: ReFantazio is on the way to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and PC, on October 11.</span>

                              <span>Last month Oculus Studios and developer Camoflaj announced a new entry in the Arkham series, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The teaser implied Batman would be tussling with the Rat King (not to be confused with Ratcatcher, we think) in VR, and it would be canon to the Arkham universe that Rocksteady created, but little else was revealed beyond that. Today, we received another pre-rendered trailer, so while we&#x27;re still not sure how the game will look and play, we at least have a better idea of the game&#x27;s tone and characters. The dramatic cover of a popular song chosen for this cinematic trailer? &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins A.K.A. the rat in a cage song.


The trailer shows Gordon, The Rat King, seemingly in a prison cell, and what appears to be a still-sane version of Harley Quinn. Here is the story outline from the trailer&#x27;s press release.
It’s the Fourth of July, and Gotham City is besieged by a new threat: the mysterious Rat King and his cultish devotees. Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The Rats have pledged to execute them in one week’s time for “crimes committed against the people of Gotham City.”
As widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called “Day of Wrath,” but it all goes wrong.
Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll experience the origins of such iconic characters as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, and more, as Batman grapples with the contradiction at the core of his identity—the use of force in pursuit of

The press release for the new trailer promises the game will have a &quot;blend of exploration, stealth, and free-flowing combat the series is known for.&quot; The game is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 this year.</span>

Gris was notable for its beautiful art direction, and Neva is no slouch in that department. It looks beautiful, as do the animations of the woman, Alba, and Neva, her canine companion. In addition to platforming, Alba can gracefully cut down foes with her sword as Neva backs her in combat. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Neva appears to age over time, growing much larger than Alba indicating the game unfolds over a substantial passage of time.


Neva is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

This reveal follows Geoff Keighley&#x27;s teasing back in May that 2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its &quot;biggest and most beloved franchises&quot; at SGF. Many assumed it might be the next BioShock or Mafia game, but it turns out it was Civilization 7, the first entry in the series since 2016&#x27;s Civilization 6 by Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns developer Firaxis Games. In the reveal trailer, we get a look at various eras of history in a stylized cinematic trailer, but there&#x27;s no gameplay to be seen. 
Check it out for yourself in the Civilization 7 reveal trailer below: 


Civilization 7 will launch simultaneously on consoles and PC in 2025.

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed Lego Horizon Adventures, a Lego brick version of Guerrilla Games&#x27; hit Horizon series. Like Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy returns in Lego Horizon Adventures as the protagonist of the exploration-based adventure game. It&#x27;s releasing simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this holiday. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures seems to take the fun, action, and robot dinosaurs of the Horizon series and turn it all into bricks (literally). However, instead of world-ending threats, Lego Horizon Adventures has a much more comedic and tongue-in-cheek vibe to Aloy&#x27;s journey, with an emphasis on two-player co-op action. It&#x27;s being developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.

                              <span>Durring Summer Game Fest, a new Harry Potter game was revealed, but it&#x27;s not related to Hogwarts Legacy. The game focuses on the in-universe sport Quidditch and is called Harry Potter Quidditch Champions. The game has a light, cartoony style (especially compared to Hogwarts Legacy). This isn&#x27;t the first Quidditch-focused game. Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup released in 2003.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Kill Knight has a simple, bloody premise. As an undead knight, you must slaughter waves of monsters using guns and a sword in pursuit of the last angel. This wave-based arcade-style shooter has a potent &quot;one more run&quot; hook as you try to ascend five levels while climbing the leaderboards, and we&#x27;re intrigued to see more of it. Watch Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hillard battle hordes of beasts in this upcoming shooter.

                              <span>Given Mega Man’s enormous presence on classic Nintendo consoles, it’s surprising that the only game available on the Nintendo Switch Online libraries has been Mega Man: The Wily Wars…for Sega Genesis. That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.
Right now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:
Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge
Mega Man II
Mega Man III
Mega Man IV
Mega Man V


For those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware.

                              <span>Neva is immediately recognisable as the next puzzle platformer from the developers behind Gris thanks to its sweeping, overlapping planes and effortlessly natural watercolour art, which were both on show again in tonight’s Geoffest Summer Game Fest show. I was expecting more eye candy from Neva after its announcement last summer, but what caught me by surprise was all the hacking and slashing that ensues in its second trailer.

                              <span>Oh, this one looks nice, doesn’t it? Tears Of Metal is a rousing medieval stabathon that sees you retaking your Scottish island from a bunch of bad lads who’ve decided to come have a go, which was a bit silly of them, honestly. It’s a hack n’ slash co-op roguelike with some nifty looking strategy elements and a striking art style, but you can tell most of that from the trailer below:

Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII is surely one of the biggest announcements of this year&#x27;s (in-progress, as I type this) Summer Game Fest 2024, and yet it was buried in that middle section, as unassuming as Sid himself.

                              <span>Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It&#x27;s the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman&#x27;s too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you&#x27;re trying to fend him off with.


There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

There’s at least one level in it that feels like essay-bait, so I’m obliging. The centerpiece of Mars Core - the FPS’  best level - is a comically massive superweapon called the BFG-10000. Oh, Chekov. If only you could see what we’ve done with your wisdom. The literary subtlety to gun-big-enough-to-scar-planets pipeline will eventually subsume all of pop culture, and those of us who chose to specialise writing about headshots will alternate between grins and tears from the wreckage.

                              <span>In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like horror tower defence Bella Wants Blood comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’.

                              <span>Back in 2020, fresh out of high school and feeling unstoppable, Charles Maddock and a few friends “decided to code a game about Fish Wizards.” The result was Fishards,  Magicka-inspired PVP arena action that has you out-squirt, out-splash, and out-spellcast your mates. It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.

                              <span>With its no-holds-barred &#x27;dynamic+&#x27; injunctions, capable of blocking sites perpetually and forcing domain seizures in the U.S., India&#x27;s emergence as a global copyright enforcer is remarkable. Yet, when the major Hollywood studios teamed up with Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, to obtain a strict, immediate injunction against a site considered a global piracy threat, early non-compliance wasn&#x27;t harshly punished. Indeed, documents suggest that injunctions are up for negotiation.

                              <span>A new report in Bloomberg describes the development of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League and the issues which may have led to Rocksteady&#x27;s expensive live service game flopping at launch. Staff, talking under condition of anonymity, described corporate owners who pushed for a multiplayer game from the studio known for singleplayer experiences, as well as indecisive leadership and a culture of &quot;toxic positivity&quot;.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is no more. No, EA haven&#x27;t once again taken Dragon Age 4 back to the drawing board; instead, they&#x27;ve just changed its name. The next entry in their trad-fantasy RPG series is now called Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and we&#x27;ll get a &quot;first look at gameplay&quot; next week.

                              <span>I’ve been scouring Steam Next Fest demos specifically for something laid back, and Spilled! – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of PowerWash Simulator or Viscera Cleanup Detail, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.

I&#x27;d spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.
Glyphica reminds me of those heady days. It&#x27;s a roguelite horde survival game where you&#x27;ve got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it&#x27;s the perfect warm up for someone who&#x27;s about to do a big essay or maybe defend Dark Souls 2 in an errant comments section. It&#x27;s fun!

                              <span>Maybe you can relate, but I tend to find I crave twee and colorful things proportionally inverse to my melancholy. If I’m having a good week, give me Fear and Hunger and horrible films like Speak No Evil. If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It&#x27;s got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.

No, it doesn&#x27;t boast a title in all-caps, but Selaco&#x27;s early access release more than deserves it&#x27;s spot as a must-play for those who desire some sophistication with their ultra-violence.

                              <span>Taipei’s annual Computex event is always a big, circled, triple-underlined mark in the PC gaming hardware calendar. Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.
Sadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?
Granted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...

                              <span>Fucksweeper is a difficult game to play in shared accommodation, a very difficult game to play in the crowded airport lounge I&#x27;m currently sitting in, and an incredibly difficult game to play on the airplane I will shortly be boarding. What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.

                              <span>After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you&#x27;ll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course.

                              <span>Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!
First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace&#x27;s Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!

                              <span>With the AMD EPYC 4004 series that was announced in May and we have delivered benchmarks of the entire EPYC 4004 stack from the 4-core SKU up through the 16-core model with 3D V-Cache, there are many advantages over Intel&#x27;s Xeon E-2400 series competition. In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.</span>

Some models are also already available for pre-order ahead of launch day. This is quite nice compared to in the past there was often at times quite a delay between the initial AMD Ryzen mobile announcements and being able to (pre)order any hardware. And thus I&#x27;ve already been looking around to coordinate near launch day Linux testing of the new AMD Zen 5 powered Ryzen AI 300 series hardware...</span>

                              <span>Developer Sobaka Studio has revealed Kiborg: Arena, a roguelike that looks like a cyberpunk Sifu. Revealed during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. 
In the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. &quot;Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.&quot; It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. 
Check out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:


In Arena, players find &quot;Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma&#x27;s Colisseum. Here, Morgan&#x27;s clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.&quot; Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.
In the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. 
Here are some Kiborg screenshots: 

Arena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The full Kiborg game does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Developer Playtonic has revealed Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of its 2017 platformer Yooka-Laylee. It revealed this during today&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective 2024 Showcase with a new trailer that highlighted the game&#x27;s new visuals, improved camera and gameplay controls, remixed challenges, and more. 
&quot;Embark on an epic open-world 3D platforming collectathon adventure with Yooka and Laylee,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;The search for Pagies starts anew in Yooka-Replaylee, the enhanced definitive version of the beloved indie darling with all new challenges, secrets, mechanics, and accessibility options.&quot; 
Check it out for yourself in the Yooka-Replaylee reveal trailer below: 


Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Wii U, and PC, and we had a great time with it – you can read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee review. Though the game is a 3D collect-a-thon, it got a sequel in 2019 called Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair that played more like Donkey Kong Country. 
Yooka-Replaylee is coming to PC and unspecified consoles. It has no release window.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the next game in the series, has a new name – Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare first teased the game back in 2018, and we later learned it was called Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022. Now, BioWare has changed the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with a promise of a first look at its gameplay next week on Tuesday, June 11. 
As for why, the team explains it&#x27;s about the characters that will make up the companions you meet in the game in a new blog post. 


&quot;At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you&#x27;re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story.

                              <span>We got our first look at Firewalk Studios&#x27; upcoming 5v5 first-person shooter Concord last week during a PlayStation State of Play, which is where we also learned it will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23 after a beta this July. Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game&#x27;s preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. 
That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will &quot;expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates&quot; for all players at no additional cost. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord box art: 
Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game&#x27;s August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: 
&quot;Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there&#x27;s no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.&quot; 
That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.

                              <span>The Angry Birds Movie 3 is officially in production. The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.
Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. 
A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. 
While we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here. You can also read the latest news on other upcoming video game films, such as Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Nintendo&#x27;s live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, Mortal Kombat 2, Minecraft, and Borderlands.</span>

Bloomberg reports that following the release of DC&#x27;s Suicide Squad in 2016, which made $750 million at the box office on a budget of $175 million, Warner Bros. wanted to build on that IP&#x27;s success.

                              <span>Last year&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II is now available on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Square Enix has announced. Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. 
If you&#x27;re on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you&#x27;ve been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II review. 


To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an &quot;Extra Battle&quot; mode that becomes available after defeating the game&#x27;s final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
&quot;Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as.&quot;

                              <span>Are you familiar with terms like 2-minute meta, homogenization, or even transpose lines? If you are, then this article might be up your alley. New expansions are always a fun time, especially for high-end raiders who will be getting shiny new buttons to press, and with that comes new rotations. After approximately 8,000 hours of playing Final Fantasy XIV and clearing The Omega Protocol on release, I think I&#x27;m able to provide some insight about the new weaponskills, spells, and abilities (and their implications for rotations, openers, and general play) I saw at a recent preview event for its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. I am not an expert at every job, and I could not test each job to its limit, so feel free to point out mistakes on my part.

Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.</span>

                              <span>A new viral video shows that many of Fortnite’s premium cars—which can only be unlocked by purchasing them with V-Bucks—are safer to drive around in compared to the free models in the game. This is proving to be a problem in Fortnite’s newest car-focused season, and it seemingly goes against Epic’s policy of cosmetics…

                              <span>The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it&#x27;s adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.
The Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. 
“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”
Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be &quot;quite big&quot; in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.
HBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” 
For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II&#x27;s events, it seems you can relax. We&#x27;ll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.

Hauntii drew me in immediately thanks to its striking illustrated art direction and enchanting jazz noir soundtrack. A powerful opening sees the protagonist, an adorable ghost who recently died, attempting to ascend to a heavenly plane hand in hand with an angel-like guardian, only to be shackled and pulled back to the depths of Eternity. It’s an emotionally effective moment, and while the gameplay doesn’t always prove as captivating, it provides enough thrills to propel through an eye-popping…</span>

This week, &#x27;Adam Ruins Everything&#x27; star Adam Conover mentioned BitTorrent as a viewing option for fans who no longer have access to the series after HBO removed it a few months ago.

                              <span>In August 2023, video game giant Bungie filed yet another copyright infringement-based lawsuit targeting up to 50 individuals involved in developing and selling cheat tools for Destiny 2. What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint&#x27;s introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could&#x27;ve been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie&#x27;s relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.

                              <span>Mods are to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 what butter is to bread, that unreadable squiggle-font is to death metal bands or wheels are to the bottom of trainers when you’re a kid: not necessarily essential, per se, but so harmonious and well-suited that they feel essential. In the case of the D&amp;D CRPG, it’s a natural extension of playing dungeon master around the table, crafting the world and its characters as you see fit - typically by making everyone in Faerûn even hornier somehow.

                              <span>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset was on the way, and it looked to be fairly soon - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...

That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.

A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year&#x27;s Lies Of P. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into Enotria: The Last Song, which has a demo on Steam.

Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like Silent Hill charged with the hot pink body horror of Porpentine interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game&#x27;s demo, it&#x27;s a powerful combo.

You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as &quot;is this a door?&quot; accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Are you alone?&quot; and &quot;Is it safe to be alone?&quot; and &quot;You are alone&quot; and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.

                              <span>Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision&#x27;d your way through. I like what I&#x27;ve played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and &#x27;form your own opinions&#x27;. Pah.

                              <span>Witchy roguelike Hades 2 got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It&#x27;s like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe&#x27;s heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven&#x27;t had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set aside some time this evening for Destiny 2&#x27;s latest expansion The Final Shape, which launched last night. My pal Liam suggested we play this evening because Bungie&#x27;s servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.

                              <span>Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. The Alters is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a &quot;quantum computer&quot;, splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home.

                              <span>A popular GitHub repo and over 120 forks containing Switch emulation tutorials have been targeted by Nintendo. While most forks are now disabled, the main repository has managed to survive after being given the opportunity to put things right. Whether Nintendo appreciated the irony is unclear, but it appears that use of encoding as a protection measure to obfuscate links, was no match for the video game company&#x27;s circumvention skills.

The announcement post doesn&#x27;t go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that &quot;our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time&quot; and that &quot;we&#x27;re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players.&quot;

                              <span>I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt&#x27;s racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 


I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf&#x27;s Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game&#x27;s art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and &quot;small interactive moments&quot; I&#x27;ve long admired, but never managed to write about until now.

                              <span>From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, I thought: no bother, like. Everyone has different skills. Then, I realised that some other people might be less enlightened than me about the whole ‘having limits’ things, and that there was a lot of money to be made hawking implants. Enter space strategy story-spewer Stellaris, specifically, it’s spost specent spee-LC The Machine Age. It adds many options for your space civs, most of which I’m too rusty with the ever-yawpening sandbox’s myriad nuances to appreciate. But what&#x27;s this? A new origin that lets you play as techno-religious corpo-cult obsessed with transcending the limits of their meat prisons through cybernetic augmentations? I recognise that from toys! Let’s do some clicking.

                              <span>Yes, I&#x27;ve played a portion of Elden Ring&#x27;s expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and I think it&#x27;s brilliant. But there&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t flesh out in the preview and that&#x27;s the DLC&#x27;s standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.

Life In Jars is this YouTuber I&#x27;ve followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He&#x27;ll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It&#x27;s a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.
Having spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s opening area, I can&#x27;t help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.

                              <span>I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception. Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since the sound of engines began. The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

                              <span>If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don&#x27;t currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of Mech Engineer, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 


Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today&#x27;s puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn&#x27;t aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a &quot;means of fun&quot;. Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.

Where its offworld mining concern once dealt merely with steep drops and irate bugs, it’s since had to face down the robotic army of a rival mineral corp and an omnicidal alien plague. If the subsequent question is &quot;It used to be about the rocks, y&#x27;know?&quot; then DRG’s imminent Season 5 update, Drilling Deeper, is the answer.

Like A Dragon: Yakuza will be a six-part series following characters in the criminal underbelly of Kamurocho, set to straddle between two time periods: 1995 and 2005. The series &quot;showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore,” said Amazon, who are releasing it through Prime Video, just like their Fallout series.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

Jumping G.K&#x27;s Game-a-Palooza. The AAAArghs. The Second Fall Of Babel. Trailarmageddon. The Sparkling Stink. SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I&#x27;ll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

Did you know that the word &#x27;book&#x27; was originally spelled with several extra &#x27;o&#x27;s in it? This was changed when it was collectively decided that telling someone to &quot;please, just read a book&quot; was resulting in several more murders a year than anyone could be bothered to keep track of. This week, it’s Obsidian vet and Pentiment creator Josh Sawyer! Cheers Josh! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t played Bloodborne and so references to its world or characters mean little to me. Kart racers, meanwhile? There I&#x27;m in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It&#x27;s those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.

                              <span>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

                              <span>Merry weekends, everyone! It&#x27;s time for a chill couple of days, I think. A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>On June 1, 1999, the first public release of Napster launched online, kick-starting a global piracy frenzy that never disappeared. At the same time, it can be argued that the file-sharing software paved the way for legitimate business models that would eventually evolve into subscription-based platforms such as Spotify and Netflix.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that online piracy presents a major challenge to copyright holders. With owners of pirate sites largely unresponsive, search engines and other online intermediaries are often asked to intervene. With a starring role for anti-piracy company Link-Busters, Google has seen a significant surge in takedown requests, one that has set new records on the way.

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>Arkane Austin&#x27;s ailing vampire shooter Redfall has received its final update, as the developers themselves are purged by parent company Microsoft. Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

                              <span>I regret not covering Skald Colon Against The Black Priory when its developer told us about it 2019. I&#x27;d get to be so smug now.
Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

                              <span>So ends another month of the RPS Game Club, which means another chance to gather together and swap video game opinions like scary stories ‘round the campfire. The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Reddit is not required to hand over to filmmakers the IP-addresses of several Redditors who made piracy-related comments. A California federal court denied the filmmakers&#x27; request for a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review, after turning down their initial request in February. While this is bad news for the movie companies, a viable alternative appeared recently.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.
