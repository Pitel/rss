Thunderful Group&#x27;s latest interim report is out now (which you can read here), and while it reveals the company had a bit of a weak first few months of 2022, things are looking up for it. Most notably, the future of one of its biggest IPs — the SteamWorld series — is looking very bright.
Last year, we found out about a brand new third-person co-op sequel to SteamWorld Dig — SteamWorld Headhunter — at the Thunderful Games showcase. We&#x27;ve got to wait until 2023 to get our hands on that, which is a little bit of a wait, but we&#x27;ll be rewarded for our patience with three other SteamWorld games, all releasing in 2023 or 2024.

When the Nintendo Switch launched in March 2017, I — like many others — devoured The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I was hooked, and it was only when Mario Kart 8 Deluxe launched a month later that I was wrenched away from the land of Hyrule. But while Mario Kart 8 remains as incredible as it was on the Wii U — more so, in fact — I bounced off it pretty quickly; a case of ‘been there, done that’, perhaps. I’d already completed the non-Deluxe version and felt like I was just going through the motions. Nevertheless, I played it more or less to completion; after all, I dropped £50 on the digital version, giving me a certain obligation to at least polish off the single-player component.
So with that done, I found myself in a bit of a rut; I’d rinsed Breath of the Wild and I now faced a daunting two or three months without anything to keep me occupied until the eventual release of Splatoon 2. Then a game popped up on the eShop in May 2017; a smaller, unassuming title that nevertheless gained much-deserved recognition and acclaim in the months leading up to its release. That game was Thumper.

We&#x27;re really feeling the onslaught of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 news at the moment, and today, Nintendo of Europe has thrown us even more nuggets of information about the game. After we got a look at Millick Meadows and Eagus Wilderness in an update last week, we&#x27;ve now got a closer look at two nature-abundant areas that have a lot more relics of the past.
The recent screenshots and character details haven&#x27;t been shy about showing off hints of past locations, or even using the names of them, in Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and today&#x27;s selection is no different. If you&#x27;re a series fan, you&#x27;re bound to get your head in a spin working out just what is in each location, and how everything has ended up there.

We have to say, The Pokémon Company has been absolutely killing it with its short animated series over the past few years. And it now has what looks to be another stunning series, as the first episode in the Pokémon Legends: Arceus anime series, Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, is out now and available online!
Hisuian Snow follows Alec, a young boy who meets a Hisuian Zorua out in the wild. The people of Hisui believe that Pokémon are hostile and that they can&#x27;t live in harmony with humans — just like in the game — but Alec&#x27;s encounter with the cute little fox leads to the boy questioning that belief. Also, a shiny on your first try? That&#x27;s a bit unfair!

Nihon Falcom is one of Japan&#x27;s premier RPG developers, and has been making games since 1982. The company is most famous for the Ys series, debuting in 1987 with Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished, and also later creating The Legend of Heroes series in 1989 with Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes.
And it seems like Nihon Falcom&#x27;s president, Toshihiro Kondo, wants to do something with its large back catalogue. In the latest issue of Famitsu, Kondo has revealed that there are already &quot;plans&quot; to bring more titles to the Nintendo Switch. Perhaps not too surprising, given last year the company created an in-house development team for the Switch, but still exciting!

We already know that an N64 module is in development, but one system that fans have constantly been asking about is the Sega Dreamcast.

Bandai Namco&#x27;s long-awaited remaster package of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#x27;s Veil is right around the corner and in anticipation of the adorable dream traveller&#x27;s return, the company has released the opening cutscenes to both games in the Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series collection.
This is the first time the games have been rereleased together, and the very first time that Lunatea&#x27;s Veil has even seen a rerelease (after the first game got a Wii remake in 2009).

While all the trendy kids talk about Streets of Rage 4 and (accurately) discuss how awesome it is, those of us that prefer the soft glow of nostalgia look back to the original. In truth it doesn&#x27;t hold up as well as its outstanding sequel, but it&#x27;s an iconic game among retro enthusiasts and some of us that had our young minds blown back in the day.
Always open to monetising nostalgia, SEGA has teamed up with Numskull Designs for a few bits of merchandise, available now in Europe from the official online SEGA store. As you can see in the image at the top there&#x27;s a t-shirt, hat and mug - presumably because some consumers that happen to be older gentlemen like this scribe need t-shirts for getting the groceries, a hat to cover the expanding bald spot, and a mug for drinking tea and coffee.

Who would have thought that a chance encounter between leaves and hot water would lead to one of the most popular hot drinks in the world? Tea is a necessity for many of us to survive, mostly because the Nintendo Life team is 90% British, but also because it serves as a soothing, relaxing ritual that starts our day.
This article? Fuelled by tea. Our reviews? Caffeinated by a nice cuppa. And this feature, in which we speak to the developers of upcoming Switch game, Spirittea? Literally would not exist without the existence of Camellia Sinensis, the plant that made all this possible.

Developer Francisco Gonzalez has unveiled Lamplight City, a detective adventure game inspired by the likes of Edgar Allen Poe and Charles Dickens launching on Switch on June 2nd, 2022. It sees you take control of Miles Fordham, a private investigator within the New Bretagne, a thriving port city that falls foul to five grisly crimes.
Your job is to solve each of the five cases, but Lamplight City has been designed to let you fail. Multiple suspects and false leads may throw you off the game, but when a crime becomes unsolvable, the narrative will continue regardless, your failure to solve the case affecting various story aspects.

NISA Europe has released a brand new trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero which introduces us to the Special Support Section — the main cast in the fourth game in the Kiseki/Trails series. Originally released in Japan on the PlayStation Portable in 2010, this upcoming Switch port marks the game&#x27;s first official English release in the West.
These &quot;new protectors of Crossbell&quot; are Lloyd Bannings, a rookie detective who fights with duel tonfas; Elie MacDowell, the pistol-wielding granddaughter of the mayor of Crossbell City; Tio Plato, master of orbal technology (magic) and a child genius; and Randy Orlando, a flirt and battle-hardened halberd fighter.

One of the regular perks of a Nintendo Switch Online membership is access to Game Trials, in which you can download and play full versions of games for a week - with enough hours it&#x27;s certainly possible to reach the credits in some of the titles that have featured.
Nintendo of Europe has announced its next NSO trial, and it&#x27;s a rather good one - Spelunky 2 will be available to play from 25th to 31st May, though subscribers can pre-install now if they want to be ready to go next week.

The official announcement trailer is sadly age-restricted, so we&#x27;ll instead ask that you head on over to YouTube and check out the gameplay for yourself - go on, off you pop. Come back after, though!

Announced in February 2021 and released just five months later, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD was a welcome upgrade for an oft-under loved Zelda title. One of the biggest changes to the HD port was the addition of a second control scheme — the ability to play the game without motion controls, which made the game more accessible to tons of people.
Tom Crago, CEO of Tantalus — the developers who made this port possible — spoke about the difficulties of translating the motion controls of the Wii Remote to the Switch&#x27;s button inputs on a recent episode of the Fragments of Silicon podcast.

                              <span>Finally we see new moves for the best weapon.
Though it&#x27;s still over a month away (arriving on 30th June), Capcom is promoting Sunbreak - the major upcoming expansion for Monster Hunter Rise - a great deal. Recently we&#x27;ve had a look at the single-player Follower Quests, and it&#x27;s also started a run of weapon showcase videos that highlight new moves and the upcoming &#x27;Switch Skill Swap&#x27; ability.
In the first batch we saw Sword &amp; Shield, Switch Axe and Heavy Bowgun, and we have another three videos to enjoy. Pleasingly this includes the Insect Glaive, which in this writer&#x27;s humble opinion is the most awesome of Monster Hunter weapons, though it certainly got debuffed a bit in Rise. Lots of players master multiple weapons, but some have a favourite that they return to every time, which is an equally fun way to play.

The next entry to the &#x27;Arcade Archives&#x27; line-up has been revealed. Arcade Archives Trio the Punch will launch on Switch tomorrow (May 19th) for the standard price of $7.99 / €6.99 / £6.29.
Originally released in 1990 by Data East, the game is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in which you choose one of three playable characters: Tough Guy, Ninja, and Swordsman. You&#x27;ll be navigating a variety of environments, including a rainforest, urban cities, a Middle Eastern desert, medieval Japan, and a futuristic military base.

The next summoning event in Fire Emblem Heroes is coming later this week, and it looks like a rather lovely affair — if a little bit inconvenient for war. Though we suppose wearing a wedding dress into battle is a little bit iconic.
The Bridal Blossoms event kicks off on 20th May from 12am PDT / 5am EDT / 8am BST / 9am CET for a whole month, and will include four wedding-themed units — three brides and one groom (and his father, for some reason). It&#x27;s similar to previous wedding-themed events that have come out over the years, and it will even come with a new paralogue.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t let you do that, Fox.
Star Fox might not be one of Nintendo&#x27;s biggest-selling franchises, but it certainly has a passionate following; the first SNES game was revolutionary in that it harnessed the Super FX chip to create a convincing 3D world, while subsequent titles both refined the format and took it in new directions. However, since 2016&#x27;s Star Fox Zero, the franchise has sadly remained dormant.
Even so, any item related to the genesis of Star Fox is likely to attract attention, and we were recently informed that one of the first-ever pieces of development artwork relating to the game was very nearly thrown away.

                              <span>One of the fund&#x27;s biggest moves to date.
It&#x27;s been a disruptive period in the game industry, with an increasing number of major takeovers and notable investments, ranging from Tencent continuing to expand its reach, Sony in the process of purchasing Bungie and Microsoft in a similar stage of its Activision Blizzard acquisition. In terms of financial manoeuvring we&#x27;ve seen some notable moves from Nintendo, too. It recently ran another major buyback of its own shares, and later this year will implement a 10-for-1 stock split; the latter is a move typically made by companies in strong financial health.
Today the focus shifts to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s &#x27;Public Investment Fund&#x27; (PIF), a government-run sovereign wealth fund. As reported by Bloomberg, PIF has acquired a 5.01% stake in Nintendo, stating that the move is for investment purposes. That stake makes it the fifth biggest shareholder of Nintendo.

                              <span>Arriving 13 years after the original Shatter.
Some re-releases and remasters pop up as a bit of a surprise, and we&#x27;re pretty sure that Shatter Remastered Deluxe falls into that category. Originally released on PlayStation 3, PC and mobile back in 2009, it was a high energy take on the classic &#x27;Breakout&#x27; formula, and well received at the time. Over a decade later it&#x27;s making a return, with Switch among the platforms set to get the game later this year.
It looks pretty darn fun, too, as modern approaches to iconic game styles can certainly serve up compulsive play and plenty of style. This updated version will have updated visuals and improved audio quality, and will be just $9.99USD (with regional equivalents) when it arrives.

Well, after a decade of spin-offs, movies, and countless collaborations, the two titanic IP have joined forces, with an Angry Birds Adventure World now available for download in Minecraft.
Available for 1,340 Minecoins, which is roughly around $9.99, the add-on will let you play as one of six Angry Birds characters, along with an additional ten character skins.

                              <span>It took more than 10 years, but Shinji Mikami says his original vision for Tango Gameworks is finally coming to life.
Mikami established Tango in 2010 after nearly two decades at Capcom, directing games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4, and a few years contracting for Platinum Games, where he directed Vanquish. His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.
“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry. When you’re in your 30s, you have the right balance – you’re energetic and have your ego a…</span>

                              <span>Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: 
New Game Announcement!

May 18, 2022
As you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. 
Elsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. 
In the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think.

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.
Along with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.
If you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures. Overwatch&#x27;s Junkrat and D.Va, Bayonetta, and Hades&#x27; Zagreus are just a few of them that you can grab. You can find more about Aloy at Good Smiles&#x27; official site.

                              <span>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. 
The long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: 
“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” 
To soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. 
Nacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.&quot; You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. 
Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012&#x27;s Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. 
2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.
On May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. 


As players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. 
Roller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. 
Roller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

coverage here.

As the title implies, I am not somebody who has ever really cared all that much about the Warcraft series or its MMO counterpart, World of Warcraft. I have memories of playing one of the Warcraft games back on a PC circa 2003, so it was probably Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, but I never really followed the franchise beyond that. All of this is to set up and say that if you’re looking for what a hardcore Warcraft fan thinks of the series’ first venture into the mobile space in Warcraft Arclight Rumble, I’m not your guy. 
However, as someone who doesn’t care about Warcraft ... I’m really enjoying Warcraft Arclight Rumble. I can only speak on the gameplay to…</span>

Escape Rooms have become all the rage over the last decade, but the pandemic has put a damper on the in-person experience. Escape Academy brings the concept home, expanding the concept into a broader adventure set in an unusual university. 
You control a new student enrolled at a school dedicated to training escape artists. Nearly every room, floor, or corridor of this institution hides a puzzle or three, and very little is what meets the eye. The same extends to the eclectic faculty, including a mysterious headmaster. The first-person game tasks you …</span>

That’s because Deathverse is getting two open betas, and the first one takes place next week. More specifically, it will take place from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. PDT on May 28. The second will be live from 1 p.m. to 6 a.m. PDT on June 5. PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners can pre-download the game starting today from the PlayStation Store.

We had the pleasure of having the upcoming reboot of Saints Row on the cover of Game Informer issue #340 when I went hands-on with an early build of the game and spoke with the fine folks at Volition, the studio behind the series. Last week, the developer held a preview event, showing off where Saints Row is now, just a few months before launch. Much of what was shown was the same content as last year, but there were plenty of changes I noticed that have me feeling good about the direction this new Saints adventure is taking.

                              <span>The first episode of Pokémon: Huisian Snow, a new limited web Pokémon series, is now live on YouTube.
It’s less than seven minutes long so it’s worth a watch for anyone who likes Pokémon, but it’s especially a must-watch for fans of this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus. That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, &quot;Onto the Icy Blue.&quot;
“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” 


We won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. 
After watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game. Check out the three starters for the next generation of Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after that.

Vampires secretly walk among us. They drive fast cars. Lord above us in penthouses. And are so refined in their tastes, they bite our wrists gently when feeding, hopefully keeping us alive for future snacks. Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong explores the nightwalkers&#x27; place in our world through a nicely designed narrative lens that embraces player choice in deep and satisfying ways.
Within the opening seconds of play, we learn that the vampires&#x27; Boston Camarilla is on high alert; trouble arising moments after crownin…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that Square Enix has news to share in regards to the Final Fantasy VII franchise next month. 
Nomura said this in a Japanese live stream about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. 
The last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. 
All of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that.

                              <span>Disney has unveiled the first trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the upcoming Marvel series that premieres on Disney+ this August.
Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer juggling an increasingly chaotic life, including working for a newly launched superhuman law division. Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). 


You can also check out the official poster below:
She-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June.

                              <span>Being a father changes you. After years of resolutely hating on Sonic, my son&#x27;s interest in the characters, games and cartoon has softened me up. I will now begrudgingly admit that Sonic Boom is alright, and the first Sonic live action movie is better than expected. 

So here I am, looking at the new footage of Sonic Origins, which collects and remasters the blue hedgehog&#x27;s original platform games.

                              <span>Game Pass is particularly ideal for two kinds of games: indie games you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like enough to commit to the upfront cost, and decent-not-great blockbusters you know almost certainly aren&#x27;t worth the cost but would quite like to play for at least a bit.

There are plenty of games that fit into both of these categories joining the subscription service before the end of May, including Vampire Survivors, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Sniper Elite 5 and Jurassic World Evolution 2.

                              <span>Three or four times a year, someone at Square Enix says that news is coming about Final Fantasy and we all get our hopes up. This is one of those times. Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy VII Remake director, has said that &quot;various&quot; announcements are coming next month related to Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Will it be news about the second part of the FF7 Remake - or will it be, I dunno, a livestreamed concert and some phone wallpapers?

This should make the newly launched Core i9-12900KS, in a way, the realest deal of all: it’s structurally identical to the Core i9-12900K, originally the top-spec CPU in the series, but made with an even more discerning binning process. A component of the highest quality components, if you will, and as such can brush past the Core i9-12900K’s maximum boost clock speed of 5.2GHz to reach a scorching 5.5GHz.

Maybe you&#x27;re actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship&#x27;s load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

The game&#x27;s first PvP beta drew to a close today, but we should find out what&#x27;s next for the hero shooter at next month&#x27;s event. The blog post doesn&#x27;t give much away, all told, but according to the game&#x27;s official Twitter account the event will include more details about its next PvP beta. Fingers crossed for an invite this time.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that little inconsequential choices are better than controlling a turret. I am pleased that quite a few people did actually pick turrets. But this week, in the name of experimentation, I&#x27;m trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can&#x27;t imagine many will think this good, let&#x27;s give it a go, for science. Tell me, what&#x27;s better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

I just hope the water in the kettle doesn’t come from the bathhouse.

                              <span>Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like &quot;Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,&quot; and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly&#x27;s wing, indeed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we&#x27;ve heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you&#x27;d expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It&#x27;s a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like &quot;cops&quot;, &quot;switch car&quot; and &quot;plan&quot;, leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can&#x27;t think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

                              <span>3D gaming is… well, if not dead, then at best being kept in an iron lung by a teensy niche of enthusiasts. However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

                              <span>From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren&#x27;t exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn&#x27;t an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

There&#x27;s no release date just yet, but have a watch of the teaser trailer below. It looks a real treat.

                              <span>Not content with hosting the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest last weekend, Italy has now received a glam up in Microsoft Flight Simulator’s ninth world update. Cities in Italy and Malta are seeing their detail improved by photogrammetry, with the obvious choices of Rome, Milan and Venice joined by places such as Turin, Perugia and Paestum. Florence is a notable absence, but then Florence airport was recently released as paid DLC.

                              <span>The first premium membership skin is underwhelming at best
The Pokemon Unite membership program is now live, and sadly, it wasn&#x27;t really tweaked from its original leaked incarnation.
Now live worldwide, the Pokemon Unite membership program (called the &quot;Unite Club&quot;) costs $9.99 per month, which is a rather large disconnect compared to what other subscriptions offer. Here&#x27;s what you get:
A &quot;first time membership benefit&quot; of a trainer outfit
40 gems a day (more on that later)
One premium skin a month (more on that in a moment)
Additional unite licenses each week (read: a few more &quot;free rotation&quot; characters, which is useless if you own them all)
Trial Holowear (skins) each week
Special portrait frames and speech bubbles
10% off new fashion items
Don&#x27;t all cheer at once!
Naturally, these sorts of programs (like a similar one for Fortnite) come with a marquee monthly skin. And really, this is one of the most front-facing disappointing aspects of the Pokemon Unite membership. Like many Unite skins, this Greedent Holowear outfit can barely be considered a tweak from the original model.
Also, note this proviso: &quot;you will receive 40 Aeos gems daily as a login bonus.&quot; Digging into the FAQ, it&#x27;s important to note that even the membership program is a method of getting you to log in every day: &quot;If you log in and forget to claim the bonus or if the bonus resets without you logging in, you will not be able to receive Aeos gems for the missed day.&quot; The Fortnite membership service by comparison provides the equivalent of $10 worth of V-Bucks no questions asked, on a monthly basis (that isn&#x27;t drip-fed).
One more caveat to keep in mind: &quot;Club membership benefits can only be received on the platform used to join.&quot;
You can find a full FAQ on the membership here, if you are planning on getting it.

Publisher GungHo Online and developer Supertrick Games have announced that they will hold an open beta for their charismatic-looking &quot;multiplayer survival action game&quot; Deathverse: Let it Die, which is currently in development for PlayStation platforms with a tentative summer 2022 release window.
The &quot;Destroy the Server&quot; event is a one-day open beta set to take place on Saturday, May 28. Interested psychopaths can dive into the weird and violent world of futuristic game show Death Jamboree, battling it out with a variety of post-apocalyptic contestants, all under the watchful and highly excitable eyes of hosts Queen B and Bryan Zemeckis. Check out Deathverse&#x27;s wild world in the gameplay trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;dx58XTnmjOs
Set in 2026, as the planet rises from the aftermath of global conflict, Deathverse: Let it Die sees a populace seeking to quench its bloodlust through Death Jamboree&#x27;s consistent delivery of extreme violence. The show&#x27;s contestants — each sporting unique looks, skills, and abilities — utilize sci-fi weaponry, ethereal powers, and sometimes just good, old-fashioned right hooks in order to mash the opposition and take their place among the pantheon of Death Jamboree champions.
If you fancy your chances against a roster of retro-future warriors in the kill-or-be-killed world of Death Jamboree, then all you need do is pre-load the Deathverse: Let it Die module on either PS4 or PS5 ahead of the server&#x27;s launch, and you&#x27;ll be good to go. The chaos kicks off on May 28 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST until 19:00 PT / 22:00 ET / 03:00 BST. Of course, as the beta is designed specifically to stress test the servers, it may be host to various bugs and outages. A further test will be held on June 5.
Deathverse: Let it Die is scheduled to launch on PlayStation later in 2022.

                              <span>Time to step into the rink
Ubisoft&#x27;s extreme sports competition Roller Champions is finally rolling out. The competitive team sports game will go live next week on May 25 as a free-to-play title.
The action kicks off on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, as well as Xbox Series X|S and PS5 via backward compatibility. Roller Champions will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna, though it&#x27;ll be at a later date.
The roller derby action sports game Roller Champions was first announced by Ubisoft a few years ago. Ever since, it&#x27;s been rolling through a few technical tests and delays, popping up every now and then before disappearing into the night. Now, at least, the high-octane roller bash is finally debuting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fUAWz0jH1A4
The general flow of Roller Champions is two teams of roller skaters competing to reach five points. They pick up these points by racing laps around the arena with the ball in their possession, cashing them in when they dunk it in the goal. There&#x27;s wallriding, tackling, and general action-sports moves to cause chaos along the way.

Push it to the brink
It looks like Roller Champions will also have the features of most modern F2P games. Play online matches in quick play alone or with pals. There are maps to unlock and time-limited modes, as well as cosmetics to customize your avatar&#x27;s appearance. And of course, seasons with special cosmetics linked to them. The kickoff season starts the day Roller Champions launches.
The nice part is that Roller Champions isn&#x27;t just free-to-play, but also cross-play and cross-progression, so it&#x27;s easy enough to hop and check it out on any platform. There&#x27;s also some social hangout areas, with practice rinks and minigames. It&#x27;s a bit of a sudden surprise, but Ubisoft&#x27;s Roller Champions looks to finally put some wheels down in the arena next week.

                              <span>Director Yoji Fujito reassures fans the game is staying
Final Fantasy XI will continue, with the direct blessing of &quot;higher-ups&quot; at Square Enix, director Yoji Fujito revealed [via Siliconera] in a new Famitsu interview.
Addressing rumors that the game would shut down as early as this year, a brand new May 19 interview in the magazine confirms otherwise. The game&#x27;s director Yoji Fujito notes that people shouldn&#x27;t be worried about that happening &quot;anytime soon,&quot; and that &quot;higher-ups&quot; are informing Fujito and his team to &quot;continue on&quot; with the game.
It&#x27;s good news for fans to get short-term confirmation, but it also seems like the game isn&#x27;t even on the chopping block at this time. So just how long will it go on? Well, only Square Enix management can say. But even if it ended next week, 20 years is quite the run!
At the moment, the two MMOs seem like an important part of Square Enix&#x27;s portfolio. While Final Fantasy XIV is obviously more successful, the publisher sees value in their internal IP, and generally treats the Final Fantasy series with reverence (barring some port job quality control), and plays the long game. If something hasn&#x27;t been re-released or remastered in a while, they&#x27;ll make you remember it — or promote it in some way.

The first Overwatch 2 PvP beta is over, and while it didn&#x27;t leave much of an impression on some of us, there&#x27;s still hope that the next phase will be a more concrete step up — and ideally, Blizzard will be able to include console players next time, too. For now, the team is taking a (relative) step back and planning to return in one month with big news on June 16.
As shared in a blog post, Blizzard wants players to &quot;save the date&quot; for an Overwatch 2 event on June 16 that will include &quot;more information on how to gain access to the next phase of Overwatch 2 testing.&quot; Expect to hear the &quot;plan for the months ahead.&quot;

We could be hearing more about Square Enix&#x27;s plans for Final Fantasy VII fairly soon. Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura says that some FFVII news is in store for next month.
During a Japanese-language livestream about battle royale Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Nomura said news is on the way regarding the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII for June, next month. (Translation via VGC and @aitaikimochi on Twitter.)
The comment doesn&#x27;t seem to have any more specifics, in terms of what this means related to Final Fantasy VII. Hopes would be high that this signals some news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, but there could also be other projects in the works.

Change your fate
The first installment of Final Fantasy VII Remake landed in 2020, after a long wait for its eventual drop. And the interstitial update Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade landed a year later, adding some extra Yuffie content to the fold.
Wherever Part 2 of Final Fantasy VII Remake is, chances are good it&#x27;s still in the works. Some confirmation of what&#x27;s coming though, and especially how the team plans to tackle the story after Cloud and the gang leave Midgar, would be interesting to see.
It sounds like a decent chunk of Final Fantasy XVI news is on the way. Producer Naoki Yoshida recently said a new trailer is on the way for the next big numbered installment in Final Fantasy.
With Summer Game Fest just around the corner, chances of some Final Fantasy news showing up seem high. Square Enix hasn&#x27;t announced any of its own plans as of this writing, nor has Sony or Nintendo. Xbox and Bethesda are hosting their joint showcase on June 12. Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest Live stream kicks off on June 9.

                              <span>That&#x27;s a lot of road trip money
It&#x27;s hard to believe that Final Fantasy XV is in the rear-view mirror of the Regalia. This is a game where I once had to create a giant checklist to keep track of all of the demos, cross-media projects, DLC, and crossovers. Well, as of this week Square Enix reports that Final Fantasy XV sales have hit a new milestone of 10 million units worldwide.
Square Enix &quot;thanks fans for their continued support&quot; for the game. And continued support it has gotten, from a certain point of view! Even as recently as the past few years, there&#x27;s been crossovers with other games, including a recurring Final Fantasy XIV event. In a sense, this game refused to die, and earned that 10 million through sheer force of will. I&#x27;m not just talking about the cross-media projects either. Two years after launch it came to PC, where it was met with a flourishing modding community. Then it arrived on Stadia a year later.
Final Fantasy XV is polarizing still, I get it. It has what I can only describe as &quot;Final Fantasy VIII energy,&quot; which was also polarizing at the time, and a mixed legacy that endures to this day. Playing through it in a bubble before all the controversy, DLC, and post-launch content delays, I found it to be exceedingly relaxing, among other things. In the eternal &quot;Final Fantasy rankings&quot; debate that&#x27;s been going on since I can remember (Final Fantasy VI kind of sealed that top spot at release though, and for some, even still): it&#x27;ll probably end up somewhere in the middle.

                              <span>A Striker, a Berserker, and a Dragon Knight walk into a bar...
Publisher Nexon has released a very short video offering the first glimpses of the story mode for its upcoming fighter, DNF Duel. The anime scrapper, which launches on PlayStation and PC next month, will see the classes of MMO Dungeon Fighter Online gather for some solid one-on-one slugfestin&#x27;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;QV7yyGP0YgM&amp;t
Even from this short video, we can already see that DNF Duel will feature the deep lore and delightful melodrama of its MMO source material. In the clip, we see Berserker going, umm, berserk, the spritely Striker dodging trouble in the woods, and the noble Dragon Knight having a bit of a lie-down. The scenes have full voice acting and sport some very nice, comic-book style artwork. In addition, the new trailer also includes a look at a gallery mode, as well as an in-game glossary — no doubt to help newcomers get up to speed in the world of Dungeon Fighter Online.
DNF Duel, first revealed back in the winter of 2020, has spent the past year turning heads with its dramatic and action-packed trailers, rad character designs, and promises of enthralling battles powered by silky-smooth rollback connections. Recent betas, (poorly timed to coincide with other popular betas and game releases), did not exactly set the FGC alight, but many players found enjoyment in DNF Duel&#x27;s specific brand of fantasy carnage. Having covered the title every step of the way since its initial reveal, I&#x27;m very anxious to check out the scrappy underdog in its final form.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC June 28.

                              <span>Monster Hunter has the top spot, but Resident Evil spreads the wealth
Resident Evil Village sales numbers have been touted by Capcom for a while now, but thanks to a refresh of the &quot;Platinum Titles&quot; investor relations page, we have an updated look at how it stacks up to everything else. The Capcom all-time seller list still has Monster Hunter: World in a commanding lead, but there&#x27;s plenty of Resident Evil to go around.
The vast majority of the list has stayed the same, with one notable exception. So Monster Hunter: Rise jumped up from a previous spot of number seven overall to number five. This pushed down Resident Evil 5 and 6, which both remain on the list. Resident Evil Village managed to crack the top 10 previously and had sales figures of 5.7 million units, and now it pushed up to 6.10, further poised to take the ninth spot from Street Fighter V. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.
I expect the next update to shake things up a bit more. We could see the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak DLC take up a spot with its own SKU, and it&#x27;ll be bolstered by a dual launch on both PC and Switch.
Capcom all-time seller list as of May 18, 2022:
Monster Hunter: World: 18 million units
Resident Evil 7: 10.8m
Resident Evil 2 (Remake): 9.6m
Monster Hunter World: Iceborne: 9.2m
Monster Hunter Rise: 9m
Resident Evil 5: 8.2m
Resident Evil 6: 8.2m
Street Fighter II: 6.3m
Street Fighter V: 6.2m
Resident Evil Village: 6.1m

                              <span>&#x27;Ambitious&#x27; fantasy epic will be an entirely new IP
Dying Light developer Techland has announced that it is in the early stages of developing a brand new fantasy RPG for modern gaming platforms. The mystery project will see Techland team up with a party of developers who formerly worked at The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt RED.
While very few details have been released in regards to the new title, Techland notes that it will be a brand new IP, set within a sweeping otherworldly universe. It is also suggested that the new game will be developed specifically for the more powerful platforms on the market, and will be vastly different in scope and design from anything Techland has done before.
&quot;We’re very happy with what we have accomplished with the Dying Light franchise so far…</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t make a bloody mess
Ambitious, brooding, stylish, and messy, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong feels right at home with the eternal undead it follows.
It takes the narrative adventure style, mixes it with tabletop RPG and some pen-and-paper puzzle solving, and comes away with something fresh. It just also stumbles a few times on its way there.
The Vampire brand has been slowly upping its presence in video games over the past few years. Alongside the slew of visual novels and a nebulous in-development Bloodlines sequel, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is an interesting new entrant. When it shines, it really feels like the better parts of playing a tabletop campaign. It&#x27;s the stutters in-between that cause the most trouble.

[Update: Pokemon Home Legends support (and BDSP) is just around the corner, as the official Pokemon account has informed users of a Home maintenance period later today at 5:00PM PT. It&#x27;s expected that sometime in the early morning of May 18, US time, the 2.0 update will be completed.]
[Update #2: It&#x27;s complete! You can now update to Home 2.0.]
Pokemon Home Legends support is on the way, along with the addition of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), a new blog has announced.
The Pokemon Company is calling this &quot;Home 2.0,&quot; and in short, all roads will lead to Home now; including the prior supported Pokemon Sword/Shield, Let&#x27;s Go Eevee/Pikachu, Pokemon Go, and the Pokemon Bank, on top of the aforementioned new additions.
Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of how boxes will be filed:
&quot;Until now, the only Pokedex in Pokemon Home was the National Pokedex. But starting from version 2.0.0, the Pokedex from each game will be added.​ Pokemon in your Boxes in Pokemon Home will be registered in their respective game&#x27;s Pokedex after version 2.0.0 of Pokemon Home is installed.​ Pokemon that aren&#x27;t in a Box when the ver. 2.0.0 update is installed, such as those that have been traded away, will not be registered.&quot;

Interestingly, when Pokemon are transferred to or from Pokemon Legends, they will be found in &quot;strange balls&quot; due to the lore differences and time jump considerations. Those are pretty much the only provisos you need to be aware of.
And here&#x27;s the list of promo items you&#x27;ll get:
By depositing a BDSP Pokemon into Home Switch: Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup with Hidden Abilities as Mystery Gifts in Home mobile
By depositing a Pokemon from Legends into Home Switch: Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawott with maximum effort levels as Mystery Gifts in Home mobile
A final date has not been announced, but many expect it to arrive this month, which would be inline with similar announcement timelines.

Bohemia Interactive has revealed a brand new title in its military shooter franchise, Arma. Now in Early Access on PC and Xbox Series X, Arma Reforger will serve as a &quot;stepping stone&quot; of sorts to the upcoming Arma 4, which is also currently in development at the Czech gaming studio.
Arma Reforger will serve two purposes for both the developer and the Arma community. Firstly, it will provide a standalone, open-world adventure with which to lay both the background, mood, and gameplay of the next mainline sequel. Secondly, it will allow players, modders, and the developer itself to get to grips with the all-new Enfusion engine, which hopes to provide the series with its tightest, most immersive, and most thrilling experience to date.

                              <span>They&#x27;ll (literally) tear your heart out
Today, Behaviour Interactive hosted a sixth anniversary stream for its asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight. And amidst the doom and gloom, there was one surprising reveal: a Dead by Daylight dating sim called Hooked on You. Yes, a dating sim for dating the Killers of Dead by Daylight.
It might seem unreal but it is, somehow, a real actual dating sim arriving this summer. Last year, Behaviour Interactive asked players in a survey what kind of spinoff they&#x27;d like to see from Dead by Daylight, and the answer was a dating sim. So Psyop, the developer behind the Colonel Sanders dating sim, is stepping in to make a killer dating sim.
According to the official site, Hooked on You whisks the player away to Murderer&#x27;s Island. There, they&#x27;ll have the chance to get to know four drop-dead Killers and flirt with them, uncovering some dark twists along the way. The Trapper, Huntress, Wraith, and Spirit make up the four romanceable Killers in this tropical paradise. Well, paradise for now.

Island in the sun
Picking the right dialogue options will let you get to know the Killers, as well as gradually unlock more about them. Psyop and Behaviour are boasting multiple endings for each Killer. And nicely enough, they range from true love to platonic friendship and even bitter loathing. Love to have a little bit of realism in my dating sim.
No date&#x27;s been set yet for Hooked on You, and right now it&#x27;s only confirmed as coming to Steam. But an overall Very Positive ranking on Steam as of this writing for the KFC dating sim seems to indicate that Psyop knows what it&#x27;s doing in the realm of virtual courtship. We&#x27;ll see if Hooked on You&#x27;s love is a killer later on this summer.

Have you ever done that thing where you&#x27;ve played a game too much, and then when you go out into the real world, you find yourself wishing you could use a game mechanic in real life? The example that always comes to mind for me is Breath of the Wild.
I first played it when I was in college in South Carolina, and because I lived near the Blue Ridge Parkway, I was also going on a lot of hikes at the time. Now when I got to the top of the mountain, I kept having this impulse to want to jump off, because of course my paraglider would take me safely to the ground below. Thankfully I never gave into that impulse, but I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about how fun it would have been to actually get to just pull a glider out of my pocket and enjoy a nice ride with a beautiful view…</span>

                              <span>Google na začátku roku oznámil, že ukončí podporu původní služby G Suite zdarma. Uživatelé měli buď odejít nebo přejít na placenou službu Workspace. Poté se začalo hovořit o tom, že firma připravuje zvláštní nabídku pro osobní použití a nakonec se z ní vyklubala omezená varianta Workspace Essentials Starter bez GMailu. Řadě uživatelů se ale tato varianta nelíbila, proto migrovali na jiná řešení.</span>

Most of the information Bohemia had to relay was leaked over the weekend on Reddit, but it’s always good to get official confirmation of these things, amirite?

                              <span>The devastatingly stylish first-person photography game Umurangi Generation arrived on Game Pass today, so here&#x27;s me to nudge you to try one of our favourite games of 2020 (and 2021&#x27;s IGF Grand Prize winner). I can&#x27;t think of many other games which have you photographing scenes of daily life and struggle amidst a Neon Genesis Evangelion-grade cataclysmic kaiju event. It looks and sounds fantastic, too, with cool Jet Set Radio vibes.

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.

Stray Blade was first touted on the Xbox stream at last year’s Gamescom but it’s been in development for several years at the Berlin-based developers. The game stars an anthropologist who’s been sucked through a magic portal and dumped in the ‘Valley of Acrea’ with a little scarf-wearing wolf called Boji for company.

Now, the Ryzen 5 5600X is retailing for just £185 at Currys in the UK when you use the code FNDDGAMING, bringing a heretofore unseen level of performance to this price point.

Middling art sits atop a generic description that does its very best to not sell the game. &quot;Hunt for blood in nearby settlements... conquer the land of the living.&quot; Alrighteyyy, then. Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.
So, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you&#x27;ve closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.

                              <span>I’ve always been terrible at games. Truly. Trying to join in with any online multiplayer game has been met with quotes such as, &quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; and, &quot;Wow, 84 deaths? Really?&quot;, to name but a few. This led to scenarios where it felt far easier for me to give up and try something new. But when the point of the game is to continue dying over and over again to up my knowledge, skill level, abilities and unlock new weapons and perks?

                              <span>Mediatonic’s bean-themed party royale Fall Guys will go free-to-play on June 21st, the studio announced last night. However, this will also coincide with the game being delisted from Steam. From that point on, Fall Guys will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, although it will still remain playable for existing owners on Steam without them having to move to Epic&#x27;s launcher. The news came as part of Mediatonic’s announcement that Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox next month with full cross-play and cross-progression support, alongside its current homes on PC and PlayStation.

Pokud už používáte Fedora 36 Workstation, asi jste si všimli, že vzhled aplikací není tak konzistentní jako dřív. Aplikace, které jsou už portované na GTK 4 mají &quot;ploché&quot; téma vzhledu definované knihovnou libadwaita. Aplikace používající GTK 3 zůstávají u původního tématu Adwaita.</span>

Another wave of games is headed to Xbox Game Pass this month, and a good number of them hit today. The back-half of May has some pretty interesting offerings; not as many big AAA hits, but some indie gems that are very worth your time.
Leading the charge is Jurassic World Evolution 2, the sequel to Frontier&#x27;s original dino-park management sim. It&#x27;s got a new campaign and, of course, plenty of new dinosaurs to keep in their pens. You&#x27;re going to keep them in their pens, right?
The indies are especially out in full force for May, though. Sam Barlow&#x27;s FMV text-search mystery Her Story joins the PC Game Pass lineup.

                              <span>I would too, if I had a PS5
When the PS5 was first announced, some fans were shocked to find that the console was going to be white, which was Sony&#x27;s first time deviating from a black color scheme for the PlayStation since the gray original console released back in 1994. Thankfully, if you&#x27;re not a fan of a brighter look, Sony has also released different console covers and controllers in a variety of colors. First they released Midnight Black and Cosmic Red colors for the console covers back in January of this year (you know, those being the classic gamer colors), but now there are some new variations on the horizon.
Introducing the Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink console covers. Ooh, aah. The covers are available for both the disc-based and digital-only versions of the PS5, and are available now for pre-order for $54.99 each. While the official release date for the covers is June 17, the matching controllers are also now up for sale, going for a staggering $74.99. I guess it costs to look that good.

Personally, I love the fun-colored consoles — if this thing is going to sit in plain view, something Sony seemed to want us to do based on the &quot;artistic&quot; design of the PS5, I at least like the option of being able to customize what it looks like. I had the limited edition Uncharted 4 PS4 for a while and loved it, so I&#x27;m waiting for the day I can get my hands on another console with a fun design, given they make PS5s like that... or that I can get a PS5 at all. At this point, I&#x27;ve waited so long to buy one legitimately, I have no idea when I&#x27;ll have an opportunity to purchase a PS5.
Oh well, in the mean time it&#x27;s fun to look at the pretty colors, right?

ININ Games has announced a release date for its upcoming retro compendium Wonder Boy Collection. The quartet of qutesy adventures will be available to purchase on PS4 and Nintendo Switch from June 3, available in both digital and physical formats.
Developed by indie outfit Bliss Brain, the Wonder Boy Collection features four titles pulled from the legendary adventures of Ryuichi Nishizawa&#x27;s fantasy explorer. First on the agenda is 1986&#x27;s Wonder Boy, which tasks players with guiding our caveman hero through the slippiest, skiddiest platform adventure ever designed. The second title is 1987&#x27;s Wonder Boy in Monster Land, a classic arcade actioner that introduced typical RPG elements, as well as a fantasy-themed sword-and-sorcery universe.
https://youtu.be/36dXydzrNvc
Next up is the 1991 arcade Wonder Boy in Monster World, in which the adventurous Shion is guided by four friendly spirits on a quest to defeat the troublesome BioMeka and their army of magical monsters. The fourth title in Wonder Boy Collection is 1994&#x27;s Monster World IV, which sees new protagonist Asha set out to rescue the four friendly spirits captured by a roving party of evil sorcerers. This entry remained confined to the Sega Mega Drive platform until its latter-day re-release on Nintendo Wii, followed by a full remake in 2020.
While a pretty fun package of titles, it can&#x27;t be denied that — for licensing and other reasons — so much is missing here. Wonder Boy Collection does not feature the best game in the series, 1989&#x27;s Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap, nor does it feature the legendary home ports of the first three titles, the Dotemu remakes, nor 2018&#x27;s pseudo-sequel Monster Boy and The Cursed Kingdom. As such, it&#x27;s difficult for ININ Games to warrant that &quot;Collection&quot; moniker.
Wonder Boy Collection launches on PS4 and Nintendo Switch June 3.

Capcom has released a series of new trailers for Sunbreak, the upcoming DLC expansion for the popular fantasy-adventure Monster Hunter Rise. The videos focus on some of the tools and weapons that savvy explorers will be sure to pack before venturing out into the treacherous wildlands.

First on the agenda is the fantasy staple: The Sword &amp; Shield. Combining both strong offensive and defensive options, this two-hand treasure has long been a trope of fantasy fiction, from the oldest of written fables to the most modern RPGs. In Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the Sword &amp; Shield combo provides the ability to strike hard in close combat, while retaining mobility and having several defensive options — a solid balanc…</span>

Developer The Bearded Ladies has a new project with some familiar vibes. The Mutant Year Zero team announced their new project today, called Miasma Chronicles, a post-apocalyptic tactical adventure.
Debuting during this morning&#x27;s 505 Games Spring 2022 Showcase, Miasma Chronicles takes place in a post-apocalyptic America where a force called the Miasma has rolled over the country.
The protagonist Elvis lives in the care of a robotic older brother, along with a glove that can control the Miasma. The pair sets off on a quest to find answers and, likely, contend with the Miasma in the process.

                              <span>&quot;Nearly 100 amazing indie games&quot; lined up for this year&#x27;s Wholesome Direct showcase
There&#x27;s not enough time to hear about (much less play) all of the worthwhile video games in the collective cooker, and even if we narrow down our scope to certain genres or moods, our brains can only hang onto so much information at once. But we can try! So while June is going to be another busy month for live-streamed game showcases, I&#x27;ve once again got my eye on the Wholesome Direct, a celebration of cute and cozy upcoming indie games.
The Wholesome Direct is back for 2022, and the event is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Pacific on June 11. Here&#x27;s a teaser trailer with a preview of some of the curated games.

Do you remember, way back in 2020, before The Launch We Shall Not Speak Of, Netflix and CD Projekt RED announced a new anime series set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe? Well, remember it or not, Netflix is finally ready to start talking about it again, and will premiere new footage during June&#x27;s Geeked Week 2022 event.
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a 10-episode series from Studio Trigger, the anime veterans behind popular shows Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Star Wars: Visions. While we have heard very little from the tie-in TV show since Cyberpunk 2077 had its less-than-sparkling release, the original plot outline saw a young punk with nothing to lose divert his life into that of a cybersecurity mercenary, or &quot;Edgerunner.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XRvDL9FChFM
Since then, we have heard little and seen nothing in regard to the new anime, so Geeked Week will provide the perfect opportunity for Netflix and Trigger to show off the sci-fi adventure, especially now that the furor behind Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s launch has, for the most part, died down entirely. In addition to Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, fans will get to see new trailers, cast interviews, and reveals pertaining to other video game adaptations such as the live-action Resident Evil series and the second season of the unfortunately disappointing The Cuphead Show.
If you want to be there for all of the hot gossip on the above shows, not to mention the many other releases Netflix has lined up for its 2022-2023 season — including Stranger Things, The Sandman, Spiderhead, Umbrella Academy, and The Sea Beast — then be sure to tune into Geeked Week 2022, which will run from Monday, June 6 to Friday, June 10.

And whatever they don&#x27;t own, they can likely lock down a deal for: like the upcoming Lord of the Rings set, and the recent Street Fighter crossover. So when Dungeons and Dragons or Baldur&#x27;s Gate is involved, people perk up. That includes the Baldur&#x27;s Gate Commander set, which we were given a brief look at recently.
The next Commander Legends set is Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, and it&#x27;s out on June 10 (with a pre-release session from June 3 through June 5). The big focus this time is features from past sets, like the &quot;dungeon&quot; mechanic from Forgotten Realms (with just the Undercity dungeon card, with the intent to possibly share one…</span>

                              <span>Manana and Riku
With Xenoblade Chronicles 3 quickly approaching in July, Nintendo is sharing a ton of info rapidly, including the playable Nopons that will appear in your party.
In case you haven&#x27;t played a Xenoblade Chronicles game before (which is understandable, as you can jump into any of them), Nopons are the core &quot;cute&quot; race of the series, not unlike a lot of other anime productions. They&#x27;re typically goofy, but they also fight, and sometimes serve a larger role in the overarching plot.
As far as Xenoblade Chronicles 3 goes, first up is Manana, who is &quot;always thinking about food.&quot; It&#x27;s not just for lore flavor either, as they&#x27;ll serve as the cook of the party, and they sport a &quot;cheerful personality.&quot;
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1526099318578421760
Then there&#x27;s Riku, who is one of the most stoic Nopons we&#x27;ve seen to date. They&#x27;ll &quot;maintain your weapons&quot; as the smith, and one of his defining traits is his ability to keep his cool. That calm demeanor and that Japanese voice in the video below are a thing of wonder. I&#x27;m already counting on adding them to my party ahead of time. I love it when that happens with a JRPG.

                              <span>Yo dawg, I heard you like subscriptions...
Following on from yesterday&#x27;s update on the revamped PlayStation Plus service, publisher Ubisoft has announced that it plans to bring its own paid subscription service, Ubisoft+, to PlayStation platforms.
The service, already available on PC, Stadia, and Luna devices, includes over 100 titles from the Ubisoft catalog, including games from the Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and Watch Dogs franchises. The paid service also includes classics from Ubisoft&#x27;s past, including titles such as Beyond Good and Evil, Prince of Persia, Child of Light, The Settlers, and Silent Hunter.
In addition to offering full Ubisoft+ subscriptions to PlayStation players, Ubisoft is looking to offer a scaled-down version of its package for inclusion in the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription. This will include the Ubisoft+ Classics collection, which hopes to compile a continuously expanding range of 50 classic titles — all of which will be made available to download for all PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers.
Ubisoft had originally announced its intention to bring the Ubisoft+ service to Xbox, but has yet to offer a date for this endeavor. You can read further details on the revamped PlayStation Plus service in our previous articles. The new PlayStation Plus service is expected to launch next month, though Ubisoft did not offer a timeline for its own subscription inclusion plans.

                              <span>Plus 24 &quot;immersive core&quot; games
At least eight new Take-Two remasters or ports are set for release, according to a new financial report (fiscal 2022 results) from the publisher. This is all part of a massive section of Take-Two&#x27;s &quot;pipeline,&quot; which extends all the way from this current fiscal year of 2023 to 2025.
Take-Two not only shed some light on its plans to bring back the past, but what it&#x27;s doing in the future. Let&#x27;s take a brief look at its set of fully confirmed games.

Here are the games Take-Two is touting as part of its announced lineup:
The Quarry — June 10, 2022
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns — Second half of 2022
Kerbal Space Program 2 — 2023 on PC, consoles at a later date
GTA -Definitive Edition mobile — FY2023
New Tales from the Borderlands game — FY2023
As far as everything else goes, there will be 24 &quot;immersive core&quot; games, which most industry analysts would call &quot;AAA&quot; or thereabouts. Then there&#x27;s 10 independent [indie] projects, 20 mobile games, seven &quot;mid-core&quot; titles (Tales from the Borderlands is cited as a direct example), and eight &quot;new iterations of previously released titles.&quot; Take-Two clarifies that &quot;this includes ports and remastered titles: sequels would not fall into this category.&quot;
Of course, the elephant in the room is GTA Trilogy - Definitive Edition. There&#x27;s a question of how many times Take-Two can fool potential remaster buyers if they aren&#x27;t going to put the work in to polish a re-release. Of course, Take-Two is a massive company, and any number of remasters can be handled by a wide array of studios. But as a whole, it would behoove them to put their best foot forward if they want to continue down this path and keep their reputation intact.

                              <span>But I found some anyway
Good Smile Company&#x27;s range of pint-sized Nendoroid figures are well known for their wholesome adorability... But I think this latest effort takes things to a whole new level of cuteness. The intrepid Aloy — protagonist of Guerrilla Games&#x27; acclaimed Horizon franchise — is taking aim at your heart and wallet.

Like the many Nendoroid releases before her, Aloy stands a dinky four inches in height and comes sculpted in high-quality painted PVC plastic. Aloy comes packaged with three faceplates: a sweet grin, a little grumpy roar, and a winking/aiming expression. Aloy comes loaded for bear with her trusty spear, bow &amp; arrow, and even a power-enhancing Focus segment. As a cool little extra, the Aloy Nendoroid also comes with a super-scaled-down version of the reconnaissance machine: The Watcher.

While Nendoroids are well known for their fun detailing and petite nature, Aloy here has really captured my heart, and might be my favorite Nendo since Overwatch&#x27;s Sombra, which debuted way back in 2018. If fancy an Aloy for your very own, then you can pre-order the new Nendoroid over on the official Good Smile Co. website. Aloy will retail for ¥6,500 (or roughly $50 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges, and she is expected to ship in October of this year.
Oh, and if you want even more Horizon goodies for your bookshelf, then be sure to check out the recent Horizon Forbidden West set from The LEGO Company, which hit high street shelves just last week.

                              <span>Can you keep a secret?
A scant minute of footage has been released from Sega&#x27;s upcoming compendium Sonic Origins, which is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. The clip gives fans a sneak peek of some of the title&#x27;s features ahead of its official release on June 23.
The video, which debuted as part of the Rulicon broadcast in South Korea, offers a whistlestop tour of Sonic Origins, including a look at the game&#x27;s menu screens, as well as short clips from Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 (w/Sonic and Knuckles), and Sonic CD. We see The Blue Blur in action alongside compadres Tails, Knuckles, and even his final form, Super Sonic — accessible in all included Sonic titles.
The clip also gives us a look at the Hidden Palace Zone, a secret stage that was cut from the original 1992 release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and will be returning as a part of Sonic Origins. The compendium will also boast new intro and ending sequences, new modes and challenges, and a host of unlockables for the nostalgic in-game museum. Sonic Origins hopes to be a definitive collection of the 16-bit adventures that defined a legend, and is looking to be a must-buy for any Sonic fan willing to negotiate its bizarre pre-order shenanigans.
Sonic Origins launches June 23 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

When a game has some unforeseen breakout success, it&#x27;s not uncommon to see imitators. And that might be what you think 20 Minutes Till Dawn and its demo, 10 Minutes Till Dawn, are at first glance. The good news is that they&#x27;re a fair bit more than imitations of another game. They&#x27;re surprisingly in-depth, with their own spins and ideas, and certainly one to keep an eye on.
Vampire Survivors managed to reach a pretty incredible level of success for a Steam indie project earlier this year. Its mix of careful movement, idle weapon blasting, and upgrading weapons made for an excellent break-time game. I burned many, many lunch breaks on unlocking all the upgrades. And as a cursory look at Steam tells me, there are already a few imitators …</span>

                              <span>Well, as good as a PS1 game can look these days
Horizon Zero Dawn has become one of the most popular and beloved games of the current console generation for PlayStation, and its recent sequel has proven to hold up against its predecessor. While we can see how far the series has come over just two games when it comes to its tech and mechanics, part of us also has to wonder what Horizon would have looked like back in the day... in say 1996, for example.
A YouTuber by the name of ZeoNyph has answered that question for us, because they made a short video previewing what Zero Dawn might look like as a PS1 game. It&#x27;s a minute-long clip featuring the PS1 bootup sequence, the game&#x27;s demade title screen, Aloy climbing a wall, and then subsequently dying to a Watcher in a very early PlayStation-esque fashion. It&#x27;s only a small sampling of what the game might have looked like back in the day, but it sure is a convincing one.

I think there&#x27;s something comforting about seeing a game we love in the graphics of generations past — and there&#x27;s something thematically relevant in there about seeing Horizon rendered for obsolete technology, right?
This also isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve seen a favorite game like Horizon as a PS1 demake — Bloodborne also got that treatment last year. Not only did fans make a video of a demade Bloodborne, but they also created a fully playable fan game of it that runs all the way through the first two bosses. The project took 13 months of development to complete, and understandably so, because it looks incredible. Now here&#x27;s hoping Horizon might get the same treatment, because there&#x27;s certainly much more of that game to see as a PS1 demake. I for one would love to see some low-poly Tallnecks.

                              <span>Today’s reveal of Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim has unsurprisingly and understandably elicited a mixture of surprise, confusion, and flat-out ridicule. I won’t tell anyone that either emotion is invalid, but I do take exception to the sentiment that established franchises should stay in their lane and aren’t allowed to stretch their wings to other genres. After all, several of the best games and even series were spawned when their creators flexed an IP’s versatility. So before you write off a Dead by Daylight visual novel, here are just a few examples – not a definitive list or ranking – of other wild spin-offs that became big success stories in their own right.

                              <span>Today’s Dead by Daylight 6th Anniversary livestream brought a lot of exciting announcements, but none were stranger or more surprising than the reveal of Hooked on You. This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.
If you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. 


“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”
Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.</span>

Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate brings D&amp;D flavor back to Magic: The Gathering in a fully draftable set focused on the Commander format.
Like the previous Adventures in the Forgotten Realms set from last summer, Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate let&#x27;s Magic players step foot into the existing role-playing world of Forgotten Realms, but with a tighter focus on the settlement of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. The set takes inspiration from the D&amp;D rulebooks and adventures and uses locations and characters from Bioware&#x27;s classic Baldur&#x27;s Gate video games and Larian Studio&#x27;s upcoming Baldur&#x27;s Gate III.

Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.

The sting of another death fades as I attempt to shake off my nerves. I’m preparing to clash with a Sanguimancer I’ve tried to slay a dozen times. Maybe I’ll learn something new as I dash back into the fray, though I’ve been down this path many times on prior hunts, and I know I’m more likely to survive on sheer luck than anything else. Salt and Sacrifice often leaves me lacking a feeling of accomplishment and, in the process, sullies the promising additions like its bounties and crafting systems.
After choosing a class from a handful of options and customizing my gloomy mar…</span>

The game, which does not yet have a title, is officially being referred to as a “AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting,” and today’s concept art reveal highlights just that. Featuring luscious greenery, ancient ruins, and plenty of beautiful waterfalls, it seems this fantasy RPG will be quite the looker if the concept art is any indication. Techland released the concept art below as a way to let developers know that the studio is hiring and that dozens of positions are open for work on this RPG. 
Techland says the development team is led by key figures behind some of the &quot;biggest RPGs in modern history,&quot; including the narrative di…</span>

                              <span>A blog post on the official Epic Games website announced that the incoming v20.40 update allows V-bucks purchased on PlayStation to be accessed across all viable platforms. This correlates with Fortnite&#x27;s Shared Wallet system, which is currently available on Xbox, PC, Android, and cloud gaming services. 
For this to work, players need to confirm that their PlayStation account is linked to their Epic Games account. And for anyone who&#x27;s not currently using Fortnite Wallet but is interested in it, you&#x27;ll need to follow the step above and link your platform&#x27;s account to Epic. Sadly, the Shared Wallet feature is still unavailable on Switch, so V-Bucks acquired on other platforms can&#x27;t be transferred to Nintendo’s beloved handheld. 
V-Bucks are earned from the Battle Pass, Quest Packs, or Save the World game mode. Click the link above for the Fortnite Wallet FAQ and any additional information.

The event revealed three new games and a quick look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising. 
It began with Among The Trolls, a new folklore survival game, then Stray Blade, a magic combat action RPG, and then a look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising, which was released last week, before ending with a quick tease of a game called Miasma Chronicles, developed by Mutant Year Zero developer The Bearded Ladies.
Let’s break each of the new games down: 
Among The Trolls
The trailer for Among The Trolls sets up this survival game as somewhat spooky, or at least mysterious. Your goal is to survive in a forest that’s home to creatures…</span>

                              <span>Things are ramping up for Take-Two Interactive as a new financial report details the publisher&#x27;s IP plans for the next three years. According to Nintendo Life, many projects are in the works, from those already announced to undisclosed titles. Ultimately, the report revealed over 30 games are in the works, including, but not limited to, new ports and remasters. 
The full report, which can be read here, categorizes the upcoming games and provides clear definitions for each:
Immersive Core: Titles that have the deepest gameplay and the most hours of content. Examples include our key sports franchises (like PGA 2K and NBA 2K) as well as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption (to name a few). 
Independent: Externally developed Private Division releases. 
Mobile: Any title released on a mobile platform.
Mid-core: Titles that are either an arcade title (like WWE Battlegrounds) or games that have many hours of gameplay, but not to the same extent as an immersive core title. 
New iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.
Moreover, a pipeline table in the document states Take-Two is developing 24 immersive core games, including The Quarry for June 10, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns later this year, Kerbal Space Program 2 (PC) in early 2023, and NBA2K23, PGA Tour 2K23, and WWE 2K23 next year. Ten independent games, 20 mobile games like the GTA Trilogy in 2023, 7 mid-core games, including the long-awaited Tales from the Borderlands sequel, and eight new iterations of prior releases are also on the way. Fans of Take-Two&#x27;s many development studios undoubtedly have a lot to look forward to. 
It&#x27;s hard to guess the future for some of these categories, but what ports and remasters are you anticipating? Perhaps we&#x27;ll get to play a modernized Bully port! Let us know what you&#x27;re positing in the comments below!

On April 16, an FFXIV maintenance update indicated that the latest lottery cycle for housing in-game was broken, so when checking the placard where winners were to be shown, the placard said there were no winners. This meant nobody could obtain a house. Polygon reports the issue has been fixed as of yesterday, and now, winning lottery numbers will be displayed correctly, and land purchases may be finalized accordingly. 
“As I mentioned in our previous update, we will be conducting maintenance to restore lottery results data on Monday, May 16,” FFXIV producer and director Naoki Yoshida writes in a new update. “This maintenance will fix identified errors and properly relay lottery results for affected plot…</span>

Summed up, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is a simple and straightforward action/RPG. It’s easy to get lost in its tranquil cycle of collecting stamps via fetch quests and combat. However, Rising doesn’t have much substance. The whole experience is bland and commits various RPG transgressions, which is disappointing. Especially as it’s a prequel introducing the Eiyuden world ahead of Eiyuden Chronicle: A Hundred Heroes – a spiritual successor to the Suikoden series.

                              <span>Kerbal Space Program 2 will remain grounded a while longer. Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.
Creative director Nate Simpson explained on the project&#x27;s forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: 
“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” 


Like its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. 
Kerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.
Unfortunately, Kerbal isn&#x27;t the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a big couple of weeks for MultiVersus, with the announcement of a big Evo tournament a few days ago, the first gameplay demonstration along with that announcement, and the game goes into a new round of closed alpha testing this week. But the news for Warner Bros.&#x27; brawler doesn&#x27;t stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.
Looney Toons&#x27; Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo&#x27;s Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week&#x27;s alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won&#x27;t make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.
A later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you&#x27;re not able to get into the closed alpha, you&#x27;ll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. 
If you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game&#x27;s website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.</span>

Each episode leaves me increasingly perplexed as I’ve watched from week to week. I’m a longtime Halo player, a fervent sci-fi fan, and a dedicated gamer; I should be the target audience for this long-awaited adaptation. And all the pieces feel like they are in place for a good time. The meticulously reproduced versions of Covenant and UNSC weapons and ships, the overwhelming power of a Spartan on the battlefield, and the semi-mystical nature of ancient artifacts related to the Halo – these are all the sorts of things fans should want, right?

                              <span>Fall Guys, the popular obstacle course-based multiplayer game, is going free-to-play on June 21. 
Mediatonic, the developer behind Fall Guys, announced this today in a special livestream for the game. June 21 will also see the launch of Season 1 and Fall Guys&#x27; long-awaited arrival to Xbox platforms, Switch, and the Epic Games Store. 


In fact, to prepare for this shift to free-to-play, Mediatonic says PS4 players will need to download a new version of the game that’s available now. All of your existing cosmetics and crowns will transfer over. When the Xbox version of the game goes live, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will gain access to the first of three cosmetics they’ll get as Ultimate Perks. The second cosmetic will drop in the second month, and the third in the third month.

The first-party PS5 and PS4 lineup looks great, even if we likely will never get first-party games day-and-date on PS Plus a la Xbox Game Pass. I’m especially excited to see newer titles like Death Stranding Director’s Cut, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the list because it means that yes, while we won’t be getting big releases immediately on PS Plus, we might not have to wait too long for them to hit the subscription service. 
The third-party lineup isn’t nearly as exciting but it does include some bangers like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Control: Ultimate Edition, and Red Dead Redemption 2. I’m less worried about …</span>

“The Robocop Outfit includes the LEG-209 Back Bling, the leg of ED-209 that’s separately available as a Pickaxe,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “Get them both in the Robocop Bundle and use LEG-209 as a Pickaxe that can be a Back Bling and vice versa.

If you&#x27;re a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments. PC Gamer reports that a new mod allows Tarnished to group up with some of their favorite NPCs and bosses so that The Lands Between is a little easier and less lonely to navigate. 
SPOILERS FOR NPC &amp; BOSS NAMES/PHASES BELOW
Satoshi98 is the modder behind this cool pseudo-party system. The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it&#x27;s akin to Skyrim&#x27;s follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring&#x27;s exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others. You can purchase these followers from Miriel at the Church of Vows. 
Head here to see what else Satoshi98&#x27;s mod entails and be sure to read about why I think From Software&#x27;s Next Game Should Prioritize Coop.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a new superhero title, initially slated for a March 2022 release until it was delayed until the second half of the year. Firaxis, the team behind the classic strategy franchise, XCOM, is helming the project. Midnight Suns was our cover game last summer and looks to tell a darker story within the Marvel universe while also mixing Firaxis&#x27; turn-based strategy mechanics with deck building. According to Push Square, a Korean games listing revealed the Midnight Suns&#x27; rating, meaning a release date might be on the horizon.
Push Square posits that we might get more Midnight Suns news during this year&#x27;s Summer Games Fest. And since we&#x27;re coming up to the second half of 2022, this might not be misguided speculation. You can click here to see the game&#x27;s rating for yourself. Hopefully, this means we won&#x27;t be seeing another delay.
Marvel’s Midnight Suns chronicles the exploits of a powerful sorceress named Lilith, who unleashes an army of demons upon the world.  The Midnight Suns, a group of several fan-favorite heroes, including Wolverine, Blade, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, led by you, The Hunter, must join forces and thwart Lilith&#x27;s plans.

Sony just released a new look at its PS5, PS4, PS3, and classic games lineup this morning, with news that some Ubisoft titles like Assassins’ Creed Valhalla will be included. Today, Ubisoft revealed Ubisoft+ will come bundled with the upper tiers of PlayStation’s revamped PS Plus service. It will begin with 27 titles when the revamped PS Plus launches in different regions and will grow to 50 by the end of 2022.

                              <span>Back in March, Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 consoles next month. Today, the company has released a new look at the lineup of PS5, PS4, PS3, and “classic” titles that will come to the service. 
Many of these games are already available on the PS5-exclusive PlayStation Plus Collection, namely first-party titles such as The Last of Us Remastered, but many of these are new to Sony’s PS Plus service. Today’s unveiling includes a list of PS5 and PS4 games, PS3 games playable via streaming, and remastered PS4 games that Sony refers to as “classic” alongside original PlayStation and PlayStation Portable games.

                              <span>I am extremely bad at card games, despite the fact that meeting up and playing poker at a friend&#x27;s house was one of the main entertainments on offer when I was a teenager (because one guy had a full chip set, for some reason). I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that&#x27;ll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I&#x27;m very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

AestheticGamer, née Dusk Golem, posted the images to Twitter, claiming they were a &quot;Silent Hill leak&quot;, and that they&#x27;d received &quot;more than enough proof to believe&quot; their source wasn&#x27;t telling porkies.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by several cute and unexpectedly deadly animals, as well a place which is not a place of honor, a Bitcoin hellscape, and of course more grappling hook ultraviolence.

                              <span>A new Elden Ring survey has revealed a bunch of our favourite things about FromSoftware’s wildly popular action RPG - and it turns out everyone really loves the NPC Ranni the Witch. Conducted by Japanese gaming mag Famitsu and translated by FrontlineJP, the survey also reveals our favourite bosses, items, areas and loads more. In addition to Ranni, it also turns out players were very fond of the living jar Iron Fist Alexander, while their favourite enemy was the demigod Starscourge Radahn.

The site was relatively small but has a unique history, as it initially launched as a tracker exclusively for Reddit users. A near-catastrophic technical failure in 2017 hit the site hard. While the site returned, it never reached its old highs again and staffers lost their motivation along the way.

                              <span>One year ago, The Pirate Bay released its very own &#x27;crypto&#x27; token out of the blue. There was no official whitepaper for this soft launch, but the torrent site envisioned the &#x27;coin&#x27; being used to access VIP content or donate to uploaders. Thus far, nothing has come of it. People don&#x27;t seem interested in the &#x27;project&#x27; and the price continues to drop.

                              <span>Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure is in some ways the most grimdark Soulslike yet. It&#x27;s about a cute crab battling other crabs at the bottom of a colourful sea, sure, but the different shells and the weapons you and your enemies are wielding are made from trash dumping into that colourful sea by humans.

It&#x27;s still cute, though. There&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard published a post on their website about their &quot;Diversity Space Tool&quot;. Developed by subsidiary King, it&#x27;s a tool for rating video game characters along certain axes in order to rate their relative diversity. Several people then pointed out that sounded mildly dystopian.

Yesterday, Activison Blizzard responded, saying that the &quot;prototype is not being used in active game development&quot;, and was designed as an optional supplement to other work.

                              <span>Happy Eurovision day, everyone! Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year&#x27;s contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria&#x27;s pop goths and Latvia&#x27;s song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that&#x27;s the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We&#x27;re doing things differently this time as we&#x27;re discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we continue our season by analyzing 2017&#x27;s Pyre. 
Pyre was released on June 25, 2017. After Supergiant struggled to create Transistor, the team adopted a looser &quot;anything goes&quot; approach for Pyre. The game blends together disparate elements reflecting the team&#x27;s interests such as a high-fantasy setting, a large cast of engaging characters, a ritual in the form of a basketball/soccer-like competition, and Oregon Trail-inspired exploration. Tune in to find out how Supergiant concocted the game&#x27;s centerpiece &quot;sports&quot; game, its approach to crafting a larger branching narrative (including an ever-changing end credit song), and which members of the Nightwings we chose to liberate and the ones we abandoned in the Downside.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with video game consultant and former Game Informer editor Suriel Vazquez (@SurielVazquez) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Pyre!

                              <span>To unlock every character in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, you&#x27;ll need to play through all nine movies and perform specific tasks, but you can get a few by simply entering a code. TT Games and Warner Bros. Interactive provided Game Informer with several codes at launch. When you boot up the game, enter the pause screen, then access the option &quot;Enter Code.&quot;
The codes will add a variety of characters like Dengar and Emperor Palpatine. Getting these characters early is a big win, as they are a part of classes you&#x27;ll need to perform certain feats and don&#x27;t normally unlock until later in the game. Here are the codes:
Aayla Secura: KH7P320
Admiral Holdo: XV4WND9
C-3PO (Holiday): C3PHOHO
Chewbacca (Holiday): WOOKIEE
DARTH VADER (Holiday): WROSHYR
Dengar: OKV7TLR
D-O (Holiday): TIPYIPS
Emperor Palpatine: SIDIOUS
Gonk Droid (Holiday): LIFEDAY
Grand Moff Tarkin: 3FCPPVX
Mister Bones: BAC1CKP
Nute Gunray: WBFE4GO
Poe Dameron (Holiday): KORDOKU
Poggle The Lesser: Z55T8CQ
Ratts Tyerell: GR2VBXF
Razor Crest (Ship): ARVALA7
Resistance I-TS Transport (Ship): SHUTTLE
Shaak Ti: VT1LFNH
Shmi Skywalker: T9LM1QF
Snap Wexley: SKYSAGA
We&#x27;ll update this list as more character codes are discovered. Until then, have fun unlocking characters on your own, and may the Force be with you!</span>

                              <span>When I was a kid, I had a Luke Skywalker action figure with a lightsaber that slid out of his wrist. It was one of my prized possessions, even though the details were lacking. This version of Luke looked more like an elf from the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer claymation film than actor Mark Hamill. His lightsaber was also oddly yellow instead of blue – a detail I always thought was odd.
The point being, action figures have come a LONG way since then. Hot Toys&#x27; latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness action figure looks so realistic it could be in a wax museum. Benedict Cumberbatch&#x27;s facial detailing is spot on, and the 30 points of articulation allow for many of his spell-casting poses to be recreated. To make sure these spell motions look just like in the movie, Hot Toys includes over a dozen interchangeable hands with fingers pointing every which way. You&#x27;ll also find five mystic powers to go along with some of the hands to truly sell the effects of the spell.  
The figure is 31 centimeters in height and comes with a variety of accessories, like the Book of Vishanti, two sling rings, an amulet, handcuffs, mystic vipers, and so much more.
Hot Toys hasn&#x27;t given us a price yet, but it&#x27;s expected to ship in either the third or fourth quarter of 2023. You can find out more about this amazing figure at Hot Toys&#x27; official site. Check out images of this figure in action below:</span>

                              <span>Stop me if you&#x27;ve heard this before, but the Halo series has continuously been a roller coaster ride of good and bad, and few episodes encapsulate that as well as this week&#x27;s tale in &quot;Allegiance.&quot; Join us on The Game Informer Show as we discuss the eighth episode of the series, break down the most significant moments, and discuss the scene everyone is talking about.


Your regular hosts of Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are back again and definitely have thoughts on the return of Master Chief, Makee, and Dr. Halsey. After a week away on Madrigal with Kwan and Soren, the focus shifts back to Reach and what the UNSC is doing about finding The Covenant and Halo. While the militaristic arm of humanity panics over other planets getting glassed by their alien foes, John and Makee are spending time getting to know each other after their shared vision of the show&#x27;s namesake.
While the universe&#x27;s greatest Spartan and the Covenant spy fraternize in the park (and other places), Dr. Halsey continues to meddle in order to advance humanity in her image, threatening the people she&#x27;s trying to save in the process. Will the good doctor&#x27;s interference and the union between the main characters result in unity between the two warring factions or make the upcoming battle that much harder? You&#x27;ll just have to listen to this week&#x27;s show to find out.
What do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We&#x27;d also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.</span>

It&#x27;s impossible to create an exhaustive list of every term that falls in and out of common usage around the gaming landscape, but there are some words that we repeatedly see misunderstood or questioned.
Here are some of those most commonly used and misunderstood terms, and a shortform definition of what they mean and how they&#x27;re most commonly discussed. In addition, we&#x27;ve paired up several words that are often used either in conjunction with one another, or are commonly misused in context.

Lastly, Rocko of Rocko’s Modern Life fame is slated for the fall. 
The announcement trailer below largely focuses on Jenny, who can pummel opponents with rocket-powered fists, zap them with lasers, slice them up with buzzsaws, and utilize other gadgets. Unfortunately, we don’t get any gameplay footage of Hugh or Rocko, but those videos will likely arrive as we approach each character’s launch dates.
Each fighter is labeled as premium DLC, meaning they come at a price. You can grab Jenny, her Tremorton Joyride stage, and her alternate costume for $4.99. A Universe Pack containing all three characters, along with the new stages and costumes tied to them, goes for $11.99. 


Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl didn’t blow us away (here’s our review), but it&#x27;s a respectable platform fighter and it’s cool to see developer Ludosity continue to bolster the roster with fan-favorite characters. One has to wonder if these will be the only new faces to grace the game in 2022 given how spaced out they are, and what characters will be added in 2023, if any.

                              <span>Evil Dead: The Game has arrived, giving fans of Sam Raimi’s beloved horror series the chance to mow down Deadites as Ash and friends! Today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central, the Game Informer crew will rev up their chainsaws, load their shotguns, and battle the undead in what should be a groovy time. 
Evil Dead: The Game pits four players against one human-controlled Demon in an asymmetrical multiplayer adventure. The good guys include Ash and other characters across the Evil Dead mythos, who work together to eradicate hordes of supernatural enemies. The Demon player’s job is to throw every cursed abomination at their disposal to stop the other players dead in their tracks by any bloody means necessary.

                              <span>Arma fans may want to clear Tuesday, May 17, from their calendars. Developer Bohemia Interactive announced a livestream on that day focused on the future of the series.  Bohemia’s press release teases next to nothing of what to expect, only saying the presentation will feature an &quot;exciting reveal.&quot; Will it be Arma 4? You can find out by catching the stream on the Arma Twitch channel, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern.  
The last mainline entry was 2013’s Arma 3, a game Bohemia has consistently supported with numerous content updates over the past nine years. Its most recent expansion, Arma 3: Creator DLC: SOG - Prairie Fire, launched in 2021. The tactical shooter franchise has maintained a popular following, and its active mod scene helped spawn popular multiplayer offshoots such as DayZ and PUBG: Battlegrounds.

                              <span>April 2022 will go down as a historic month for Nintendo’s Switch console because it’s the month the hybrid console surpassed the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 4 in the U.S. 
This news comes by way of The NPD Group’s Mat Piscatella, who reports monthly U.S. sales numbers of video game hardware, software, accessories, and more. This month’s news includes an overall decline in consumer video game spending, down 8%, to $4.3 billion, compared to April of last year. Year-to-date 2022 spending is also 8% lower than the same period one year ago, down to $18.3 billion. However, it was still a great month for video game hardware – especially the Switch.

                              <span>Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

                              <span>The Pokémon Trading Card Game is back with its second expansion of 2022, and this time, despite the Sword &amp; Shield nomenclature on the box, I was most excited for the Pokémon that appeared in games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.
The Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don&#x27;t worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII&#x27;s main region.
However, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:

                              <span>The NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers has revealed its upcoming 2022 season football schedule in the best way possible and it’s a must-watch. 
Releasing a football schedule might sound boring on paper, and perhaps if you’re not the Chargers it is, but the Los Angeles-based team decided to do something we think every NFL team should do: release its football schedule as an anime opening, complete with a great track and some well-done animation that harkens back to anime favorites like One Piece, Attack On Titan, and much more. Check it out for yourself below!
Should we REALLY make our schedule release video an anime?

As you can see, the video begins with a nice logo treatment before revealing that the Chargers will face the Las Vegas Raiders in both teams’ first game of the 2022 season. And if you’re at all familiar with One Piece, you can see how the Chargers turned the Raiders into the One Piece team. 

The rest of the video contains a bunch of other great anime references so be sure to check it out and let us know which one is your favorite below! After that, read Game Informer’s Madden NFL 22 review.</span>

                              <span>If you’ve played Elden Ring, then you’re familiar with the strange occurrence that happens when you reach the main menu of the game and you’re somehow forced to sit on the screen for at least 30 seconds while listening to what can only be described as an extremely hype start to the day’s Elden Ring session (or is that just me?). 
It’s a great song – orchestral, epic, and an awesome way to begin the game each time you boot it up. However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. 


As you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!

                              <span>AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won&#x27;t need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

This month, we&#x27;ve shifted our game preservation gaze to 2009, so read on below to find out which games made the cut, and which have been cast off into the eternal games bin.

                              <span>While fads come and go, mech games continue to simmer pleasantly away without ever taking over or going away. The latest one I&#x27;ve finally made some time for is Ignited Steel Colon Mech Tactics, a turn-based tactical game with a light sprinkling of FTL.
Despite appearances, it&#x27;s quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren&#x27;t quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It&#x27;s a good time.

To answer that question, we&#x27;ve teamed up in this article like a Müller and its corner to mingle our thoughts in word form. Of course, if you&#x27;d rather hear us grumble at each other in glorious video form, you can watch that down below.

Pétursson is hardly the first person to profess an affection for Paul Verhoeven’s cult military satire. But he is one of the few with command of his own company of science fiction game developers. For well over half of Eve Online’s existence, he has led CCP in an effort to create the perfect spin-off shooter - stubbornly chasing the dream of a playable Starship Troopers, even as those brave young prototypes have been cut down by unimpressed players, one after the other.

                              <span>The Lego games I&#x27;m most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year&#x27;s extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, in that you&#x27;re exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it&#x27;s way more granular. You&#x27;re whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it&#x27;s like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it&#x27;s sort of surprising that you can&#x27;t reach through the screen and pick it up. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

                              <span>Hello, gentle listener. I&#x27;m afraid it has been a while since we went into the exclusion zone to find an episode or two of The Nate Files, our extra supporter-only podcast. This is entirely my fault; I was incautious while we were in there and accidentally refracted into an eel, and then Nate nearly ate that eel - it was a whole thing*, but I&#x27;m right as rain now. That&#x27;s a-moray! Thank you for sticking with us while we got that admin sorted out. We really do appreciate your support so we can make these podcasts and do other fun things (like pay for my de-sliming). We couldn&#x27;t do it without you!

                              <span>MiHoYo have announced their new action RPG follow-up to Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, with registration for its closed beta beginning today. This one veers away from Genshin’s more traditional fantasy world towards post-apocalyptic urban science-fantasy, set in the effortlessly cool city of New Eridu. MiHoYo say this is “the last shelter for urban civilization due to the calamity”. So far, so mysterious.

Overlord aims to offer more control over your empires, both to let you shape them in more specific ways and also to generate more anecdotes when it all goes wrong.

As always, the expansion also releasing alongside a new free patch with balance fixes and bux fixes for all.

They followed through by releasing 4X strategy game Dune: Spice Wars last month, and now it seems they&#x27;re ramping up development on a new open world survival game set in the Dune universe.

                              <span>There&#x27;s presumably less pressure to keep every scrap of information secret when the game you&#x27;re developing is a remake. EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake&#x27;s audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game&#x27;s art, they&#x27;ve announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

                              <span>You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

This is a very broad topic for discussion, so that means I also get to say &#x27;ludonarrative dissonance&#x27; (we also describe &#x27;ludonarrative harmony&#x27; as its opposite). Please don&#x27;t let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko!&quot; tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

                              <span>Bethesda have just announced they&#x27;re delaying Starfield and Redfall until the first half of 2023. Bethesda&#x27;s RPG space epic was originally due to arrive on November 11th 2022, with Arkane Austin&#x27;s first-person vampire survival game Redfall arriving sometime this summer, but now both titles have been shifted back to an unknown time between Janauary and June next year.

                              <span>Leave the doormat outside long enough in Age Of Darkness: Final Stand and you might not live to see the morning. If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

                              <span>John Romero, legendary developer and co-creator of PC classics Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein, has announced he’s writing an autobiography entitled &#x27;Doom Guy – Life In First-Person&#x27;. The book isn&#x27;t due to be published until early next year, but does this mean the Doom movie from 2005 starring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is technically Romero’s biopic? Did The Rock not want to wear a wig? I’m very confused.

While this is arguably a poor use of my time, I enjoy the process—and technically it is productive. But perhaps you, reader dear, might enjoy hearing about these small things, or at least find them interesting/weird. So let&#x27;s talk about the work which went into producing one (1) screenshot and 43 seconds of video for last week&#x27;s post about the Morrowind modder who added the family cat because their kids were afraid of mudcrabs.

This time, the big new feature is the ability to create per-game performance profiles, which let you pick and choose from the Deck’s toy chest of power and battery-saving settings and apply your tailored configuration to a specific game at a time. You can then switch between games without having to manually re-adjust those settings every time you play something different.

In addition to making it easier for copyright holders to disable access to identified infringing content at the ISP level, similar powers will enable urgent and precautionary blocking even before an infringement takes place.

I feel I should&#x27;ve defined drawbacks more narrowly but there&#x27;ll be chaos if introduce undosies. Onwards! Next, I present a choice between two oft-disliked things.

                              <span>Loot River, the pixely roguelike with a bit of Souls and a bit of Tetris, is all about making multiple attempts to navigate weird dungeons made of moving platforms, before dying and starting again. It&#x27;s one of those games that&#x27;s perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that&#x27;s going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn&#x27;t realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they&#x27;ve already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

Phew. We already knew the event was going to kick off on June 9th, but Keighley has now revealed that the bulk of the announcements will be done and dusted by Sunday June 12th. And breathe...

                              <span>Just a few days ago, the expected release of Songs Of Conquest turned into the expected release of Songs Of Conquest into early access. There are times when such a pivot might dramatically change the angle you&#x27;d need to review a game from.


This isn&#x27;t really one of those times, because I think I&#x27;d be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to &quot;figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize&quot; could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve not played Call Of Duty: Warzone in yonks. It used to take up practically all of my time, and now it&#x27;s sat there neglected on my PC for the better part of a year or so. Even with King Kong and Godzilla arriving in the game today, I&#x27;m still playing Fortnite over it, which says it all, really.
Why did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I&#x27;d become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it&#x27;s changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there&#x27;s been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.

MiHoYo announced the delay on Twitter last week due to “project progress”, but promised to issue Travelers with complimentary goodies every week until the launch of update 2.7. They don’t clarify when that update will be though. More info is in the full statement on MiHoYo’s site.

                              <span>Source Of Madness is a side-scrolling roguelite set in a Lovecraftian setting populated by twisted Bamzooki. And it&#x27;s a world where everything been procedurally generated with the help of machine learning. This makes for some fabulous, gloomy aesthetics and tormented beasts, but also means it&#x27;s a messy roguelite with a loop that leads more to frustration than anything else.

It&#x27;s an arcade shoot &#x27;em up where you gather random weapons and upgrades (and so many gems) across a run but attacking is kinda out of your hands. I&#x27;m not much of a shmupper but Gunlocked has started scratching that Vampire Survivors itch for me, and it&#x27;s less than £3.

As Kim Dotcom vows to keep fighting extradition, he says that he too should be given the same right. Of course, nothing is straightforward.

This will apply retroactively to major movie studios with Disney being a prime target. The plan appears to be an indirect attempt to punish Disney for its politics, including the opposition to Florida&#x27;s “Don’t Say Gay” law.

                              <span>A man who was wrongfully accused of pirating several adult films has finally recouped $108k in fees and costs from copyright holder Malibu Media. After the company failed to pay the full amount voluntarily, the defense had to hire a collection attorney to get the money indirectly through Malibu&#x27;s payment processors.

                              <span>The antitrust lawsuit against Valve can continue, a US judge has ruled. Valve had filed a motion for the case to be dismissed, but the latest ruling states that game publishers &quot;plausibly allege&quot; that they &quot;suffer price and non-price injury&quot; from Valve&#x27;s conduct related to Steam. In particular, the suit alleges that Valve use &quot;most favoured nation&quot; policies to prevent competition based on price.

EA Sports are ditching the FIFA licence from their ball kicking series, with the game due for release later this year the last to bear to use the FIFA name. From 2023 onwards, the series will be called EA Sports FC.

That&#x27;s a fair bit, so we were excited to see a refurbished option for $140 at Best Buy. That&#x27;s considerably cheaper than any other 2TB NVMe SSD on the market, and user reviews on Best Buy paint a rosy picture of barely-used drives whose condition can easily be checked.

                              <span>Shirley Curry, aka the wonderful Skyrim Grandma, doesn&#x27;t mess about. When asked by a fan (who we&#x27;ve since identified as YouTuber damarcodude) during her recent PAX East 2022 Q&amp;A panel about what she&#x27;d like to say to Elder Scrolls head honcho Todd Howard if he were here in person, she had one answer: &quot;Hurry up and finish The Elder Scrolls 6.&quot; All right, she technically would have said hello first, but the point still stands.

                              <span>One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma&#x27;s panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda&#x27;s enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let&#x27;s Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that&#x27;s &quot;weird and creepy&quot;, and has recently been looking for something new to play. &quot;I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,&quot; she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. 
It was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here&#x27;s a written transcript of the entire audience Q&amp;A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure.

                              <span>AMD are looking to wring the last few GPUs out of their RDNA 2 architecture, ahead of the RDNA 3-powered Radeon 7000 series launching later this year. They’ve just announced the Radeon RX 6650 XT, the Radeon RX 6750 XT and the Radeon RX 6950 XT: slightly faster, but more expensive and power-hungry refreshes of the RX 6600 XT, RX 6700 XT and RX 6900 XT models. These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.

They know an important message is to follow, and that everybody in voice chat needs to hear it. Often, when Michael Pusateri is in a work meeting at NBCUniversal that’s going sideways, the same comms command enters his head. &quot;Check, check. Shut up, everyone.&quot;


“They’re all talking over each other and nothing’s getting done and it’s spinning into chaos,” says Pusateri, a VP for Creative Technology who goes by Dunk Dinkle in-game. “Why can’t these people who are being paid so much money behave as well as these people who get paid nothing?”

                              <span>I&#x27;m not really a superhero guy, but I&#x27;d say Batman is my favourite of the bunch. He&#x27;s gruff and edgy and wears a cape well. He&#x27;s also dead – in open-world action RPG Gotham Knights, at least. &quot;Gah&quot;, was my initial reaction, but that&#x27;s changed to &quot;Oh well&quot; having seen 13 minutes of new gameplay footage showing Night Wing and Red Hood stick it to some thugs. What about four-player co-op? Nope, sorry; it&#x27;s confirmed only to be two-player, as that&#x27;s what Batman would&#x27;ve wanted.

                              <span>Charity speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) returns on June 26th, with its first Elden Ring runs on PC on July 3rd. Tunic and Halo Infinite’s campaign are also marking their first appearances. Runners haven’t gathered in person since Awesome Games Done Quick 2020, but are once again back in riverside Bloomington, Minnesota for SGDQ 2022. Runs are in aid of Doctors Without Borders this time around – Games Done Quick’s events have raised more than $2.8 million (£2 million) for that charity to date.
