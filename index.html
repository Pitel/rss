                              <span>The Linux kernel &quot;FORCE_NR_CPUS&quot; Kconfig option has been around a few years to force the number of CPU cores the kernel expects in order to allow for better compiler optimizations. When building a kernel targeted for a specific device/platform with a given number of CPU cores, the compiler can optimize CPU mask routines and shrink the size of the resulting kernel image rather than having to accommodate up to a dynamic upper-limit for the number of CPU cores to be found at boot time. Linus Torvalds himself has turned to demoting this CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS option further to avoid confusion...</span>

                              <span>Metal Slug Attack actually began as a mobile tower defense game for iOS and Android devices many years ago, but today, as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Summer Direct presentation, it was revealed the game is getting &quot;reloaded&quot; for just about every platform. Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

Should you name the baby Sirius or Orion in Warframe?


After being spared by the overwhelming barrage of shots, the Stalker escapes, with his child in his arms. Not yet named, you, the player, are now tasked with naming the child. So, do you name them Sirius or Orion?

That Sword can be improved upon with its Exotic Catalyst, but you&#x27;ll need to work to get it. 


An Exotic Catalyst acts as an additional ability or Trait for Exotic weapons in Destiny 2. They must first be unlocked; then, quests or requirements must be met to help them reach their true potential. An Exotic weapon as powerful as Ergo Sum with a Catalyst is something to be proud of and something for enemies to fear. It&#x27;ll make light work of even Salvation&#x27;s Edge in the right hands.

                              <span>Since XDefiant first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. 


Ubisoft confirmed that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience.  


Team Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as Modern Warfare 3, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. 




XDefiant features two different types of maps. Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. 


As for other highly requested game modes, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin previously confirmed on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update.

This console is a special edition of the Nintendo Switch Lite, possibly the best ever made. In the past, we&#x27;ve had slight variations on the design, the most recent of which was for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but only the Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and Sword and Shield Editions really went anywhere with their designs. The Hyrule Edition kicks things up a notch with a striking look for what looks to be an amazing game.

                              <span>Ubisoft expedited XDefiant&#x27;s weapon leveling process by decreasing the XP requirement. However, to maintain player engagement, the development team made the weapon mastery unlock process harder, dividing players. 


As part of the June 18 XDefiant update, Ubisoft lowered the XP needed to level up a primary weapon from 3.500 to 3,000 and a secondary weapon from 1,500 to 1,000. As a counterbalance, the Bronze camo level was increased from 50 to 100, Silver from 75 to 150, and Gold from 100 to 200. 


Previously, XDefiant developer Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price explained that one kill equals 100 XP, meaning it took around 35 kills per level. Considering that there are 18 primary weapons and all attachments aren&#x27;t unlocked until level 43, that&#x27;s a steep undertaking for a player of any skill level. Mul…</span>

                              <span>Less than a day after publisher Paradox Interactive canceled Life by You, the company announced that the game&#x27;s developer Paradox Tectonic is shutting down.


The news was delivered earlier this morning by the publisher. Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, called the move, which affects 24 people, &quot;difficult and drastic,&quot; and shutting down the studio was a &quot;tough decision.&quot; 


&quot;This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,&quot; Wester said. &quot;Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.&quot;

Paradox Tectonic is shutting down after Life by You cancellation


Paradox announced the cancellation of Life by You yesterday. In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: &quot;A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release.&quot; The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down The Lamplighters League for approximately $23 million a week after the game launched. 


It has been troubling all around. Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s shuttering feels like another stone in the road for an industry that has already experienced a lot of job loss in 2024 — and we&#x27;re only halfway through the year. Just yesterday, before the news of the Life by You cancellation, Embracer Group announced the closure of Alone in the Dark (2024) developer Pieces Interactive. Microsoft closed down the Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin (along with Alpha Dog Games) ahead of its big June showcase. Needless to say, the move dampened the excitement before the show.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re considering delving into the Iain M. Banks&#x27; Culture series, you would be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work and deciding what order to read them in. Thankfully, it is mostly down to personal preference, so here is mine.


What order to read the Culture series


When I read these books the first time, I picked them up more or less in order of publication and read them this way. Now, I would like to prelude this piece by saying that it is perfectly fine. But, looking back, I may have done it a little differently. There are good works and great works, and some curious ones, too. This means that it is possible to gain a little more from your first time reading the Culture series if you choose a different order.

                              <span>Modern Horizons is the next major Forza Horizon 5 festival, and the Jurassic Park jeep is one of the iconic vehicles that&#x27;s now available in the game. 


Playground Games has nicknamed this festival&#x27;s vehicles as the &quot;Decade&#x27;s Greatest Cars&quot; and there can be few disagreements with that claim. In fact, the Universal car pack is one of the my favorite paid DLCs launched by Playground Games. However, there&#x27;s plenty in it for those who might not be wanting to spend real-life money on the car pack. There&#x27;s a new car to be unlocked every week while the festival is live. 


How to get the Jurassic Park car in Forza Horizon 5


The new cars set to be added as part of Modern Horizons can be broken down into two broad groups:



Premium DLC pack cars

However, if you&#x27;re still on the hunt for the new Jade Shadows weapon, here&#x27;s how to get the Harmony in Warframe, along with my best tips for farming. 


How to get the Harmony scythe in Warframe&#x27;s Jade Shadows update


To get the Harmony in Warframe, you have to first complete the new Jade Shadows quest to unlock the Ascension game mode, Brutus, on Uranus. From here, just complete the mode to farm up Vestigial Motes.


You will need to earn 300 Motes so you can then purchase this weapon from Ordis on the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It’ll ta…</span>

However, the Foundation books move forward and backward in time, not to mention spanning galaxies, so knowing which order to read them can be a little confusing.


The right order to read The Foundation Series


Now, like any list, this is subjective, and there are many differing opinions on which is the correct order to tackle the Foundation series. However, I have read them all, some of them a few times, and I consider myself familiar with the universe. This is how I think you should go about it, combined with my further rabbit hole of research.

                              <span>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and his team at Mistwalker, including legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, combined forces once again to unleash Fantasian on Apple Arcade in two parts in 2021. Naturally, that means the audience was inherently limited, but now that it&#x27;s finally expanding to other platforms, Sakaguchi shared some thoughts. 


In a statement on Fantasian&#x27;s official English social accounts, Sakaguchi started off by saying that he always wanted Fantasian to be an &quot;especially long-standing title,&quot; and he cites that longevity as one of the strengths of digital games. &quot;I developed Fantasian thinking that it could become my final work before retiring, so it has a special place in my heart,&quot; he continued. 




Sakaguchi added that being able to rebuild Fantasian at Square Enix and offer it to a wider audience is &quot;truly a blessing.&quot; Beyond the exploration and turn-based combat, a lot of the appeal of Fantasian comes down to its beautifully bespoke nature. The backgrounds consist of hand-crafted dioramas, over 150 of which were scanned into the game. Sakaguchi closed out his statement with a nod to all this loving, laborious work, saying, &quot;This title is an amalgamation of the souls of the diorama craftsmen, Uematsu compositions, and of course, the game developers.&quot;

Square Enix is helping Sakaguchi and his team revitalize the RPG as Fantasian Neo Dimension. The new version keeps the story and gameplay intact while adding in some additional features, including English and Japanese voiceovers and more difficulty options. It&#x27;s currently set for a 2024 release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


As great as exclusives can be, it&#x27;s even better when more people have a chance to enjoy a game you&#x27;ve worked so hard on over the years. Here&#x27;s hoping this is far from Sakaguchi&#x27;s final fantasy.

                              <span>A new patch is live, fixing some of the bugs brought by the big patch last week. But it doesn&#x27;t address everything. The Helldivers 2 developer has responded to the patrol rate concerns with no promises of a fix, and Superior Packing Methodology is still not working as intended. 


That&#x27;s not to say the new Helldivers 2 update is weak by any metric, as shown by today&#x27;s patch notes. Patch 1.000.402 fixes bugs, addresses crashes, and adds some nice enhancements that should be welcomed by the community at large. One of my favorite changes? Calling in a Hellbomb should now cause it to face you instead of away. At last, no longer will divers need to try and squeeze themselves between a building and a bomb that has the power to turn everything around it to ash. That&#x27;s a good thing.

                              <span>Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, who portrayed Kingpin/Wilson Fisk in Netflix’s Daredevil and Marvel Studios&#x27; Echo, has shared his thoughts on the complexity of the situation between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. D&#x27;Onofrio feels unsure at the moment about how and where the future of Wilson Fisk will be and explains that it is due to the interchanging rights of the characters between Sony and Marvel.


The actor shared his thoughts on the situation amid rumors of his involvement in the upcoming Disney+ show called Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Charlie Cox is already confirmed to be reprising his role as Daredevil in the animated series.




“I&#x27;m going to transparently say this: You know the whole Marvel-Sony thing, right? So there are characters — Marvel characters invented by Marvel, written by Marvel — that are caught in between Marvel and Sony,” explained the actor at the Fan Expo Boston, as reported by Comic Book.


Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio also added that this setup between the two companies is why “it takes a long time for them to figure out who is doing what.” As for where Kingpin can show up, he said that he never really knows where it may happen.


“My character is in that kind of situation, unlike Charlie&#x27;s [Charlie Cox]. So I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s part of the deal when it comes to playing Kingpin,” said Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio.


While Kingpin has been introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through Hawkeye and Echo, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio’s Kingpin will be in the spotlight once again in the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again show. Daredevil: Born Again is slated for a release in March 2025.

How to get the Cantare in Warframe


To get the Cantare, you need to farm the new Brutus mission on Uranus. Here, you’ll earn Vestigial Motes, and trade with Ordis on the Larunda Relay on Mercury. You need to accumulate 300 units to buy Jade’s signature throwing knives.


It will take some time until you have enough to buy it. However, with each run of this mission, you have a 5% chance of getting the b…</span>

                              <span>In the advent of the new Jade Shadows update, the Evensong is the ‘light’ version of the Dread in Warframe you can score now. It’ll definitely serve more as a utility weapon, but it&#x27;s still one for bow lovers to keep in their arsenal. 


If you’re looking to get your hands on it, then here&#x27;s everything you need to know to get the Evensong in Warframe&#x27;s new Jade Shadows update. 


How to get the Evensong in Warframe


To get the Evensong in Warframe, you have to farm the new Brutus Ascension mission on Uranus. For now, it’s called Operation: Belly of the Beast. Once the event concludes, it’ll go back to just being Brutus. 


In any case, you have to farm Vestigial Motes from this mission so you can then trade them to Ordis. The Evensong costs 300 Motes, so it’ll take a lot until you can amass enough to purchase it.


However, while playing the new Ascension mission, you do run a slight chance of getting the Evensong in the process. Jade’s signature bow has a 5% chance to drop in this mission, both on the normal and Steel Path modes.


Every new item from the Jade Shadows update has a 5% chance to drop here. Though, with everything having the same probability of dropping, you also may run into multiple drops of the same weapon.

Best way to farm the Evensong in Warframe


The best way to farm the Evensong in Warframe is to keep playing the Brutus node on Steel Path until you have gained 300 Vestigial Motes. Enemy drops are better at the cost of a harder difficulty, but it pays off. 


Also, reaching 300 specifically is important because, in the time it takes to get those 300 Motes, you may have already snagged a few pieces of the Jade Warframe, the other weapons, or the Evensong. With how many other ways you can get Jade, you can prioritize the motes just for the weapons and Arcanes.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has revealed that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will receive a Fallout Bundle later this week and that a crossover event will see players earn Fallout-themed cosmetics and additional XP as they battle to save the world in style. 


The Call of Duty X Fallout Bundle will drop in Call of Duty: MW3 this week on Thursday, June 20, 2024. It adds more than 15 new items to the game, all based on the Fallout franchise. I don&#x27;t know about you, but it takes a lot for a game to sell me on cosmetics, and having those cosmetics themed around one of my favorite universes is a great way to convince me to spend money.

After director and producer Naoki Yoshida explained how server congestion shouldn’t be too much of an issue this time around, something which I find difficult to believe, there may be some hope on the horizon. However, if things go as sideways as they did during Endwalker’s release, there’s some advice direct from the FFXIV team. 


Login queues happen when a world is simply too full to accommodate all of the players who are trying to log in at once. As such, Final Fantasy XIV has implemented countermeasures to try and lessen the pain for Version 7.0. From…</span>

I found it eventually. I don’t remember how, but I’m glad I did because it gave me a taste of what I’ve been looking forward to. A big taste. It pushed my chin back and made sure I had no choice but to guzzle it all down. I had other things to do that evening, but they got shunted aside for three hours of Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop. I don’t regret it.

                              <span>After weeks of speculation, Activision finally confirmed a Fallout collaboration event in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. Here is everything you need to know about adding the operator bundle to your collection. 


So far, in Season 4, MW3 and Warzone have already done an ambitious crossover event with Mobile Suit Gundam, which featured several different operator bundles and a limited-time game mode. In addition, Activision brought back The Boys operator bundles, which include tracer packs from the satirical hero television series.  


In what&#x27;s set to be another outside-the-box event, Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone are set to introduce a Fallout crossover.

Based on previous crossovers, the Fallout bundle will most likely cost 2,400 CoD points, equivalent to $19.99.


Fallout Vault Dweller tracer pack release date


The Fallout bundle will be available to purchase on June 20. On that same date, the Vault Dwellers event goes live and runs through June 26. Players who use any of the Vault Dwellers operator skins during the event get an additional XP boost. In addition, the event features rewards such as the “New California Republic” Large Decal, “Nuka-Cola Caps” Emblem, “Slocum’s Joe” Sticker, “Nuka-Cola” Charm, and the “Nuka-Cola Quantum” Weapon Camo.

In any case, with her being out now, here’s how you can get her in the game.


How to get Jade in Warframe


To get Jade in Warframe, you must first complete the new Jade Shadows quest. It’ll take roughly between 30 to 40 minutes. For spoiler reasons, we will not go into how to complete it, but it’s rather straightforward and narrative-driven.


At the end of the quest, you will receive the blueprint for Jade. The rest of her components are in the new Ascension mode, Brutus, on Uranus. Each part has a 5% chance to drop, so it may take a while until you finally get them all.

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel’s release date for Japan has been announced. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, announced ahead of the Nintendo Direct that the movie will be released on April 26, 2026 in Japan.


The announcement came via a Twitter/X post where Miyamoto added, “We are working with the Illumination team to make it a fun movie, so please continue to look forward to it.”




This confirms that the Mario sequel will actually be released in Japan after its release in the US and other regions. Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri revealed back in March that the sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be released on April 3, 2026, in the US and other select regions.


It may not come as a surprise, given that The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released first in the US on April 5, 2023, before releasing in Japan on April 28, 2024.


While plot details are still anyone’s guess, Miyamoto had said back in March that the team is “thinking about broadening Mario&#x27;s world further, and it&#x27;ll have a bright and fun story.”


The Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel will be directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, and the script will be written by Matthew Fogel. The movie will be co-produced by Melendandri and Miyamoto. Universal Pictures will be distributing the movie globally.


Nintendo and Illumination’s Mario movie was a blockbuster hit as it grossed $1.36 billion at the global box office, made a $559 million profit, and became the most successful video game movie adaptation of all time.

                              <span>In a recent PC Gamer interview done while promoting Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow  Of The Erdtree DLC, director Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked about his thoughts on the massive wave of layoffs and studio closures which has been affecting the video games industry lately.


The situation is extremely dire, as even critical acclaim and a fair degree of commercial success won&#x27;t guarantee the survival of your job or company — even if it&#x27;s in the hands of multibillion dollar companies like Microsoft and Embracer Group.

Miyazaki assured fans of the Souls series that he&#x27;ll do whatever it takes to prevent layoffs from happening at From, stating that &quot;at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that&#x27;s something I would not let happen. So hopefully our players and our…</span>

                              <span>Destiny 2 has some of the best-named error codes around. While all of them will prevent you from playing, their names can at least make you laugh through the pain. One of the strangest ones I&#x27;ve ever encountered is the Destiny 2 Chicken error code.


The Chicken error code in Destiny 2 is bizarre because the reasoning behind it doesn&#x27;t seem to line up with when players experience it. I&#x27;ve found this firsthand because the error is, broadly speaking, linked to your connection to the internet. However, I only saw it when my connection was fine, which leads me to believe it might be a bit of a catch-all for various problems around updates.

                              <span>The EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC is the latest addition to Ultimate Team, and the Austrian wingback now has a new special item. 


EA Sports has introduced Posch&#x27;s promo card as part of a special challenge, which will be great news for the community. As long as you complete all the tasks (there&#x27;s just one) before the expiry of the SBC, the new card will be added to your Ultimate Team inventory. 


EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC tasks


There might be just one task, but it has certain conditions. These conditions must be satisfied during squad submission in order to earn the Make Your Mark card.


Task 1 - Stefan Posch



Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM


Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW


Min. Team Rating: 84



Only use a TOTS item to complete this challenge if you have a duplicate card that can be used elsewhere. 


EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC cheapest solutions


The EA FC 24 Stefan Posch Make Your Mark SBC has only one task, so it won&#x27;t cost too much to complete. Nevertheless, there are plenty of great SBCs like Alejandro Garnacho Make Your Mark to finish in Ultimate Team, so save as much in-game resources as possible. 


Task 1 - Stefan Posch



Thiago Alcantara 84


Stanislav Lobotka 84


Memphis Depay 84


Thomas Muller 84


Ismael Bennacer 84


Casey Stanway 84


Serge Gnabry 84


Griedge Mbock 84


Any 84-rated TOTS item


Luis Alberto 84


Franco Acerbi 83



The 93-rated RB item, which can also play as a CB and RWB, has the Anticipate+ and Intercept+ playstyles. This is a must complete for all beginners due to the available playstyles. Posch is also a starter for Austria, and the card might become an absolute bargain with upgrades. 


If you already have the extra fodder, this SBC could be well worth the fodder.

That noise is coming from Muir, another member of the rig&#x27;s crew who has been tragically mutated by whatever the drill crew ran into, and he&#x27;s lonely. 


Muir is a towering creature who patrols a large area in search of any surviving crew so he can absorb them into his mass. When you encounter him, he quickly grabs Dobbie before you find Innes, another survivor who tells you where to go. The only way forward is around Muir, so you&#x27;re going to have to get back to sneaking around and throwing objects to distract him from where you&#x27;re hiding.

                              <span>It wouldn&#x27;t be a new Warframe update if there weren&#x27;t a handful of new materials for you to collect. Duviri Paradox is the best example of a recent update that introduced a lot of materials, but each update tends to include a couple. The release of Jade Shadows is no different, and how you can use them can be a little confusing. Here&#x27;s what Vestigial and Volatile Motes are in Warframe.


How to get and use Vestigial and Volatile Motes in Warframe


Vestigial and Volatile Motes are acquired from the new Ascension game mode, accessible through the node Brutus, Uranus. During the mission, you&#x27;ll fight various enemies that will occasionally drop Vestigial or Volatile Motes, which can then be picked up. These come in at a few each run but typically give you more Vestigial Motes than Volatile.

These need to be taken to the Larunda Relay orbiting Mercury. Once there, you want to head to Ordis, who&#x27;s found in the Mission Control room on the right side of the relay. Alternatively, you can use the Fast Travel option in the Pause Menu to go straight to Ordis. Here, you&#x27;re able to access several shops. The Release Vestigial Motes shop lets you access Jade&#x27;s component blueprints alongside other useful items such as Arcanes. Other shops let you spend your Volatile Motes on other assorted items, including several cosmetics.

Be mindful that Volatile Motes are only available as part of the Operation: Belly of the Beast event that launched with the Jade Shadows update. Once the Operation disappears, only Vestigial Motes will be earnable. If you want some of the cosmetics in Ordis&#x27; shop, you&#x27;ll need to move fast.

                              <span>While not every Warframe update includes one, the updates that include new cinematic quests tend to be the most interesting ones. Between updates like The New War, Whispers in the Walls, and now Jade Shadows stick out more when you need to deal with story tidbits and cool setpieces instead of a new mission type to farm. Here&#x27;s how to access the latest main story quest for Warframe, known aptly as Jade Shadows.


How to play the Jade Shadows main quest in Warframe


Image via Destructoid.


The Jade Shadows quest becomes accessible after completing the New War main quest. This will require a lot of other quests to be completed beforehand, mostly centered around the main story. If you&#x27;re only partway through, you should focus on that instead of concerning yourself with most of the new update. However, those who have completed The New War can access the quest through the kiosk on the left of the Orbiter&#x27;s cockpit. Find the Jade Shadows quest in the menu, click on it, and select Begin in the bottom right.


If you are going to jump into the quest, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The mission is 30-40 minutes long depending on how quickly you tend to speed through content. You also won&#x27;t be able to access the rest of the game until the mission is complete, so you should get anything else you want done taken care of now.


Upon completion, you&#x27;ll get a handful of nice cosmetics along with the Jade main blueprint, granting you access to her provided you have her parts already. If you don&#x27;t, they can be acquired through the new Ascension game mode on the node Brutus, Uranus.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

Ace Attorney Investigations Collection comprises two games: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit. Neither game has been on PC before, and the latter has never been released outside of Japan.

                              <span>Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. &quot;Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he&#x27;s already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,&quot; notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. &quot;So he&#x27;s kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.&quot;

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn&#x27;t realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It&#x27;s about co-ordinating all your pieces so they&#x27;ll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don&#x27;t organise its parts. It is… a lot. It&#x27;s too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the &quot;themes or core elements&quot; of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a &quot;short-term way&quot;, by the experience of having a daughter.

                              <span>I&#x27;d been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, &quot;It&#x27;s hefty, but I think that&#x27;s probably pushing it&quot;.
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game&#x27;s Lands Between, but it&#x27;s knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring&#x27;s finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest 2024 has formally ended, we&#x27;ve spent a couple of weeks gorging upon demos of all stripes, from oil spill clean-up to dancefloor kendo, and now comes the all-important process of deciding which of those demos Won. Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn&#x27;t that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there&#x27;s a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

I normally wouldn’t let such an opaque stub of a description survive outside of a quick Trello reminder to write something better later, but I’m currently finding it fulfilling enough just to gaze upon that title and consider the fully formed art object that may soon emerge from its tantalising promises. Ok, so the visual component helps too. Orientate yourself by means of the trailer below, and let’s dig into this brazen nose-hooker of a head turner of a game that does exist, about another game that doesn’t.

With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. &quot;Habbo Hotel is back!&quot; is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

                              <span>Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the &quot;same&quot; money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I&#x27;d save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money&#x27;s worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I&#x27;d eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

How are all of the RPG fans doing after that Nintendo Direct, hey? One of the highlights of the show was Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, which made its long-awaited return after years of silence. We got music, a new trailer, and a release date of 14th November.
We also know some new features are coming to the game. Nintendo Life had the opportunity to go hands-on with the remake, and we were told by Square Enix that the job system will be &quot;modernised&quot;. We weren&#x27;t told what that meant exactly, but today&#x27;s trailer — and the newly-revealed Collector&#x27;s Edition — may provide a few hints.

“One World, Connecting Smiles.” That’s the tagline Sanrio, the company responsible for creating Hello Kitty, established back in 2021. Its brand is all about &#x27;Minna Nakayoku&#x27;, which means &#x27;all of us friends&#x27; or &#x27;Getting Along Together&#x27;. Unity, friendship, and love encompass the world of Sanrio, and it’s worked. For me, Hello Kitty has always been that unifying figure – an icon, kind of like a cuter Barbie, who is capable of anything but always puts her friends first. I had Hello Kitty Dream World figures, where the eponymous cat had a mushroom house, a pineapple juice bar (complete with a pineapple-costumed figure), and even a dolphin yacht. There was also a bee costume figure with detachable bee wings. What’s not to love?
Hello Kitty is one of the biggest brands in the world (for context, Hello Kitty grossed more merch money than Frozen, Batman, and Sesame Street in 2018). So it might be a surprise that she’s never really had a successful video game, despite starring in many, dating all the way back to the Famicom. That is, until 2023’s Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Well, well, that was a packed one, wasn&#x27;t it?
We&#x27;ve gotta be honest, expectations were sensibly low around these parts. For every wild card dream we had of a new Mario &amp; Luigi or that 2D Zelda we&#x27;ve been hoping Grezzo would make as a follow-up to Link&#x27;s Awakening, there was a wise voice in our ear warning us to be cautious and realistic. Switch launched back in 2017 and Nintendo has said there&#x27;s a new hardware announcement coming in a matter of months — surely all the big-name games are getting banked for the new system&#x27;s launch, right?

After launching on Steam last May and landing an ESRB rating last month, Red Hook Studios&#x27; spooky roguelike Darkest Dungeon II is finally making its way onto Switch on 15th July.
This one will see you embarking on a journey through a decaying wasteland in the hope of preventing the apocalypse — no pressure there then, eh? You&#x27;ll be building a party and working through five different &#x27;Confessions&#x27;, each with its own challenges and bosses.

Appearing briefly at the end of today&#x27;s announcement for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo revealed an all-new &#x27;Hyrule Edition&#x27; Switch Lite console which will be launching alongside the game on 26th September 2024.
This might just be the most eye-catching design of all the special edition Switch Lites. The &#x27;Hyrule Edition&#x27; console brandishes a gorgeous gold casing reminiscent of that sweet GBA SP model or Link Between Worlds 3DS XL, with the Hylian crest proudly displayed on its underside.

Well, the June 2024 Nintendo Direct has been broadcast. Nintendo warned us that there was definitely a Summer Direct coming (as is typical), and the 40-minute presentation was packed with Switch announcements for games coming in the second half of 2024, plus a select few for 2025. Metroid Prime 4 news, finally!
No mention of &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; (again, something Nintendo flagged beforehand), but there&#x27;s still plenty on the horizon for Switch as the console cruises through its eighth year.

In what might be the biggest surprise of the latest Nintendo Direct, the firm revealed The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a new &#x27;classic&#x27; style Zelda game in which you take on the role of the titular princess herself after Link disappears.
Utilising the art style from the Link&#x27;s Awakening Switch remake, Echoes of Wisdom looks stunning, so to highlight this further, we&#x27;ve presented a whole bunch of screenshots from the game right here for you to peruse at your leisure.

Originally released on iOS and Android in 2016 (with the servers closing down in January 2023), this &#x27;Reloaded&#x27; version promises to bring all of the action-shooter action that you would expect from the Metal Slug series to a new, tower defence format.

You&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was a co-production between Nintendo and Square Enix, what with the plethora of reveals from both companies. And Square Enix&#x27;s final announcement from today&#x27;s Direct was a surprise — a full remake of SNES RPG Romancing SaGa 2, which comes to Switch on 24th October 2024.
Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven brings the 1993 classic into full 3D, but it goes beyond just a simple visual update. Kenji Ito&#x27;s iconic soundtrack has been fully rearranged by the man himself (though the original tracks are also available). There will also be voice acting, both in English and Japanese, tweaks to the battle system, and an updated &#x27;timeline&#x27; system.

Well folks, the wait is over. More than seven years since its initial announcement, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has been fully revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct, and it looks incredible.
The trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal too much, but we&#x27;ve got confirmation that many of Samus&#x27; core abilities from the original trilogy return, including the morph ball, missiles, charge beam, scanning, and the lock-on/strafe mechanic. We also got a glimpse at Sylux, the illusive antagonist who we briefly saw in Metroid Prime: Federation Force, along with a bunch of Space Pirates and Metroids.

Lined up for Holiday 2024, the game launched to strong reviews on PlayStation and Xbox back in July 2022, with our sister site Push Square awarding it a very fine 8/10 and calling it &quot;a unique, engaging game with strengths that outshine its flaws.&quot;

Capcom has been really good to Ace Attorney fans over the years, delivering multiple collections - including games that have never been released in the West before — to console owners. And during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the Ace Attorney developer revealed it&#x27;s bringing the final missing piece to the rest of the world.
Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is coming to Switch on 6th September 2024 and bundles together two DS adventures starring prosecutor and fan favourite character Miles Edgeworth. Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth made it to the West back in 2010, but the sequel — Ace Attorney Investigations 2 — never left Japan. At least, until now, and with a new title — Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit.

Nintendo has finally revealed Metroid Prime 4, and it&#x27;s now called Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It&#x27;s planned for release in 2025 and we&#x27;ve got our first look via a new gameplay trailer.
It definitely looks like classic Metroid Prime! Scanning makes a return, Sylux is causing trouble again, and all the usual hallmarks, including missiles, lock-on, and the Morph Ball are present and correct. It&#x27;s incredibly cinematic though, really making use of the Switch&#x27;s extra power. Though we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this one winds up being cross-gen with the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;...

Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was teased a few weeks ago by Square Enix, but during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we got oh, so much more news than just the one game.
First up, Dragon Quest III HD-2D will be launching on Switch on 14th November 2024.

And pop up it has. The new trailer gives us another look at the stunning HD-2D visuals and showcases some of the animation changes that we&#x27;ll be able to catch later this year.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From Dragon Age: Origins&#x27; real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II&#x27;s mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn&#x27;t quite defined the franchise&#x27;s combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series&#x27; origins, I feel it&#x27;s found a great (battle)ground …</span>

                              <span>Bloodborne arrived on PS4 in 2015 and immediately became one of the best games of the year, earning a 9.75 out of 10 from Game Informer and even taking home our award for Best PlayStation Exclusive. But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software&#x27;s most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game&#x27;s many fans.

                              <span>Hot off the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.</span>

                              <span>We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you&#x27;ll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it&#x27;s also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it&#x27;s up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players&#x27; first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new &quot;hand-drawn character visuals&quot; for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</span>

                              <span>In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.


The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today&#x27;s announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994&#x27;s X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</span>

                              <span>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she&#x27;s become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it&#x27;s up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there&#x27;s no clear indication that it is connected to Link&#x27;s Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create &quot;echoes&quot; of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…</span>

                              <span>We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro&#x27;s other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The long-awaited Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake appeared during today&#x27;s highly anticipated Nintendo Direct. We learned much more about the upcoming game, including its release date, which falls in November. On top of that, during Summer Game Fest 2024, we spent about 45 minutes checking out the upcoming retro remake of one of the most beloved and important Dragon Quest games of all time.
In Dragon Quest III, which takes place years prior to the first two games in the series, you step into the shoes of the only child of Ortega, a great hero who failed to defeat Baramos, an …</span>

                              <span>Today’s Nintendo Direct brought news of the welcome return of Donkey Kong to Switch. Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is headed for release on January 16, 2025.
The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.
The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

If you haven&#x27;t checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.
Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth&#x27;s greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.
You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you&#x27;ve already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian&#x27;s ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</span>

This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a &quot;seafaring adventure&quot; that will include new evolved &quot;Bros moves&quot;.


The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</span>

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…</span>

                              <span>Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars&#x27; Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming&#x27;s past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company&#x27;s past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.</span>

                              <span>Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park&#x27;s 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park&#x27;s logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.</span>

While not all blocking requests were honored, this is the first &#x27;dynamic&#x27; order, allowing the targeted domains to be updated.

A relatively small number, just 234, received a financial penalty.

                              <span>Elden Ring fans are likely counting down the seconds until the release of its hotly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion this Friday. For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion&#x27;s content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers and don&#x27;t plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you&#x27;ll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don&#x27;t care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom&#x27;s big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…</span>

                              <span>Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced its previously confirmed summer Direct will air tomorrow, June 18. The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.
The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company&#x27;s fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it&#x27;s likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.</span>

                              <span>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they&#x27;re quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game that closely follows the events of Wu Cheng’en’s seminal novel Journey to the West. The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes…</span>

                              <span>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

                              <span>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not that one. This one. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

                              <span>Fumes has starred in a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It&#x27;s an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

                              <span>Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss&#x27; office for a severe dressing-down. It&#x27;s a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors&#x27; performances are so spot-on, that it&#x27;d feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

                              <span>Well, shovel me timbers! Shovel Knight, the retro platformer that started it all (it all being everything from a roguelike spin-off to a Dead Cells cameo) turns 10 this month, and Yacht Club Games are releasing a ultimate edition to celebrate. Entitled the ‘Shovel Of Hope DX’, this definitive-me-doo bundles in the original game with old and new features like saving and rewinding, over 20 playable characters, local and online co-op, and new modes. Grab your shovel and prepare to dig for the trailer, then look foolish as you realise it’s directly below this paragraph.

                              <span>&quot;Two&#x27;s company, three&#x27;s a crowd,&quot; the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely &quot;three&#x27;s a moderately balanced squad, two&#x27;s a massive liability&quot;? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare&#x27;s Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which &quot;only&quot; allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. It&#x27;s another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more &quot;intimate&quot;, and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&amp;A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

                              <span>This once verdant ground is now wrecked by the passage of time. My terrible nemesis looms before me, inevitable and devastating. Many have fallen to it, but I will overcome. Oh, Elden Ring? I was talking about male pattern baldness. It will eventually destroy all that was once beautiful about my hairline, but at least I’ll have five fancy new hairdos to pick from when the open world RPG’s newest free update releases this Thursday, 20th of June. There’s also some QOL tweaks to inventory management and summoning pools, but I can’t wear those, can I?

                              <span>Beloved friends, hated enemies - last week, we let the side down. Due to a shortage of hands at the pump and persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster. Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself. Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.

                              <span>The developers of Wizard With A Gun are closing down. Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they&#x27;d run out of time to find funding for a new project.

                              <span>You may notice there&#x27;s a stowaway this week. He crept in during all the recent kerfuffle, and secreted himself in a cosy little nook of the treehouse. He was quickly discovered, but despite patient attempts to explain that it&#x27;s  been several years since he was last here, and as per tradition he&#x27;s now dead to us, we&#x27;ve so far been unable to dislodge him. Like the smiley face hidden in the above image, he&#x27;s just... there. So I decided, hell, let&#x27;s hear what he&#x27;s playing this weekend as well.
Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Criminal copyright infringement offenses prosecuted under Russia&#x27;s Criminal Code are expected to plummet by a quarter, thanks to a new law signed by President Putin this week. The amendments aim to &quot;liberalize and humanize&quot; Russian legislation in the area of copyright and related rights, by drastically increasing the threshold for infringement to be considered &#x27;large scale&#x27;.

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. 
The studio also states, “We&#x27;re committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn&#x27;t just another sequel - it&#x27;s a bold new adventure that will la…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy&#x27;s &quot;Find Your Way&quot; music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year&#x27;s Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
&quot;Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct,&quot; the Dual Rulers announcement reads. &quot;Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer.&quot;

                              <span>Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop&#x27;s first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw&#x27;s release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder&#x27;s Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has &quot;auto rock on,&quot; an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…</span>

When I first played Astro&#x27;s Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game&#x27;s short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …</span>

                              <span>Look, everyone wants to play Bloodborne on PC. It’s one of those universally accepted truths, like gravity or pizza being delicious. And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

                              <span>What little rejuvenation reaches my ancient, haggard soul comes most often from pleasant little surprises like a game creeping up on me.
Our Adventurer Guild is cheerfully simple in appearance, and its turn-based fights and griddy missions establish its parts at once as familiar, potentially even by-the-numbers. But those parts are arranged into an original and deceptively detailed mercenary management game that got harder to put down the longer I played.

                              <span>The RPS inbox is a wondrous treasure-trove of distraction doubloons, some delightful, some shite-ful, and not even Outlook’s lichen-like interface can dull the luster of its offerings. In amongst the press releases, indie nuggets, and the occasional pitch for sponsored AI content (no, never), something truly exquisite occasionally peeks through the chest lid. This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

                              <span>Every so often in the ignoble craft of james gournalism you stumble on a game that reminds you why you got into this weird and silly trade, a game that slices through the phantasmagorical mulch of a million Summer Game Fest announcements and clears the portals of the brain. It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today&#x27;s idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I&#x27;ve had a tonne of fun with, when&#x27;s the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It&#x27;s a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year&#x27;s Keighleycon, and it&#x27;s one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it&#x27;s out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so&#x27;s time.

                              <span>Back in February, Graham wrote about potential redundancies at Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive People Make Games documentary. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report here.

                              <span>The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as Kingdom Hearts has come to Steam. The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they&#x27;re not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic&#x27;s storefront. I use the term &quot;open up&quot; loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy&#x27;s cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.

                              <span>Everywhere is a creative suite that aims to let players build their own 3D games - such as shooters, racing games, and platformers - without code. Instead, players can use a developer- and user-created asset library to build and &quot;remix&quot; game worlds, then publish them for other folks to play. 

Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

The Tricky Trials update, out now, might help redirect his bloodlust. It adds trial chambers full of traps and treasure, including waves of hostile mobs to battle against.

                              <span>Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft &#x27;em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it&#x27;s quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It&#x27;s possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018&#x27;s Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

                              <span>Phantom Line, the PVE co-op shooter formerly known as Hornet, has an early demo available until the 18th of June, 2024. It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former Cyberpunk 2077, Bioshock, and Borderlands devs among their ranks. The FPS lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I&#x27;d be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a &quot;top down art adventure with light RPG elements&quot; that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that&#x27;s okay, we are expert curators. Here&#x27;s a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

                              <span>Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That&#x27;s quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay. 
The story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange. Max has moved far away from Arcadia Bay for a fresh start and now works as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University in upstate Vermont. She has sworn to never use her time-rewind ability again, and hasn&#x27;t since the first game&#x27;s conclusion. Despite this, Max’s power has evolved.

Growing up, I didn&#x27;t spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn&#x27;t an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …</span>

                              <span>PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center&#x27;s Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you&#x27;d like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you&#x27;re set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!</span>

Several defendants are now on trial in Las Vegas in a case that generated 19TB of data and 175,000 pages of print discovery, and has taken five years to prepare. After accusing MPA and HBO executives of presenting prejudicial evidence to the jury, the lead defendant called for a mistrial; the government didn&#x27;t give an inch.

Not that it will get dirty forever.” I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the crushing weight of universal entropic decay so keenly as in that RPG maker textbox, nested upon Felvidek’s nicotine-stain hues. I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not Silversun. Sit down, Brian. Let somebody else have a go at answering. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I&#x27;ve played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you&#x27;re being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven&#x27;t got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I&#x27;ll let the game&#x27;s designer tell you then.

                              <span>Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n&#x27; strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It&#x27;s got teeth, but it&#x27;s also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

Citizen Sleeper took me by surprise in 2022, giving me a rare new video game experience, both mechanically and narratively, and my dice-centric role-playing adventure has stuck with me since. I still think about my Sleeper and what they&#x27;re up to now. In a year where Elden Ring didn&#x27;t release, it would have been my game of the year with a bullet – read my Citizen Sleeper review here to find out why. Now, a little more than two years later, I&#x27;ve played parts of the opening hour of Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector and find myself desperate to play more. It brings bac…</span>

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole. It only makes sense that in revisiting such a r…</span>

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.” 
That sentiment was shared by Graham Parkes, who wrote Before Your Eyes and now serves as creative director and writer at Nice Dream. He a…</span>

                              <span>Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character&#x27;s class to attune to different elements. They won&#x27;t be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player&#x27;s party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector&#x27;s Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector&#x27;s edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector&#x27;s edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Visions of Mana Collector&#x27;s Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29.

                              <span>As part of a voluntary agreement with copyright holders, German Internet service providers must block structurally infringing websites. The list expanded recently with Romslab, a site that offers links to pirated games and emulators such as Yuzu and Ryujinx. Official records redact the name of the game company that requested the blockade, but several signs point in the direction of a 135-year-old Japanese corporation.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s solution to IPTV piracy is already operating beyond the limits of its design. Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country&#x27;s ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy&#x27;s blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

Watch the trailer below and tell me I&#x27;m wrong.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a little sheepish about how much I&#x27;m looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It&#x27;s neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it&#x27;ll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That&#x27;s why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

Ahead of that happening, it&#x27;s received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

Set within the world of Riot&#x27;s MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix&#x27;s mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.

A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as &quot;the final chapter&quot;.

                              <span>It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game&#x27;s most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game&#x27;s community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.

                              <span>Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there&#x27;s a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

                              <span>I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid strategy antics of Metal Slug Tactics ever since it was first announced. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

                              <span>AI nowadays is big business and it&#x27;s pretty terrifying, honestly. FACEMINER captures both of these things well, as it sees you build a biometric data processing empire from scratch. And most scary of all, is you&#x27;ll relish upscaling your organisation as you mine mugshots. I mean, I went from, &quot;Hmmm, this is dubious&quot;, to a sicko excited by the fact I didn&#x27;t have to click much to harvest strangers&#x27; portraits. Nic wrote about it a while back, but I&#x27;d like to draw attention to it again as it&#x27;s very good.

                              <span>What a thrill! Oh, wait, actually no. It’s just a release date. We get those all the time. Still, I’m not entirely un-thrilled to learn that stealth action game Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could be arriving as soon as the 17th of November this year, according to a hastily scrubbed X post by retailer GameStop. Thankfully, the folks at the (good, handsome) Ian Games Network grabbed the offending information square before it was deleted. Here’s said square:

It’s a figurative &quot;Go nuts,&quot; and given how much more this narrative-heavy, third-person exploration yarn seemingly has to give, it&#x27;s an attitude I’m seriously hoping holds firm throughout the full game.

Nearby to this now-famous site of grace camps a merry band of blood-cursed Albinaurics, as well as a stupid gross bird you can trick into killing itself over and over again. I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.
Taking place in the fantasy kingdom of Euchronia, Metaphor tells the tale of …</span>

The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details &quot;soon.&quot; 
Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year&#x27;s Madden NFL 24 here. For the first time in years, Madden won&#x27;t be EA&#x27;s only licensed football sim this year, as EA Sports College Football makes its comeback on July 19.

                              <span>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show&#x27;s last.


Season 2 is billed as &quot;the final chapter&quot; and will center on Jinx&#x27;s attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won&#x27;t be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,&quot; said Linke. &quot;From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

                              <span>Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game&#x27;s action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook&#x27;s journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what&#x27;s to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer&#x27;s next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game&#x27;s main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker&#x27;s look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation&#x27;s blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that &quot;is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old.&quot;

                              <span>E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It&#x27;s Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend.

                              <span>Resident Evil continues to gradually infect Apple platforms with the reveal that Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the remake of Resident Evil 2 are coming to iOS. The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is &quot;currently in development.&quot;
Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies.
RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more. At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase. 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil 4 remake, was ported to Apple platforms last year. You can watch us play Resident Evil Village on iPhone in this episode of New Gameplay Today for a look at how well Capcom has managed to get these games to run on phones.</span>

You can read our extensive preview breaking down these sequences here, or you can watch how each of these assassins use their respective talents to relieve enemies of their lives in the video below.

Star Trucker is exactly what it sounds like, transplanting the chill A-to-Z courier journeys of Euro Truck Simulator to the interplanetary, uh, roads of space. It’s out this September, and it looks wonderful.

                              <span>For me, sandbox games are never better when there’s an inherent chaos about to erupt at any given second. In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment&#x27;s open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

                              <span>It’s been five years since Anno 1800, but we’ve finally seen what’s next for Ubisoft’s history-hopping city-building series. Anno 117: Pax Romana will be the earliest period for the franchise yet, travelling back to the time of a peaceful Ancient Rome. After the biggest gap between Anno games yet, we at least won’t have to wait too long for the newly revealed entry: it’s out next year.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed has been threatening to go to Japan for so long that I think the idea has lost its thunder, but I’ll admit to a squee of enthusiasm, during our first look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows, when deuteragonist Naoe grappled onto the ceiling to allow a castle guard to pass innocently beneath. I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

The tease during this evening&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward did nothing for me, other than confirm a name, Mask Of Darkness, and a release window in September.

                              <span>How do you like your coffee? For those who answer: &quot;served by a barista with ten arms wearing a mask adorned with intense scarlet lipstick&quot;, you are in luck. The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it&#x27;s a good souls &#x27;em up remains to be seen. I&#x27;ve only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I&#x27;ve collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game&#x27;s first café.

It’s from Strange Scaffold, of El Paso, Elsewhere and Booked For The Week fame. It is a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage that has you chaining together thrown knives and solar plexus punches, headshots and tree-fu. Lob an empty pistol at your screen, and then replace it, because you’ll need it to watch the trailer below.

                              <span>One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

Yeah, it&#x27;s definitely one to watch.

                              <span>Chef RPG is Stardew Valley but for restaurants instead of farms, the ‘plate’ side of the hypothetical ‘farm to plate’ bundle that Steam may one day sell. Even the set-up is similar to the farming game. You rock up all chef-like off the train, and you&#x27;re soon greeted by your guide Hazel, yet another Boba-clutching robot. I might be misremembering Stardew. Fry yourself off a nice chunk of trai-loumi below.

                              <span>We continue to rummage through the debris caused by the horrendous pile-up of summer video game announcements. Among the wreckage, a release date for Tactical Breach Wizards, the funny strategy game in which you play a ragtag crew of uniformed magic-zappers clearing enemies in confined spaces. It&#x27;s not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That&#x27;s about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don&#x27;t worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.

                              <span>&quot;Deus Ex but tiny and hilarious&quot; is how I pitch the first Streets of Rogue to people in elevators. Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. &quot;It&#x27;s also total chaos!&quot; I yell, as the elevator plummets. &quot;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&quot; Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It&#x27;s coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

Come at me, God! What have you got? Ah. It’s Ale Abbey, a management game about brewing beer in a monastery of medieval monks, and between making craft ales the priests get tipsy on their own supply. You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works on GameJolt for 2 years. But, yes, I suppose now that the developer is teaming up with the Northgard creators as a publisher, the people must know.

The domain name is inaccessible after A records were removed, and its mail server is unreachable too.  Despite days of downtime, there is no sign of enforcement action and no word from the developers either. Meanwhile, its competitor, StreamFab, is picking up new users.

In the process, you may choose to become &quot;the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class&quot;. You can also recruit mercenaries to help you, fight alongside other players in a new PvE co-op activity, &quot;and more&quot;.

                              <span>The rumours of a new Gears of War appearing at today’s Xbox Games Showcase were accurate - well, mostly. The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.

                              <span>Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it&#x27;s sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it&#x27;s perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don&#x27;t just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

                              <span>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Indy’s upcoming FPS adventure game, has a new ‘Official Showcase Reveal’ trailer, officially showcasing and revealing basically nothing about the game except that it features some pretty and decently acted cutscenes, which we already knew from the previous reveal. It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

                              <span>I love me a Flight Simulator, but never more when there&#x27;s some dramatic structure to my flight. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve long been looking forward to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It takes the staggeringly detailed world and flight model of Asobo&#x27;s Flight Sim revival, and adds a job system on top. And now it has a release date: November 19th.

And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game&#x27;s main character, though it&#x27;s ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

It&#x27;s first-person, it&#x27;s got stealth, it&#x27;s got parkour, it&#x27;s got hand-to-hand melee combat including slidekicks. It looks like a mashup of Mirror&#x27;s Edge and something more immersive sim-y? What&#x27;s not to like.

This will be the 2002 game’s second remaster following its Extended Addition re-release in 2014, and aims to thoroughly spiff up the original with a 3D visual overhaul, new animations and texture, plus UI and QOL improvements.

                              <span>The Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake - aka Metal Gear Solid Delta - resurfaced during tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase. We still don’t have a release date, despite signs we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.

                              <span>High prices are among the most commonly cited reasons why people pirate movies, music, books, and other content. But does this mean that lower prices have an effect on piracy in the real world? A clever natural experiment, conducted by academic researchers, shows that price matters. The study found that lower book prices significantly reduced indirect visits to pirate sites.

                              <span>As part of a copyright infringement lawsuit against DoodStream, the cyberlocker platform was handed orders by a court in India to remove links to all content owned by the major Hollywood studios, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, within 24 hours. When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn&#x27;t continue, DoodStream&#x27;s operators and associates are now banned from running the site.
