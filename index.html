As you&#x27;ve probably seen, the new Min Min Super Smash Bros. Ultimate amiibo is now available in-store. If you are planning on adding this one to your collection, here&#x27;s your PSA that this new amiibo based on the fighter from the ARMS series might not actually need to be unboxed to be used.
As highlighted in a post on the amiibo subreddit, this new amiibo&#x27;s packaging may not have an &quot;NFC blocker&quot;, which prevents Nintendo fans from scanning the NFC figure while it&#x27;s still inside the box.

One game here at Nintendo Life we&#x27;re eager to learn more about is Sega&#x27;s upcoming release, Sonic Frontiers.
Right now, we know it&#x27;s coming out in &#x27;Holiday 2022&#x27; and will be an &quot;open-zone&quot; experience. The story is also reportedly penned by Ian Flynn - head writer of IDW&#x27;s current Sonic the Hedgehog comic.

The former Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aim√©, is currently doing the rounds online to promote his new book Disrupting the Game. If you thought you&#x27;ve heard everything he&#x27;s had to say, perhaps not.
In a new teaser (that lacks context and is clearly poking fun) for an upcoming G4TV XPlay interview, Reggie can be seen answering some hard-hitting questions. We do hear him say a little bit in this short time frame, but possibly the most shocking (and hilarious) line is the following: &quot;As an executive, I hated Donkey Konga.&quot;

                              <span>For me, the fun of Rocket League lies entirely in how its supersonic acrobat rocket-powered battle cars control. That means it&#x27;s still fun even if you remove the ball and, say, turn it into a free-for-all battle royale about punting opponent cars out of bounds. That&#x27;s what the time limited Knockout Bash mode does, which is available from now until May 10th.

The seemingly old footage has already been taken down, but the official Skull &amp; Bones Twitter account has tweeted a hint that it won&#x27;t be long before we see something more official.

                              <span>Finding your niche can often be the key to success for smaller developers, but Swedish team Image &amp; Form refuse to be pigeonholed. Over the last ten years they&#x27;ve tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they&#x27;ve finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they&#x27;d built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game&#x27;s titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident.

                              <span>This is just superb.
I&#x27;m not a fan of most fighting games. All too often they have too many elaborate moves, too much memory testing, or they feel like glorified puzzles you have to figure out the one solution to.
Hats Are Not Allowed takes an approach I find far more interesting. Combat is pared down to a few basic principles, and the challenge comes from learning how to combine them, and timing is less about animations than about second guessing your opponent. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s one of the best dueling games ever, but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve played for ages.

                              <span>Battle royale spinoff and subtitle collector Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodhunt launched this week , following a delay to address feedback from its early access phase. That included ample reports of performance issues, but fortunately, what I‚Äôve played over the past couple of days points towards a much more stable brand of last-vamp-standing shootery. Let‚Äôs take a look, then, at Bloodhunt‚Äôs PC performance, system requirements and the best settings to tweak.

                              <span>QA contractors working directly on the next Dragon Age with BioWare Edmonton have filed to unionise, just the latest in a string of such decisions affecting high-profile companies throughout the industry. The workers are employed by the internationally-operating contract services company Keywords Studios but contracted out to BioWare. They‚Äôve now formed the KWS Edmonton United group and have named low pay and concern at being instructed back into the office while Covid-19 remains a danger as their reasons to seek collective bargaining.

                              <span>A rooster calls, and the sun rises as I stock the shelves for another day in Winkeltje: The Little Shop, a business management game about running a little store in a fantasy town. I recently inherited Hefford‚Äôs Hovel and, after a manic start, have managed to become well-known for my loaves of bread. Each day customers charge into the store and raid the various displays, tussling over freshly-baked rolls before scrambling home to slap them on a plate. It‚Äôs mass hysteria, but what can I say? I make damn good bread.
Fresh meals are just one of six item categories you can sell in Winkeltje, but I don‚Äôt need to worry about the rest. Over a few in-game days, your store starts to specialise in the goods you stock, so customers will visit expecting to find those same items. When you enter the Hovel, you‚Äôre greeted with the toasty warmth of the oven as the scent of baking dough drifts through the air. You won‚Äôt see us preparing potions or crafting clothes, no sir. For that, you‚Äôll have to go elsewhere.

That&#x27;s Shotgun King, a roguelikelike turn-based shooter where units (mostly) move like chess pieces, only our lone king has a shotgun. It might sound like a throwaway joke game but Shotgun King is an interesting and fun challenge, especially when your upgrades also bestow different buffs upon the opposing army. And it has a free early version so you can have a go yourself.

So Newcastle isn‚Äôt the Newcastle that&#x27;s been in the Apex Legends backstory for ages, yet he is Newcastle. How does that work? Well, Jackson Williams is Newcastle now. He just wasn‚Äôt always.

The US is once again getting the cutest and coolest additions to the My Nintendo points service. Last time, it was this adorable Kirby shopping bag. Today, it&#x27;s these wonderful-looking Animal Crossing: New Horizons coasters.
This My Nintendo exclusive contains three little coasters, each with our favourite pigeon barista Brewster&#x27;s face printed on the top, all kept neatly together in a matching tin. Nothing beats a good cup of coffee, and this coaster set would make every sip all the more sweet and delectable.

Strange Scaffold&#x27;s hit indie title Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator launched on PC and Xbox via Game Pass last December. However, in a surprise move, the developer has announced that its organ trading sim is out right now on Nintendo Switch. Well, that&#x27;s the quickest deal we&#x27;ve seen in a while!
With a name like Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, you can tell this is going to be something very different. You are an organ trader who makes profits from body parts. Throughout space, you&#x27;ll be trading and selling with unusual clients such as a mysterious astronaut-looking dude named Quartermaster, a fungus (maybe?) called Farmer Popkin, and &quot;legally not a dog&quot; Chad Shakespeare, who looks like a dog.

                              <span>Sometimes fan service just isn&#x27;t enough.
When something becomes popular enough, it is bound to attract imitators. Sometimes those imitators will smash as many different genres together to try to capitalise on multiple other games&#x27; popularity. In the case of Waifu Impact, the developers took the principles that have made Fortnite a bewildering success and combined them with a healthy dose of fan service to attract players, plus a lick of Genshin Impact-style presentation. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with taking what has been popular in the past and serving it up in a new way; players sometimes need a little familiarity to help them settle into a new game. However, a high level of polish is required, and with Waifu Impact that polish just isn‚Äôt there. Even worse than awkward and clunky gameplay, it simply isn‚Äôt fun.
Waifu Impact sees players dropped onto glorious &#x27;Waifu Island&#x27;, a place visited nightly in the dreams of many; a tropical paradise hosting cute girls running around shooting each other with water guns. It is the basic premise that we saw in Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash, but with stripped-back features. Instead of different teams vying for control of the arena, it is a free-for-all against the AI-controlled enemies who all look and play the exact same. Instead of the barely contained chaos, with action coming at you from every angle ‚Äî the things that make other arena shooters fun to play ‚Äî this feels like a slog.

The surreal first-person puzzle game Superliminal from Pillow Castle Games is getting a gorgeous physical release courtesy of Super Rare Games.
Initially launched digitally in 2020, we thought Superliminal was a fantastic experience, blending unique puzzle gameplay with a surprisingly powerful underlying message. We slapped an 8/10 at the end of our review.

Thanks, Miyamoto. You heard that right, folks. A leak has made its way around the internet regarding the plot and various other details for the Super Mario Bros. film, which has recently been delayed into April 2023.

Note: At the original time of publication, online functionality was not yet live for Nintendo Switch Sports. As it is such a crucial part of the game, we decided not to score this review until we can had sampled the full online experience. Having now done just that, here&#x27;s our full updated (and scored) review.

When Wii Sports came out in 2006 it was nothing short of a revelation; beforehand video games had been all but relegated to buttons, knobs, and sticks as a means of controlling them, but the Nintendo Wii and its titular pack-in sports title bust that idea wide open. You all know the story ‚Äî waggle waggle, tennis racquet moves, mum‚Äôs besotted, dodgy elbow next morning ‚Äî but now Nintendo‚Äôs trying to have another pop at the formula (after Wii Sports Resort and we suppose Wii Sports Club) with Nintendo Switch Sports. It‚Äôs been 16 years, but are we looking at 16 years&#x27; worth of improvement?

The Pok√©mon GO expansion for the hugely popular Pok√©mon Trading Card Game is out this July, and we&#x27;ve listed all of the sets that you&#x27;ll be able to pick up when the new cards drop. But yesterday, The Pok√©mon Company gave us a little look at some of the upcoming cards themselves and, as is to be expected with Pok√©mon cards, they look decidedly lovely.
The are on these cards puts many different Pok√©mon in real-life settings, as if you were finding them while playing Pok√©mon GO. Though we&#x27;d be pretty terrified if a life-sized Gyarados was rampaging through our streets with that much water in real life ‚Äî that could cause a flood!

                              <span>Regrets, we&#x27;ve had a few.
There are few moments more exciting than a console launch, especially for a whole new generation. Objectively speaking it&#x27;s not the best time for a system - the pricing of everything is at its peak, there won&#x27;t be many games, and early titles may also struggle to fully show off the technology. Yet the buzz is captivating, and nabbing a launch date console, handheld or Switch-like hybrid on launch day is a special time for plenty of us passionate gamers.
All of the excitement can impair judgement, though, or sometimes the hype falls flat once you&#x27;ve settled down to actually play games. You might spend hundreds of pounds / dollars / euros / whatever and think &quot;oh no, I&#x27;ve made a mistake&quot;.

Nintendo of Japan is doing a solid job sharing tons of detail for Monolith Soft&#x27;s upcoming Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and we&#x27;re lapping up every little bit of detail, especially when it comes to combat.
The Xenoblade series is known for having a plethora of systems to dive into, and with each entry, there&#x27;s only been more and more layered on top. So Nintendo has given us a little look at the basics of battle. This gives us a few new details, and expands on the information the company shared with us last week, though a lot of the information will be familiar to Xenoblade veterans.

Ever since the 3DS eShop, in particular, KEMCO has been a prolific publisher on Nintendo&#x27;s download stores. It&#x27;s continued this run on Switch, with a varied mix of titles but a particularly heavy focus on RPGs, which is undoubtedly welcome for fans of the genre. The next is now confirmed for the eShop (along with PlayStation and Xbox) - Infinite Links arrives on 12th May priced at $14.99USD (and regional equivalents), with a 10% pre-order discount.
Released on mobile in October 2021, to positive user reviews, it seems to have decent depth and mechanics to utilise through its adventure. Some of the official blurb for the game is below:

The &quot;lost game&quot; Metroid 64 was never in development, with Super Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto saying that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t imagine&quot; how Samus would move around a 3D environment with the N64 controller. We only ever got to see and play as Samus in the very first Super Smash Bros. on the console, and that just feels wrong!
Despite offering the opportunity to an outside studio, it couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea for the 64-bit console. Alas, we had to wait until 2002, when we would get two Metroid games within a day of each other ‚Äî Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion.

                              <span>New trailer showcases plenty of gameplay.
Publisher CFK has showcased a brand new trailer for the upcoming remaster of Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony. Originally launched in 2009 for Windows platforms, the game is heavily influenced by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but also injects plenty of &#x27;Touhou&#x27; bullet-hell style gameplay for good measure.
Koumajou Remilia: Scarlet Symphony is due for launch worldwide on July 28th, 2022. Japan will be getting a fancy physical edition, but since the Japanese release will feature English language support, it may well be worth an import if you&#x27;re a fan of the original release.

It also comes with built-in Bluetooth receiver, allowing it to support all sorts of gamepads (PS4, PS5, Switch Pro, Xbox One). Retro gaming mod YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions was sent a kit, and has uploaded an entire breakdown - showing the unboxing, installation and how it works.

The release of Sonic Origins is fast approaching, and as excited as many fans are about this upcoming 4-in-1 collection, there&#x27;s still one question that keeps popping up - will it be getting a physical release?
Sega of America&#x27;s social media manager, Katie Chrzanowski, has touched on this once again in the latest Sonic Official YouTube livestream - reiterating how a physical release currently isn&#x27;t planned right now. The good news is the team (we guess that&#x27;s Sega) is &quot;aware&quot; of the demand for a physical version. Fingers crossed.

One of the ways Sega celebrated 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog last year was by transforming the blue blur into a VTuber. This was followed by his lovable sidekick Tails receiving the same treatment and now it&#x27;s Knuckles&#x27; time to shine.
Yes, that&#x27;s right - in another official Sonic livestream in Japan, Knuckles has made his debut as a VTuber - delivering a message alongside Sonic. It seems like the perfect time, considering how much success Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (featuring Knuckles) has had at the box office.

                              <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy¬†we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio‚Äôs first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he‚Äôs outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are¬†elite Jedi hunters.¬†
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware‚Äôs Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.¬†
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can¬†still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we‚Äôre revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon.¬†
Join Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of¬†12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis‚Äô adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                              <span>Final Fantasy is a staple in JRPGs and video games as a whole. It might have more entries in it than any other series out there and it won‚Äôt be slowing down anytime soon. On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn‚Äôt click for you, there‚Äôs a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too.¬†
However, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best. As a reminder, this ranking is the sum of collective thoughts of the Game Informer staff and your own pers‚Ä¶</span>

Oddly enough, Yoshida‚Äôs reveal about the development of FFXVI doesn‚Äôt come by way of any usual channels like Twitter, a press release, or a development update video. Instead, it comes by way of a new Yoshida interview in a free magazine currently being given away at Uniqlo stores in Japan, as discovered by Twitter user alverich_ff14 and translated by Video Games Chronicle.

That‚Äôs because BioWare and Dark Horse Direct have unveiled a new 14-inch Reaper Sovereign ship replica, and it‚Äôs beautiful. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it‚Äôs something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don‚Äôt have to wait too long to have it in your hands.¬†

‚ÄúReaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,‚Äù Dark Horse‚Äôs description reads. ‚ÄúThis spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.‚Äù¬†
Gentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA‚Äôs Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect.¬†

                              <span>The indie moniker describes a game made by independent creators, i.e., those not under the umbrella of a major publisher. That could mean anything from a solo developer working on a debut title to critically acclaimed teams releasing self-published works. While these games have been around as long as the industry, their popularity surged in the early 2000s. This was partly due to new digital distribution and crowdfunding options, which presented opportunities for some would-be game makers.
Though many of gaming‚Äôs best-loved indies belong to this early era, independently made games reached a whole new level of mainstream attention in the following decades. There are so many launching every day now it can be difficult to keep up. So to help, this list explores the most recent titles that hav‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is the next title in the franchise.¬†
Surprising nobody, especially considering that the company had previously revealed that this year‚Äôs Call of Duty would be a sequel to 2019‚Äôs Call of Duty Modern Warfare reboot, a new teaser dropped on Twitter today revealed not just the title, but the logo for this sequel, too.

As you can see, there‚Äôs really not much to glean¬†from it. It sounds very Modern Warfare-y and looks very Modern Warfare-y, too, but it doesn‚Äôt reveal much about the actual game. Perhaps there‚Äôs something to be made out of the muddled voices playing during the trailer, but it‚Äôs likely that this teaser is just setting the stage for a bigger reveal in the coming weeks or months. The Call of Duty account that tweeted out the teaser does say, ‚ÄúThe new era of Call of Duty is coming,‚Äù so perhaps the company believes this game will shake up the franchise in a big way.¬†
It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising because Infinity¬†Ward&#x27;s¬†2019 Modern Warfare reboot did just that for the series, especially in its rollout a few months before¬†Call of Duty: Warzone. Plus, 2019‚Äôs Modern Warfare is still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty in recent years. With Infinity Ward working on Modern Warfare II, fans are likely excited to see what this sequel looks like. Sadly, there‚Äôs no telling when the next look will be but if it‚Äôs like Call of Duty reveals in years past, we could be weeks or even days away. Only time will tell.
In the meantime, read about how a sequel to Warzone is expected to drop this year and then check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023. Read Game Informer‚Äôs Modern Warfare review after that.¬†

Rogue Legacy 2 has been in early access for a couple of years, building upon its predecessor‚Äôs fun ‚Äì and challenging ‚Äì roguelite formula. You still control members of a warrior bloodline who must battle through a procedurally generated castle rife with dangers. Every death gives you a new character you can outfit with helpful/strange genetic traits, from dealing increased attack damage to farting every time you perform an action.¬†

                              <span>11 Bit Studios‚Äô celebrated anti-war game, This War of Mine, is getting revamped and expanded for a re-release on modern consoles.
Dubbed the Final Cut, the game, in which players manage a party¬†of civilians surviving in a war-torn city, is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S ‚Äìincluding Xbox Game Pass ‚Äì on May 10. It boasts a 4K resolution and a readjusted UI. Content-wise, it includes the locations from the base game and introduces a new character, quests, and events.¬†
Additionally, the three DLC narrative episodes, This War of Mine: Stories, will be available for purchase separately on PS5/XSX. This War of Mine: Complete Edition is a bundle containing Final Cut and Stories if you want everything.¬†¬†
11 Bit Studios, based in Poland, states that the ongoing Ukraine/Russia¬†conflict is the motivator to re-release This War of Mine and repromote its anti-war messaging to a new group of players. The studio recently raised nearly $700,000 for Ukrainian civilian aid by heavily discounting the previous versions of This War of Mine. 11 Bit CEO¬†Przemek Marszal says in a press release:¬†
&quot;The message and themes existing inside of This War of Mine have, unfortunately, become brutally vivid and relevant in recent months. We believe it‚Äôs especially important to educate people on the realities of war right now, while its horrifying reality has become a daily struggle for people that are close to us. We‚Äôre proud that recent This War of Mine fundraising helped us create a wave of spontaneous help for war victims in Ukraine, and we hope we can further spread our antiwar message with This War of Mine: Final Cut.‚Äù

                              <span>Microsoft has announced that an Xbox and Bethesda games showcase will be held this summer.¬†
More specifically, the showcase will air on June 12, beginning at 10 a.m PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. ET, and will feature ‚Äúamazing titles coming from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and our partners around the world.&quot;¬†
As for what to expect, the showcase will focus on games that will soon hit Xbox Series X/S consoles and PC. However, these showcases have been known to surprise-reveal new titles early in development, so it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if games with no release date are showcased.¬†
‚ÄúThe Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase will include everything you need to know about the diverse lineup of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC,‚Äù the Xbox Wire post reads.¬†
Nothing else was revealed besides some links to social and streaming channels where you can watch this showcase. There‚Äôs no mention of specific games, the runtime of the event, or anything like that. However, with Starfield set to release on Nov. 11, there‚Äôs a good chance we finally get a deeper look at what this game is. Only time will tell, though.¬†

                              <span>Looking for a GPU? The RTX 3080 Ti offers comparable performance to the RTX 3090 while costing far less, and today there&#x27;s an OC model available at the card&#x27;s UK RRP. It&#x27;s an Ventus 3X OC model from MSI, with a hefty triple-slot thermal solution that ought to keep the card cool and quiet even running at its factory overclocked 1695MHz. 
To get the discounted price, use code SAVE75 to knock a healthy ¬£75 off the list price. That brings it down to ¬£1054, just ¬£5 more than the UK RRP and a great deal for an OC model. You also get free delivery, with the card slated to arrive just after the upcoming bank holiday.

It&#x27;s also fully compatible with the PS5 thanks to its high speeds and integrated heatsink, making it a great plug-and-play solution for exanding your game storage on the Sony console.

Of all the strange outfits I&#x27;ve seen in Elden Ring, this is one of my favourites. What a joy to see that unlikely gaming icon again, and how gracious of him to visit an easy game for babies.

                              <span>Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, the dev duo that make up Analgesic Productions , seem to make games about scientists. Young, the hero of their Link‚Äôs Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic‚Äôs tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.


When the player begins Analgesic‚Äôs newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: ‚ÄúAmy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.‚Äù

                              <span>After a year in early access, Rogue Legacy 2 has born a 1.0 heir, and it&#x27;s a game I&#x27;ve become well-acquainted with over the last few days. They&#x27;re a complex individual with violent tendencies, but invest in them and they&#x27;ll flower into a roguelike that you won&#x27;t be able to detach yourself from.
The game is a worthy successor to the original Rogue Legacy, and one that builds on it with a wealth of incentives to make your runs more rewarding. Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes. Progression is a pleasure, basically, and it&#x27;s something that never becomes a bore, no matter how good you are at staying alive. I mean, the game is built with death in mind, after all.

We manage to talk about a lot of games in a sensible way, and even gesture at serious discussion of how prestige indies can dominate their niche to the detriment of other interesting games.
Also we talk about holes quite a lot.

The announcement is light on details right now, as you might expect, but there‚Äôs the promise of a ‚Äúdiverse line-up of games coming soon to the Xbox ecosystem, including upcoming releases to Game Pass on Xbox and PC‚Äù. Personally, I&#x27;m hoping we&#x27;ll see our first proper gameplay footage of Starfield, given it launches almost five months to the day from that date. There could also finally be some movement on in-development projects like the next Fable from Playground Games and Undead Labs‚Äô State of Decay 3 too. Here&#x27;s hoping!

                              <span>Exciting news today, folks. Our esteemed Alice0 is stepping into a brand-new role at the RPS Treehouse, morphing from News Editor into our very first Associate Editor. Alice0 has done an incredible job leading the news desk since she joined the site all the way back in 2014, but this new role will give her the space and freedom to step back from the daily news cycle and focus on writing the things she does best: the What&#x27;s Betters of this world, elegies to exploding mouse mats, intriguing mod scene and esports stuff, and posts about more bikes in video games please. Come and congratulate her in the comments below.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve survived Silent Hill and escaped Raccoon City, but are you ready to visit Sunderland? A pleasantly unpleasant new free horror game goes down inside the real Sunderland metro station of Park Lane, and I can&#x27;t think of any other game set in the Northern English city. I am delighted when hyper-local mundanities appear in video games.

The stubby-winged, compact Model Z and Model R-2 arrive as the game sees its ninth update, with plenty of bug fixes, a new Spotlight Event landing challenge and an authentic vapour cone for when you go supersonic in the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Developers Asobo Studio have also patched in their own office in Bordeaux if you want to fly past and wave hello.

Off your cute wee peglin goes on an adventure, battling baddies and claiming treasures, but damage is dealt by pling-plonging orbs down Peggle/pachinko boards and you have a bag of different orbs instead of cards. I like it, and it has a demo you can try for yourself.

                              <span>Until last year, the idea of having a &#x27;forever game&#x27; never really clicked with me. I&#x27;m too old and thin-skinned to enjoy the competitive nature of most online FPS games, and rallying together a regular squad of buddies to tackle the world of games as a service always seemed too much like hard work. Heck, even the allure of daily challenges in some of my favourite single-player games has never quite hooked me in the same way I&#x27;ve seen them take hold in friends and family. But with Dorfromantik, the chill, pastoral village builder from Toukana Interactive, I finally understand the journey towards that mythic &#x27;forever&#x27; status.

While it&#x27;s not disputed that &#x27;Destiny 2 Hacks&#x27; were offered for sale, the court is not convinced that these are copyright infringing. The trademark claims are intact, however, so the case is far from resolved.

                              <span>In his Sifu review for us, Jai found the kung fu brawler difficult enough that at one point he thought he &quot;was going to eat&quot; his controller. He didn&#x27;t, thankfully, and enjoyed the game a lot overall.

The decision comes after months of arguments by Raven and Activision Blizzard management that the employees&#x27; petition be either denied or amended in such a way that, QA staff say, would have drastically reduced the chances of the vote being successful.

                              <span>Corsair make a particularly fine selection of AiOs, also known as all-in-one liquid coolers. They use off-the-shelf designs for their pumps and radiators, as do many other companies, but distinguish themselves with good-quality fans, optional lighting and low prices for a major brand. That last point is particularly pertinent today, as their H100X 240mm AiO has dropped to nearly ¬£60 on Amazon UK - a significantly lower price than any alternative that I&#x27;d rate as highly and some ¬£25 below this AiO&#x27;s original launch price.

                              <span>A new raft of Ryzen 5000 processors has hit virtual and physical shelves, making it a good time to pick up a new AM4 CPU at a discounted price. The appearance of the lower-end Ryzen 5500, 5600 and mid-range 5700X have pushed prices for their more expensive counterparts way down, while the 5800X3D remains hard to find due to its relatively low supply and impressive gaming performance. 
If you were thinking of upgrading, you might be interested to know which retailers in the US and UK are selling each of these processors, and for how much. I was interested myself, so I put together a couple of small spreadsheets to find out - and the results suprised me.

                              <span>Warstride Challenges is a retro-inspired FPS that&#x27;s also a rally game at heart. The game rules and I am smitten with it, mainly because it puts my FPS acumen through its paces: aim, movement, and shrimp-back are all subject to rigorous testing.
But the game also appeals to a primal, competitive side of me. The one that&#x27;s desperate to beat my rival Patrick, a bot who&#x27;s literally programmed to be really good, and Edders, a ghostly version of myself who either strokes my ego or shatters it to pieces.

The update is also dropping for Call of Duty: Vanguard. In addition to new guns and a special timed event featuring Godzilla and King Kong (because of course), this season also sees the debut of some new types of private matches - although Raven have qualified that the latter are temporarily disabled due to ‚Äústability issues‚Äù. At least that gives us time to download the 39GB update for Warzone, but remember to leave 13GB extra room for the patch to copy.

                              <span>The Stanley Parable is a game about a man who leaves his desk one day to discover that all of his most difficult to animate colleagues have vanished. First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There‚Äôs also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.


But most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There‚Äôs an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe ‚Äì a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content ‚Äì there‚Äôs another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.

That means Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and Sonic CD will bid farewell to Steam in their standalone form. Oh well, there‚Äôs always emulation. Or forking out literally twice as much for Sonic Origins, I suppose.

It was here where we saw Potion Craft&#x27;s delightfully detailed little magic tent, for example, as well as the world&#x27;s largest luminescent, inflatable spider, who was on hand repping their new arachnid-based multiplayer lightsaber game, Spiderheck. To talk more about the stand and the publisher&#x27;s upcoming slate of games, we spoke to CEO Alex Nichiporchik, all in the company of his good (and grizzly) friend Larry the bear.

                              <span>Damn. I really have my work cut out for me with this one. I&#x27;ve given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it&#x27;s probably not worth anyone&#x27;s time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.
As I&#x27;ve made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I&#x27;ll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I&#x27;m starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It&#x27;s Worms, but with tanks. It&#x27;s free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.

                              <span>Today‚Äôs the day Bethesda crack open the humongous blast shields at their base in Rockville, Maryland, finally taking the brave step of plonking their back catalogue and future games fully onto Steam after six years of trying to make their own launcher happen. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll have the option to transfer over your games, saves and Wallet balance until May 11th. You&#x27;ll have to redownload everything unfortunately, but any game you happen to own via the Bethesda.net Launcher should appear as a free purchase on a linked Steam account.

After all, it wouldn&#x27;t be PAX, or indeed any kind of convention, without attendees showing off their incredible handiwork, so come and celebrate their sewing needle and glue gun skills by watching the video below.

                              <span>The studio behind the 1930s supernatural mermaid-filled adventure Call Of The Sea have announced their next game, and it looks like a tonally bang-on pastiche of reality shows, social media saturation and 1970s dystopian sci-fi. Published by Raw Fury, American Arcadia centres on Trevor Hills ‚Äì an average bloke in flares, tank top and ‚Äòtache ‚Äì who is a bit too boring to survive the unwitting reality-show metropolis of Arcadia where he lives. Cue a mysterious guide who may or may not be trying to help Trev escape. It&#x27;s good to hear that Yuri Lowenthal and Cissy Jones are back on voice duties, presumably as Trevor and his new pal, after their top-notch performances in Call Of The Sea.

                              <span>I respect shape-making puzzle game Tandis, though I am terrible at it. It&#x27;s a game about bending and distorting shapes by applying mathematical transformations, starting with a simple flat sheet and aiming to replicate elaborate 3D shapes which look like blown glass sculptures. It&#x27;s done cleverly and simply by dragging shapes through zones which distort them in real time but alas, I myself am simple too. Some of the shapes I&#x27;ve accidentally made in Tandis are downright reality-breaking.

Today, the beefy GPU has appeared for just $889 at Newegg, a healthy $110 reduction. That&#x27;s a great price for the best high-end graphics card right now, especially for one that&#x27;s made by the trusted folks at EVGA.

Far: Lone Sails introduced the idea of crafting a ship of questionable quality as it makes its way across a mysterious landscape, and Far: Changing Tides continued those core principles with some fun new twists.
Changing Tides focuses on a seaborne ship that gradually gains new components and features as the player encounters new obstacles. In an especially fitting way to highlight the game‚Äôs distinctiveness, the game makers partnered with Aaron Newman, a professional LEGO-building artist, to create a custom LEGO set of the ship seen in the game. Newman was a LEGO Masters USA Season 1 contestant and has since moved on to be a product designer at The LEGO group, though it‚Äôs important to note ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>May‚Äôs PlayStation Plus games line-up has been revealed (after suffering yet another pre-announcement leak). On May 3, subscribers will have access to the following titles:¬†
FIFA 22: Last year‚Äôs FIFA title boasts new-gen visuals and enhancements, making for a¬†football title that looks better than it ever has.¬†Though it ultimately doesn‚Äôt differ too much from FIFA 21, fans of the sport should find it an enjoyable, if not very familiar, simulator. | Our Review
Tribes of Midgard: This colorful Norse-themed survival action game that you can experience alone or with friends in co-op. You‚Äôll build and manage a village that up to 10 players can occupy, and you‚Äôll maintain it by harvesting materials out in the wild. Plenty of dangers, both earthly and mythical, lurk in the wilderness for you and a party to cut¬†down with your sword.¬†
Curse of the Dead Gods: As an explorer fueled by greed, you‚Äôll explore the depths of perilous temples battling monsters and plundering treasure in this run-based action roguelite. Surviving floor after floor of dangers requires accumulating powerful runes, but gaining power also saddles you with curses for a risk vs reward element. | Our Review
If you haven‚Äôt added April‚Äôs batch of PS Plus titles to your library, you have until May 2 to do so before they become unavailable. You‚Äôll want to do the same for Persona 5, which is also exiting the PS Plus Collection on May 11.¬†
This will presumably be the final month of PS Plus as we know it before the introduction of new¬†premium tiers¬†in June. You can learn more about what that will entail here.</span>

                              <span>Out of the Blue Games, the makers of 2020‚Äôs Call of the Sea, has announced its second title:¬†American Arcadia.
Inspired by works¬†such as The Truman Show, Logan‚Äôs Run, and The Prisoner, the game takes place in Arcadia, a retro-futuristic 1970s city. Players control Trevor Hills, an average town resident who discovers his entire world is just an elaborate reality TV show broadcasted 24/7 to¬†millions of Americans. To escape his false existence, Trevor teams up with the show‚Äôs stage technician, Angela Solano, and the pair must work together to evade the clutches of Arcadia‚Äôs security forces.¬†


American Arcadia features two gameplay styles. Trevor&#x27;s action unfolds as a 2.5D action side-scroller fearing plenty of puzzle-solving as well as elements of stealth. Controlling Angela shifts the game¬†to first-person to complete specific hacking and puzzle segments. Cissy Jones and Yuri Lowenthal, who portrayed Call of the Sea‚Äôs protagonists, reunite¬†to voice Angela and Trevor, respectively.
American Arcadia has already been selected for Tribeca‚Äôs 2022 Festival Games. It will launch for PC and unspecified consoles, but¬†it does not have a release window.</span>

                              <span>Disney fans, take note. Today, Gameloft announced a new free-to-play life-simulation adventure game called Disney Dreamlight Valley. In it, you brush shoulders with various Disney and Pixar characters, creating your own avatar and life in their magical world. The adventure challenges you to uncover the mysteries of Dreamlight Valley, where its inhabitants have lost their memories due to an event called The Forgetting. You must solve the case and¬†restore the now desolate place¬†to its former glory, putting your own mark on it in the process.
The reveal trailer above should give you a taste of the experience, where you¬†enter classic Disney and Pixar worlds and help¬†iconic characters get back their memories. A big bonus? You&#x27;ll also be designing your own villages with various Disney items and customization options, from Frozen-inspired antique kitchen designs for your abode to princess-inspired ballgowns for your avatar.
During your journey, you can interact with and befriend¬†popular franchise characters¬†who have their¬†own unique story arcs. The press release confirms¬†familiar faces will appear from¬†The Lion King, The Little¬†Mermaid,¬†Toy Story, and¬†Moana. It also promises fun activities like cooking Disney-themed dishes alongside Remy from Ratatouille, fishing with Goofy, and growing vegetables from Wall-E&#x27;s garden patch.¬†
This summer, the¬†game enters¬†Early Access, which you can join by purchasing a Founders Pack or by being an Xbox Game Pass member. As an early adopter, you get to not only provide feedback to the development team but you&#x27;ll also earn exclusive awards, which will carry over when the full game releases. Disney Dreamlight Valley is currently set for an official launch in 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Mac.¬†

                              <span>From Software released a new patch today that fixes a Malenia bug that unintentionally made the boss fight much harder.¬†
Dubbed Update Version 1.04.1, this patch fixes a bug with the Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight in Elden Ring‚Äôs endgame that allowed her to heal herself at any time if you were in online co-op. This was a problem because Malenia is only supposed to self-heal upon damaging you, in a vampiric way. That she was able to self-heal at really any time was causing quite the conundrum for players looking to defeat her, who is already arguably the most challenging boss in the entire game. This new patch fixes that fortunately, and it brings with it a few other fixes too.¬†


Here‚Äôs what Update Version 1.04.1 brings to Elden Ring:¬†
Fixed a bug in which the effect duration of the Cerulean Hidden Tears was revised downward
Fixed a bug with Malenia, Blade of Miquella in which her HP was not healed correctly in the online multiplayer environment
Fixed a bug that causes some bosses to die at unintended times.
Fixed a bug that prevented the boss ‚ÄúElden Beast‚Äù from working properly under certain circumstances
Fixed some texts
‚ÄúThe version number of this update shown at the lower right corner of the Title Screen will be as follows: App Ver. 1.04.1, Regulation Ver. 1.04.2,‚Äù the patch notes read.¬†
As expected, in order to play online in Elden Ring, you must have this update installed. For more about the game, read Game Informer‚Äôs Elden Ring review and then check out this story about an Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the closed colosseum, where once inside, they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies. Read about a recent update that adjusted sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that.¬†

                              <span>I might not have owned Nintendo‚Äôs seventh-generation home console when Wii Sports launched in 2006, but I was well aware of its cultural impact. I recall booting up the wacky sports simulator at my sister‚Äôs apartment and joyously swinging my Remote/Nunchuk to hit a baseball, throw a quick jab, or swing a golf club. So, it feels serendipitous that I‚Äôm reviewing Switch Sports 16 years later. Diving into the second sequel‚Äôs six activities alone and with friends (locally) has been a fun, nostalgic rush. I haven‚Äôt had access to the game&#x27;s online multiplayer component, which, as you can imagine, houses a bulk of Switch Sports‚Äô content. So, while I can‚Äôt talk about ranked progression, the cosmetic/currency systems, and exclusively-online modes, here are my thoughts on everything else.¬†

                              <span>Matt Reeves‚Äô The Batman is getting a sequel, to probably nobody‚Äôs surprise.¬†
Not only did the movie do really well at the box office, especially as the silver screen continues to struggle to bounce back amidst the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, but it was well-received by both critics and fans alike. Now, DC has confirmed that The Batman will get a sequel with Matt Reeves returning to write and¬†direct and Robert Pattinson set to reprise his¬†role¬†as¬†the Caped Crusader, as reported by Variety.¬†
The publication notes that this was announced last night during Warner Bros. CinemaCon presentation and while the company revealed a sequel is happening, not much else was shared. As for a villain or storyline, we‚Äôre all still just as in the dark as we were before the sequel was revealed. However, those who have seen The Batman, which is now streaming on HBO Max for subscribers, there are a number of threads the sequel could move forward with, both in terms of potential villains and potential storylines. We won‚Äôt spoil those threads here, but The Batman sequel seems to be heading in a certain direction.¬†
The Batman hit theaters last month, raking in $134 million domestically, Variety reports, and its ticket sales still represent the biggest opening weekend for any movie in 2022. Today, its global box office sits around $759 million, making it the highest grossing movie of the year thus far (although Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is eyeing that throne).¬†
While waiting for a sequel to The Batman, read Game Informer‚Äôs coverage of two upcoming DC games, Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League.¬†

                              <span>The Crucial P2 is a popular budget NVMe SSD, and today it&#x27;s decidedly more budget than usual. GameStop are selling the massive 2TB variant of the drive for just $155.99, some $15 less than the cheapest comparable drive anywhere else and way below the $174 that Amazon are charging. That&#x27;s a great deal for a drive that we wholeheartedly recommend - especially when it&#x27;s down to crazy-low prices like this.

                              <span>Back in 2018, Blizzard teased that they&#x27;d be announcing something related to Diablo at Blizzcon but that it would not be &quot;what many of you are hoping for&quot;. Sure enough, it wasn&#x27;t Diablo 4 , but a mobile game called Diablo Immortal. Blizzard&#x27;s warnings didn&#x27;t stop the developers from being booed on stage at Blizzcon, which seemed harsh.

Now that Diablo 4 has been announced (in 2019) and we&#x27;ve seen all the ways it&#x27;s catering to fans of classic Diablo 2, perhaps the world is ready for Immortals. If that&#x27;s so, then good news: it&#x27;s now also coming to PC, with a free-to-play open beta on June 2nd.

                              <span>I continue to play Framed every day, a browser quiz in which you attempt to guess a movie based on an image from the film. Get it wrong and it shows you another image, and so on.

The terribly named Moviedle does something different. The aim, again, is to identify a movie, but instead of a single frame, it squeezes the entire movie into a single second. Get it wrong and you get a two-second version, and so on.

It adds far bigger maps than Galactic Civilizations 3, along with the opportunity to bring more worlds into your dastardly empire or benevolent federation than before. All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher&#x27;s Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated.

                              <span>Warstride Challenges is an early access FPS that takes the retro shoot &#x27;em up and straps it in a rally car. Each level is a course with straights and corners and demons. You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you&#x27;ve turned every demon along the way into a red paste.
The game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It&#x27;s quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that&#x27;s worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it&#x27;s a payoff you&#x27;ll remember.

It&#x27;s a roguelikelike dungeon crawler that&#x27;s all about inventory Tetris, filling your knapsack with weapons, armour, and items that can gain powerful bonuses and synergies depending on their placement. It&#x27;s an interesting and fluid bit of buildcrafting, and has me excited for the full game next year.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to complain about The Iron Oath a lot. Not because it&#x27;s bad, but because I&#x27;m really enjoying it, and I think it has the potential to really take off.
Think of these complaints, for the most part, as a pre-flight checklist done long before the pilot has even sat down; if the game were not in early access, these would be big disappointments rather than exactly the kind of annoying details that early access is meant to iron out.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck software update is a biggun, with Valve adding an arguably overdue lock screen to their handheld PC. This new PIN protection leads a bevy of other features including localised keyboards, a redesigned achievements page, and support for games and apps with multiple windows, which you can now flick between via the Steam button menu.


Without the update, it‚Äôs possible to just sign into your Steam account once and never need to punch in credentials again, even after a full restart. This is convenient, especially if your Steam Deck isn‚Äôt at risk of chicanery from young siblings or vengeful housemates, but giving it the Deck a lock screen goes a long way in guarding it from prying hands. It‚Äôs definitely worth the longer-than-usual update installation, at any rate.

                              <span>Sega has announced plans to delist the digital versions of the classic Sonic games that will be included in its upcoming Sonic Origins collection.
Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3 &amp; Knuckles, and CD will be removed from online storefronts on May 20, a little over a month before the June 30¬†launch of Sonic Origins. There will be two exceptions. The Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 for Switch will remain playable. The same immunity applies to Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis library¬†for¬†the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.
Sega has not cited a reason for this move, but the publisher evidently wants to steer players towards Origins if they want their classic Sonic fix. Rockstar Games made a similar move when it delisted the PC versions of the Grand Theft Auto games that appeared in last year‚Äôs ill-fated Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy ‚Äì Definitive Edition. The decision earned significant backlash from fans before the collection launched, as many felt Rockstar was limiting their options for purchasing the classic entries. That situation further backfired due to the Trilogy‚Äôs botched release, and Rockstar eventually restored the standalone GTA titles to PC storefronts.¬†
Sonic Origins bundles remastered versions of the Genesis-era platformers. It boasts enhancements such as new and improved animations, new gameplay modes, and the option to play as Tails/Knuckles in each game, among other features. It‚Äôs slated to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms, Switch, and PC. The game comes in two editions¬†‚Äì a $39.99 standard version and a $44.99 Deluxe ‚Äì with a few content packs that you can read about here.</span>

                              <span>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have teased new details about the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sequel, showcasing the first 15 minutes to audiences at CinemaCon last night.¬†
Reports from Variety, Gizmodo, and more indicate those 15 minutes were very hype but perhaps more interesting for those who weren‚Äôt fortunate enough to see the 15 minutes. The producer duo also teased that Across the Spider-Verse will contain more than 200¬†characters. More specifically, it will have 240 characters, which is quite a significant jump from Into the Spider-Verse‚Äôs 40 characters, Variety reports.¬†


The producers also shared that Across the Spider-Verse takes place across six different universes, starting on Earth-65, where Hailee Steinfeld‚Äôs Gwen Stacy li‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Epic Games has announced that the next artist in its Soundwave Series, which sees artists from around the world perform on creative islands, is rapper Emicida.¬†
Emicida is one of the biggest rappers in Brazil, and his performance will begin Friday, April 29, at 6 p.m. EST. It will repeat non-stop for 72 hours until Monday, May 2, at 6 p.m. EST. To accompany Emicida‚Äôs performance, the Keep Going Lobby Track and Triumphant Emote will be available in the Fortnite Item Shop starting this Thursday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST. Upon completing Emicada‚Äôs experience, you‚Äôll receive some XP and the Soundwave Series ‚Äì Emicada Spray as a memento from the show.¬†
As for what to expect beyond the actual performance, you‚Äôll find a creative island inspired by Emicida‚Äôs life journey and how it influenced his music, made by community creators BertBuilds, Paradox Builds, and Zen Creative.¬†
‚ÄúThe setlist, which includes some of Emicida‚Äôs biggest hits, tells the story of how he grew up in Jardim Cachoeira in the north of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and became one of the most popular rappers in Brazil and a successful artist worldwide,‚Äù an Epic Games blog post reads. ‚ÄúIn the experience, Emicida shares a bit of his path as a rapper, from where he was doing street rap battles to becoming recognized internationally.‚Äù¬†

Players will have the option to watch the show via Picture-in-Picture while playing other Creative Experiences, Battle Royale, and more if they don‚Äôt want to experience it on the creator-built island. However, Epic Games says this is available only during certain times of the event. It can be accessed through the game‚Äôs settings, but interactive elements will not be playable if the experience is viewed through Picture-in-Picture.¬†

                              <span>Players suspect¬†that a closed colosseum in Elden Ring could be the location for a potential PvP-based DLC or expansion. Popular From Software modder Lance McDonald was able to look inside it with a mod. He confirmed that the colosseum‚Äôs outer walls aren‚Äôt just set dressing but actual walls to¬†an arena.¬†
As reported by Video Games Chronicle, another From Software modder, Sekiro Dubi, used a mod¬†to enter the colosseum and explore it even further. Surprisingly, Sekiro Dubi discovered not just a colosseum to explore, but two additional Elden Ring enemies and even a new Site of Grace, which are Elden Ring‚Äôs version of Dark Souls&#x27;¬†bonfires.¬†


As noted by VGC, the Site of Grace seems to indicate that this area was reachable within the game at one point or another, unless, of course, this Site of Grace will become reachable one day in a patch or DLC that allows players into the colosseum. Sekiro Dubi notes in their video above that the Site of Grace is called ‚Äú?PlaceName?‚Äù (an obvious placeholder name) in the locations menu, but they point out that leaked Network Test files point to it being called Leyndell Colosseum.¬†
As far as new enemies go, there‚Äôs a Gladiator Large and an Old Lion of the Arena, neither of which can be found elsewhere in Elden Ring. Sekiro Dubi notes that in-game lore indicates¬†that this colosseum was a place where warriors fought against beasts.¬†
For now, this colosseum remains inaccessible to the standard playerbase as it‚Äôs only reachable via mods. However, many speculate that it will become a PvP arena someday. Only time will tell.¬†

                              <span>With Apex Legends Season 12 coming to a close, fans have been eagerly waiting for news about the next chapter in Respawn‚Äôs battle royale and what it has to offer. A cinematic trailer dropped yesterday, revealing the game‚Äôs next defensive legend, Newcastle, while showcasing Titanfall Spectres and feral wildlife along Storm Point‚Äôs tropical beaches. You can watch the footage below.¬†


Apex loremasters might already know that Bangalore has a friendly rivalry and close relationship with her older brother, Jackson. While protecting Bangalore during the Battle of Gridiron, Jackson is presumed KIA. We join Bangalore after some time has passed; she‚Äôs announced her retirement from the Apex Games. At the same time, a masked defender named Newcastle is slated to be her replacement. Of course, explosive hijinks ensue while the two squad up for Bangalore‚Äôs final battle royale match. Bullets whiz past faces, grenades leave craters in the sand, and Titanfall Spectres ambush our favorite legends while they slay a massive beast. Bangalore is surprised to learn the truth behind Newcastle‚Äôs mysterious identity by the end of it all.
Season 13 ‚ÄúSaviors‚Äù might shift up the meta with the inclusion of Newcastle. While the terminology for the character‚Äôs abilities isn&#x27;t clear, it‚Äôs safe to assume that he‚Äôll keep his teammates safe with well-timed fortifications. According to speculation, he might even be able to drag downed allies out of the fight while reviving them. If this holds, then we‚Äôre in for significant changes in the casual and competitive levels of play.¬†

                              <span>Nintendo and Universal‚Äôs Illumination Entertainment‚Äôs upcoming film adaptation of the Super Mario Bros. series is delayed to next spring.¬†
Instead of hitting theaters on Dec. 21 of this year, the movie will be released on April 7 in North America and a few weeks later in Japan, on April 28. This announcement came by way of a rather odd tweet from the Nintendo of America account that seems to indicate the news comes straight from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself.¬†
This is Miyamoto. After consulting with Chris-san, my partner at Illumination on the Super Mario Bros. film, we decided to move the global release to Spring 2023‚ÄìApril 28 in Japan and April 7 in North America. My deepest apologies but I promise it will be well worth the wait.
April 26, 2022
The Illumination Twitter account released the news at the same time last night with a similar message.¬†
‚ÄúMiyamoto-san and I have been collaborating on all aspects of the Super Mario Bros. film and, together with our partners at Universal, have decided to move the global release to Spring 2023 ‚Äì April 7 in North America and April 28 in Japan. We are excited to share this incredible film with you.‚Äù¬†
As you can see, neither company lists a definitive reason¬†for the delay, but it seems like the movie simply needed some additional time in the oven. Considering that this is Nintendo‚Äôs first significant foray into animated silver screen features and how big the Mario brand is, it makes sense to take all the time needed to make this movie the best it can be.¬†
Reports from November of last year indicated that Nintendo was happy with the film thus far. Miyamoto¬†reportedly even hinted that more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. While waiting to see if that becomes true, check out the complete cast list for this Super Mario Bros. film.¬†

                              <span>Sony has announced that a new feature is coming to the PlayStation 5 this week. The long-awaited addition of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) is coming within a few days, and a handful of games will support the feature in the coming weeks.
In a blog post today, Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at PlayStation, introduced VRR and described the basics of¬†how it works. &quot;On HDMI 2.1 VRR-compatible TVs and PC monitors, VRR dynamically syncs the refresh rate of the display to the PS5 console‚Äôs graphical output. This enhances visual performance for PS5 games by minimizing or eliminating visual artifacts, such as frame pacing issues and screen tearing,&quot; writes Nishino. ‚ÄúIt causes the games to look smoother overall and can even reduce input latency.‚Äù

This driver was previously a proprietary, commercial offering from the company but given the state of NTFS these days they wanted to upstream this driver with full read/write support and other features not found within the existing NTFS driver. Finally last year after going through many rounds of review, the new driver was merged into Linux 5.15.

The Court finds that the legislation, which could boost the use of &#x27;upload filters,&#x27; does not violate freedom of expression, as long as they can sufficiently distinguish between illegal and legal content. This effectively puts an end to years of opposition.

                              <span>A forthcoming Pok√©mon Go update will dramatically overhaul the game&#x27;s current approach to Mega Evolutions. As they stand now, Mega Evolutions require a hefty amount of candy for a particular Pok√©mon to evolve into its larger form, which is only available for a set amount of time. Each time the player wants to use this powerful form, more candy is required, and it isn&#x27;t easy to come by, as it is tied to timed raids and missions.
After the update hits, there will be a one-time cost for Mega Evolving a Pok√©mon, meaning you can evolve it freely without using more candy. The only catch here is that your Pok√©mon will become fatigued after transforming and will need time to regain its fighting form before evolving again. Mega Energy can be used to reduce the amount of time it takes for that Pok√©m‚Ä¶</span>

Overwatch 2 was announced in 2019, and following years of development, the updated hero shooter is¬†headed into its first PvP beta test starting tomorrow. Ahead of the beta, Blizzard Entertainment has posted a FAQ about the test, answering all kinds of questions about who can participate, when the test goes live, and how one can join in on the fun.¬†We&#x27;ve combed through the FAQ to sift out the most crucial info you need to know.¬†
First, players who have been selected to participate will recieve an email to whichever address their Blizzard account is linked to.¬†Those emails will be sent out starting tomorrow morning and will continue to be sent¬†to more participants throughout the day. To play in the Overwatch 2 beta, you&#x27;ll have to own a copy of the original Overwatch on PC. T‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft has officially revealed Project Q, a multiplayer arena battler that¬†leaked last year.¬†
In September 2021, a list of upcoming PC games was datamined and leaked from Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce Now. As Eurogamer reported at the time, Project Q was one of four codenamed titles listed by Ubisoft, who issued a DCMA takedown of the list once it hit online.¬†¬†
The French publisher confirmed Project Q‚Äôs existence on Twitter on Saturday, stating that the game is in early development and that players can register for upcoming gameplay tests. The timeframe for these tests is unknown.¬†Ubisoft subsequently clarified in the same Twitter thread that Project Q is not a battle royale and will feature several PvP modes. It also states there are no plans to add NFTs to the game, evidently a concern given Ubisoft‚Äôs enthusiastic foray into the concept with its ill-received Quartz platform.¬†

Leaked playtest footage from Exputer shows a couple of matches from the game. It appears to be a colorful third-person shooter not unlike Fortnite with zany weapons such as a fireworks gun and melee items such as a staff and even Thor‚Äôs hammer, Mjolnir.¬†
According to Project Q‚Äôs registration site, the game is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Ubisoft Connect. It does not have a release window.¬†¬†
In other recent Ubisoft news, several private firms are apparently looking to acquire the publisher. In terms of other new multiplayer titles, a new Ghost Recon game has entered development.</span>

                              <span>The RTX 3070 Ti is a great mid-range to high-end GPU, with excellent performance in rasterised games plus DLSS and RT support, but it&#x27;s been hard to find at a good price if you haven&#x27;t lucked out with a Founders Edition restock. Prices for third-party cards are slowly falling, and now have reached within ¬£100 of the ¬£549 UK RRP - an important milestone for GPUs that cost ¬£1000 or more at the beginning of the year. 
The cheapest RTX 3070 Ti model we&#x27;ve found is a Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Trinity at Ebuyer, who are asking ¬£649 with a despatch date of April 26th(tomorrow!). If you want the cheapest model that&#x27;s in stock right now, then that&#x27;ll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for ¬£10 more. Either way, you&#x27;ll be left with a performant graphics card that requires only a modest 750W PSU, less than Nvidia&#x27;s higher-end GPUs and much less than the company&#x27;s next-gen products rumoured to arrive towards the end of this year.

That makes it a great time to upgrade your PC with 1TB of fast storage for a historic low price.

Two Point Studios have shown off a new trailer for one of the courses to expect when you arrive on campus, which has a lot of the potion brewing and casting of spells that you‚Äôd expect from even a magical academic establishment.

                              <span>Not to damn with faint praise, but the Lenovo Legion 5 is kinda okay. A bit alright. Reasonably reasonable. It‚Äôs a gaming laptop with specs, price and performance that are so straight down the middle of the road that they might as well be studded with cat‚Äôs eyes. Apologies in advance if this is not the most action-packed hardware review you‚Äôve ever read.

                              <span>Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.
The game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You‚Äôll probably know already whether you‚Äôd be interested in giving it a go: after all, it‚Äôs Prop Hunt. But it‚Äôs also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I‚Äôve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter‚Äôs eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I‚Äôm tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other‚Äôs heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I‚Äôd say we had a good time.

                              <span>Right, housekeeping first. Dune: Spice Wars‚Äô Steam page describes it as a  ‚Äúreal-time strategy game with 4X elements‚Äù. An odd choice, considering Shiro Games themselves downplay RTS elements in a Steam blog. Spice Wars is as much 4X as the dead eyes of two smiley faces, and one with enough forward momentum as to make such tantalising lies unnecessary. Embrace your grand strategy! It‚Äôs like John Dune always said: ‚ÄúFear is the path to the dark side, Malcolm Reynolds‚Äù.

It is TikTok&#x27;s text-to-speech voice, and it is everywhere. Now it&#x27;s even in Half-Life, thanks to a mod which replaces the opening tram ride voiceover with a TikTok TTS version. It&#x27;s a distressing artifact, and I hate that it kinda works. See/hear for yourself in the video below.

                              <span>The EU has reached an agreement on the final text of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The new legislation sets clear guidelines for how online platforms and services must prevent abuse and the spread of illegal and harmful content. The DSA will help to keep &quot;big tech&quot; accountable and also comes with some new rules and requirements for takedown notices.

                              <span>Of all the booths at PAX East 2022 this year, Larian&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate III stand was by far one of the most impressive. Not only did they construct an entire walled city to hark back to its iconic, titular location, but they also had an enormous Nautiloid crashed into the top of it. There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they&#x27;d do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more.

                              <span>Day Three of PAX East 2022 is done and dusted for another year, which means it&#x27;s time for another daily round-up video. We had another jam-packed schedule today, checking out Dome Keeper (formerly known as Ludum Dare darling Dome Romantik) over on the Raw Fury booth, before heading over to the PAX Rising Showcase to check out a specially curated selection of upcoming indie games. We also caught up with Larian to chat about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (watch out for a dedicated video coming in the next day or two), and we capped off the day by attending Shirley &quot;Skyrim Grandma&quot; Curry&#x27;s panel over on the Bumblebee Theatre stage. I&#x27;ll be writing up a separate post about this in the coming days, but needless to say, Shirley was an absolute delight.

                              <span>The first McPixel was one of those point and click adventures that was just so wholesomely silly that it won you over with its mix of daft humour and bonkers, quickfire &#x27;save the day&#x27; scenarios. Now, everyone&#x27;s favourite bomb disposal expert is back in McPixel 3 (solo developer Sos Sosowski prefers we never mention the likes of McPixel 2), which we got to see in action over at the Devolver booth at PAX East 2022. Sosowski took the reins for us in this demo, showing us exactly how not to save the world in this equally comedic sequel, proving that the McPixel formula is still just as potent ten years on from the original.

                              <span>PC hardare modding is never something I had the guts to try during my time in the RPS hardware mines, but after attending The Evolution Of PC Modding panel at PAX East this week, I wish I&#x27;d been a little bolder. Moderated by Overclocking-TV.com&#x27;s Isa√Øe &quot;Trouffman&quot; Simonnet with special guests Joe Gialanella from ModMyMods, Eric &quot;hobbseltoff&quot; Hobbs from PC Modding Enthusiast, and Justin &quot;Robeytech&quot; Robey, these four experts took us through the history of PC modding over the last 15 years, the highs and lows of some of their very own builds, and what lies in store for PC modding going forward. It was a fascinating panel, and we caught up with Simonnet afterwards to try and recapture some of that excellent hardware chat for you folks at home.

That&#x27;s what first-person shooter Sentry does. Sentry is an &quot;action-defense&quot; shooter in which you&#x27;re protecting a spaceship from waves of aliens, alone or in co-op, by placing traps and blasting heads. You&#x27;ll find the trailer below.

                              <span>Over the past months, it has become clear that Google is voluntarily helping rightsholders to tackle online piracy. The search giant has now removed another batch of &#x27;pirate site&#x27; URLs from its results in the Netherlands, just days after a local ISP was ordered to block them. While it&#x27;s a big step to take, Google hasn&#x27;t yet commented on the matter.

                              <span>Potionomics seems to contain several things I&#x27;d like from a video game. It&#x27;s got brewing potions, yes, that&#x27;s good. There&#x27;s shopkeeping, I like that a lot. Then there&#x27;s a card-driven social system for haggling with customers - perfect. Recettear meets Potion Craft meets Signs Of The Sojourner? With beautiful character animation? Gold.

                              <span>Darwinia is a fabulous, offbeat strategy game set inside a virtual world overrun by a virus. It&#x27;s an early indie classic. It&#x27;s possibly Introversion&#x27;s best game - though, god, that&#x27;s a close call. It&#x27;s also now fully remastered.

Darwinia&#x27;s 10,000th anniversary edition launched this week, with a newly re-written graphics engine, support for surround sound, cloud saves, Steam Deck, and various bug fixes. Lovely stuff.

That project was canned and the studio closed, but now Hennig is getting another swing at the galaxy that&#x27;s far, far away. Her new studio, Skydance New Media, has partnered with Lucasfilm Games to to produce a &quot;richly cinematic action-adventure game&quot; with an original Star Wars story.

Sometimes the wind makes the water outside the window move in the opposite direction it&#x27;s supposed to. If I look outside I get travel sick. What fresh hell. No, no, far better to close the curtains &#x27;gainst the cruelties of nature, and stare at a reassuringly solid screen instead. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend.

                              <span>We&#x27;re now halfway through PAX East 2022, which can only mean one thing: it&#x27;s time for our second daily round-up video. Instead of plonking ourselves in the middle of the empty show floor after hours, we snuck back into Devolver&#x27;s booth to film our Friday catch-up, where we started our day some 10 hours beforehand. We got the lowdown on McPixel 3 from solo dev Sos Sosowski, and marvelled once again at the lovely overgrown arcade cabinets of reverse citybuilder Terra Nil. We then moved over to the Focus stand to play supernatural cowboy slayer Evil West and the ultra fast FPS Warstride Challenges. We also stopped by the Pinny Arcade communtiy meet-up today, and sat in on a couple of panels, including one about the history of PC hardware modding and a Wordle Royale. Find out exactly what that means in the video below.

                              <span>Pretend it&#x27;s Thursday for a second. We&#x27;ve just emerged from Gearbox&#x27;s 80-minute panel at PAX East 2022, and we&#x27;re wondering how they managed to spend so much time talking about so little. You know something&#x27;s gone wrong in a conference when you&#x27;ve got an entire segment dedicated to just merch, and Gearbox groupies are hollering for Tiny Tina G-Fuel cans like it was mana from heaven. Lucky for you, we suffered through all the merch plugs, the failed trailer loads, nothing announcements and yet another 20-minute magic set to bring you this condensed version of Gearbox&#x27;s panel news, all so you don&#x27;t have to suffer through that interminably long stream. Here&#x27;s everything you need to know from the Gearbox Main Theatre Show panel in 5 minutes.

                              <span>Recently, we asked what&#x27;s the deal with all the wacky golf games coming out this year? Well, we thought we better answer that question by going straight to the source. While we were out at PAX East 2022, we tracked down the director of upcoming roguelike Cursed To Golf, Liam Edwards. As well as asking him about the enduring appeal of sunny green fairways, we also putted our way through its excellent PAX East demo, discovering this golflike is anything but cursed.

                              <span>The current sweet spot for gaming monitors is simple: 27 inches, 2560 by 1440 resolution, 165Hz refresh rate and FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. That gives you a sharp image, good fluidity for fast-paced games and the technologies to smooth out uneven frame-rates with little input lag - and all at a reasonable price. These sort of monitors normally cost around $300, but today retailer Antonline is selling the well-reviewed Lenovo G27Q for just $200 - after a mega $150 reduction. 
I think it&#x27;s the best monitor deal I&#x27;ve seen for months, so let me tell you more about it.

                              <span>Corsair&#x27;s ML (magnetic levitation) fans are a popular choice for system builders, thanks to their high RPM range, good cooling performance and better durability than traditional designs. The latest edition is the RGB Elite, which offers improved acoustics over its predecessors, and it&#x27;s this one that&#x27;s been discounted at Amazon UK today. A triple pack with an iCUE Lighting Node Core normally costs ¬£85, but today that price has dropped to ¬£60 - a 29% percent reduction. I reckon this is a great shout if you&#x27;re planning a new build or upgrading basic case fans, and in fact I&#x27;ve even placed an order for my own PC.

                              <span>There are plenty of space exploration games that take after Elite. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they&#x27;re often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it&#x27;s not only good, it&#x27;s doing things completely differently.
It&#x27;s a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I&#x27;d be very surprised if you don&#x27;t enjoy it.

                              <span>Bestest monster frenemies King Kong and Godzilla will get to break stuff in season three of Call Of Duty: Warzone and Vanguard battle royale, Activision has announced. Cue much bellowing.


Dubbing Godzilla and Kong as ‚ÄòTitans‚Äô of Universal Pictures‚Äô Monsterverse, Call Of Duty is introducing the pair to the Caldera map in the time-limited Operation Monarch event beginning May 11th. According to the patch notes, Monarch is the name of the organisation that tracks down these cryptozoological Titans. Somehow there have been two movies starring the big ape-lad and the large dragon with bad breath now, one of which came out last year. I guess this is a tie-in to that one.

Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford ‚Äì who stepped aside as head of Gearbox Software last October ‚Äì dropped the existence of the project right at the end of the PAX East presentation while wearing some shockingly Borderlands-yellow chinos. You can watch for yourselves below. Skip to about five minutes from before the end if you‚Äôre just interested in the Tales From The Borderlands announcement.

I think your reaction to the idea of someone asking you that will predict your response to Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between, a self-described &quot;surreal journey through the spaces between places&quot;. Do you think &quot;what have you been doing to give your life meaning?&quot; is a cool way to start a conversation? A better prompt than you&#x27;d normally encounter? A big question, rather than small talk? Then you will probably be more open to the delights of Glitchhikers, a game where where you talk about choice and predetermination to what appears to be sentient windchimes while driving along a one-way motorway. Where you take a nighttime walk around a park peopled with meditating animals who have opinions about magic.

Larian‚Äôs CEO Swen Vincke didn‚Äôt make his usual armoured appearance for the announcement, unless you count his legs poking out from behind a desk. Get well soon, Swen. Larian have styled the release date announcement as a look back at Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3‚Äôs ‚Äújourney so far‚Äù while it‚Äôs been in early access. It‚Äôs a bit daft, but neatly summarises how the game has evolved over the past two years.

In the latter category, first prize definitely goes to the trio of highly cursed doll babies scattered around the stand for Chernobylite, the post-apocalyptic survival horror roguelite that came out last year. They were also accompanied by two gas masks, casually strewn across the corners of TV screens, but nothing compared to the truly haunted look of these semi-melted plastic husks.

                              <span>Hullo chaps! Yes, it&#x27;s another US processor deal, as there have been quite a few good ones recently. The 12700K is my personal pick of the new Intel 12th-gen family, as it offers the same number of performance cores and therefore much the same performance as the flagship 12900K - all while producing far less heat and costing much less too. It normally retails for around $385, but today a $45 discount code on Newegg brings it to just $340. 

Get the Intel Core i7 12700K for $340 with code SSBR2323 ($45 off)

                              <span>The Ryzen 9 5950X is a magnificent CPU that manages to deliver top-tier gaming performance while having enough cores (16) and threads (32) to be an incredibly strong workstation too - and now it&#x27;s on sale. 
CCL in the UK are offering it for ¬£516 for the CPU alone, but you can also combine a discount code and CCL&#x27;s bundling mechanism to get an even better deal on the 5950X and a Corsair 850W power supply - the ultimate starting point for a content creation workstation that also doubles as a high-end gaming PC.

                              <span>The Motion Picture Association (MPA) would like stricter identity checks to become part of a new trade agreement between the U.S. and the Indo-Pacific region. These new obligations should apply to hosting companies and other online services. In addition, the movie industry group would like enforcement tools and procedures to apply equally offline and on the Internet.

Police executed 13 search and seizure warrants against three TV piracy sites, two illegal streaming portals, and an IPTV provider. Three people were arrested with one suspect, an accountant, apparently caught &#x27;red-handed&#x27; while streaming from his office.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea, it was impossible to build it anywhere else. Or so Andrew Ryan claimed.

Plus, there&#x27;s a new three month free trial available if you&#x27;ve bought certain recent Microsoft games.

The culprit can be found among the &quot;related topics&quot; list at the bottom, which includes Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4.

The relentless PR campaign in favour of feudal obligation continues in the next Stellaris expansion, Overlord, which will add new &quot;vassalization mechanics&quot; when it launches on May 12th.

Brendy&#x27;s Tunic review (oh, and sorry Brendy) goes into why the game is an isometric treat. But there&#x27;s another thing I&#x27;d like to highlight: the music. It&#x27;s a magnificent work companion or study aid or meditative ascent to nirvana enabler.

                              <span>A Spanish man who operated five pirate sites, offering a wide variety of content, has received a two-year prison sentence from a Madrid court. At trial, the parties agreed to suspend the sentence on the condition that he pays ‚Ç¨500,000 in damages and stays out of trouble. The accusations against the man&#x27;s mother were also withdrawn as a result.

                              <span>Several Hollywood studios and Netflix have prevailed in their battle to shut down pirate streaming site PrimeWire. Despite PrimeWire recently removing all links to pirated movies and TV shows and losing more than 60% of its traffic in a month, a US court found the streaming site liable for copyright infringement. PrimeWire&#x27;s domains will now be seized.

                              <span>For the first time ever, Netflix has reported a drop in subscriber numbers. The streaming giant lost over 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter of the year and expects to lose two million more in the next quarter. While this drop isn&#x27;t blamed on piracy, illegal downloading and streaming pose a serious concern in the competitive streaming business.
