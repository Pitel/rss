                              <span>As you&#x27;re undoubtedly aware if you play Destiny 2, a minor controversy has been afoot over the past couple of weeks. The Weightgate, as it&#x27;s come to be known, suggests that there have been some serious RNG Perk weighting problems that Bungie&#x27;s been overlooking, but the fix is coming soon.


More specifically, Bungie has not only acknowledged that something&#x27;s up with the way certain Legendary weapons drop but also promised full-fledged reparations to all players. The fix is dropping on November 5 as part of Hotfix 8.1.0.4, and it&#x27;s a real doozy. Not only should this resolve any and all Perk weighting in the future, but it also comes with a real treat: an assortment of top-tier god roll Legendary weapons that were affected by the RNG problems.

                              <span>It must be a huge weight off the collective shoulders of everyone at Bloober Team to see the remake of Silent Hill 2 is doing pretty well for itself. Steam shows the game as &quot;Overwhelmingly Positive&quot; for all reviews, so it definitely proves the wait was worth it in the end.


As a survival horror game, Silent Hill 2 is dripping with mood, atmosphere, anguish, sorrow, and grotesque denizens. What it&#x27;s not dripping with, however, is a potassium-based snack. This is where Nexus Mods user Stevebg23 comes to the rescue with a mod that changes the pistol James finds into a large banana.

As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, you&#x27;ll also find that the lead pipe – a classic of the original 2001 release, many would say – has also been changed. Now, the player will find themselves beating the snot out of monsters with a giant spoon.


Because of reasons, I guess


The reason for the &quot;Banana Gun and Spoon Pipe&quot; mod is simple: the creator &quot;always wanted to have a silly mod,&quot; and this is the result. They also reassure us you can reload the skin of the gun, and that the spoon is &quot;shiny and silvery and nice to handle against the hordes of evil coming your way.&quot; Comforting to know.


Despite its seriousness, anyone who&#x27;s played the original Silent Hill 2 knows the developer was not afraid to get a little silly. The infamous dog ending showed a kind of light-hearted irreverence for this drab horror experience that many of us were absolutely not expecting the first time around.


Of course, the game is still the same, even if you do swap out the pistol for a healthy-looking, half-peeled banana. It&#x27;s nice to know James is getting his vitamins while battling the inner demons of his guilty conscience.

                              <span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard might be a single-player experience, but you rarely play alone, and that&#x27;s only possible thanks to your companions.


However, your available number of companions will always be more than your squad size, so you&#x27;ll have to make some critical decisions. While you can shuffle and switch your party members inside the game, it can&#x27;t be done whenever you want. Hence, it&#x27;s crucial to understand how you can change your party composition.


When can you change your party members in Dragon Age: The Veilguard


There are two moments when you can specifically alter your party composition in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It can be done right at the beginning of a fresh quest when you&#x27;re about to leave your Lighthouse. Once you&#x27;ve selected the pursuit and its location, you can access the &quot;Change Party&quot; option. It will show your two existing party members, and you can change any/both of them based on your preferences.


The only exception to this is that some quests have predetermined team members. In some instances, you&#x27;ll lose access to certain members, but that mostly happens in the endgame, so you don&#x27;t have to stress about that in the beginning.

You can also change the composition of your party at Beacons. You&#x27;ll come across beacons while traveling the lands, and they&#x27;re instrumental as they allow you to fast travel. But your fallen teammates will also be available at your beacons, where you can &quot;Gather Your Party.&quot; Not only can you recall all your fallen party members, but you can also shuffle the composition.


Do note that your available companions will gradually increase as you complete more quests in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The main campaign has three different acts, and there is additional content like side quests, Faction quests, and more. All your companions also have their own story arcs, so there&#x27;s plenty to explore and complete.

                              <span>There is a huge variety of different fish available to catch and catalog in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and they all have specific recipes that call for them. One of these fish, the Lancetfish, can be particularly elusive. 


Although you should definitely cook your Lancetfish before consuming them, even some Lancetfish Sushi (not an actual recipe in DDLV) will net you 1,300 energy when consumed. Lancetfish is also a particularly lucrative fish to hunt for, with each selling to Goofy for 650 Star Coins. 


As with all fish and items in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you can also use it as a decoration. It takes up a 2x1 area when placed. To put your Lancetfish on display, enter your inventory and drop it, then enter the furniture menu and move it to where you want it.

If you’ve ever managed to get your hands on a once-in-a-game item and then somehow gone on to lose it, whether by accidentally discarding it or through a horrible accident, there’s now a way to get those items back — the Lost Item Shop.

The Lost Item Shop in Stardew Valley isn’t actually a shop, but rather a newly added woodland critter NPC who appears in a specific spot. Judging from this NPCs proclivity for collecting and holding on to shiny trinkets, I think …</span>

                              <span>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is something many fans want as it&#x27;s been a part of the series for decades. Playing against your friends or with them in co-op on the couch is a memory many cherish and would like to resume in 2024 and beyond. 


Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 split-screen-capable with friends?


Thankfully, you can play both the zombies mode and multiplayer with split-screen functionality. There&#x27;s a catch, however. PS4, Xbox One, and PC Call of Duty Black Ops 6 players can&#x27;t use split-screen and are only able to play with one player at all times. Only those on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S can play a round of Team Deathmatch with a mate on the couch with split-screen. Simply connect the second controller and have them press A or the cross button at the lobby.

The positive is that the split-screen covers the entire screen with no cut-off sections. It&#x27;s fully 16:9. It doesn&#x27;t seem like you can play competitively against each other, however. I&#x27;ve tried to start a local multiplayer match under the &quot;Private Match&quot; mode and it didn&#x27;t connect a second controller.


Does Call of Duty Black Ops 6 need to connect online?


Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll need to always be online while playing Call of Duty Black Ops 6, even for the single-player campaign. This means that LAN has become obsolete. At least, some form of Black Ops 6 local multiplayer is supported through split-screen.


Do you need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass to play Call of Duty Black Ops 6 online?


If you&#x27;re playing the game on PS4 and PS5, you&#x27;ll need at least PlayStation Plus Essential to access Call of Duty Black Ops 6&#x27;s multiplayer matchmaking. This is the same with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S users with Xbox Game Pass Core and up. Thankfully, both of these services come with free games each month. November 2024, for example, has Ghostwire Tokyo and Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 included with your subscription.

The Pomegranate, for example, may seem like a common fruit to have in your inventory, but it’s actually incredibly useful. It’s also not as easy to get as you&#x27;d think. So here&#x27;s how to get a Pomegranate in The Sims 4.


How to graft a Pomegranate in The Sims 4


The easiest way to get a Pomegranate is simply to buy one from your Sim&#x27;s phone under gifts, and choose gardening for the category. However, you can also graft one using an Apple and a Cherry. You’ll need to be at least level five in the Gardening skill to graft, so have your Sim reach this level firs…</span>

17. Mass Effect: Andromeda


We all know this couldn&#x27;t be anywhere else. While I don&#x27;t doubt Andromeda looked good on paper, at some point, at least, the end result felt no better than an actual paper cut.

Throw some romance into the mix, especially angsty, will-they-won’t-they relationships between two people who seem indescribably wrong for each other, and you’ve got a recipe for a hit book. Of course, there are other things that matter, like the writing style and the actual story, but romance and mystery are a classic combo.

With the release of Nintendo&#x27;s financial report for Q2 FY2025, we have updated sales figures for some of the year&#x27;s biggest Switch titles. And what do you know, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has hit a pretty impressive milestone.
At the latest count (up to September 2024), the Switch remake has pulled in 1.94 million sales since its release in May. It&#x27;s a decent number (if not a particularly high one by Nintendo&#x27;s standards), but what makes this figure so special is that it&#x27;s higher than TTYD&#x27;s lifetime sales on GameCube — which sales-tracking website VGChartz puts at 1.91 million. Yes, after just four months, the remake has outsold the original.

Blimey, has it already been three months since the last lot?
Yes, it&#x27;s time for another round of Nintendo financial results, and we can soon expect the usual investor Q&amp;A with Shuntaro Furukawa and co. deflecting questions about the Switch &quot;successor&quot; and then explaining how the Nintendo Music app is one example of the company&#x27;s continued efforts to increase the value of NSO, and that the Nintendo Museum is helping spread awareness of its IP, and that the expansion of the theme parks and upcoming movie plans... yadda yadda, etc. etc.

A stolen Pokémon card supposedly worth up to £30,000 has been safely returned to its rightful owner/trainer.
As reported by the BBC, police have stated that the theft of a Charizard card took place in Heathfield in East Sussex between 2nd and 5th September 2024. The same card was then found to have been listed for sale on Facebook, leading to a search order being completed on an address in Polegate, roughly 11-12 miles away from the original location.

The latest UK charts are in and after putting up an admirable performance in its debut week, Sonic X Shadow Generations appears to be struggling over a long distance.
The blue blur&#x27;s latest adventure has slipped out of the top ten this week, winding up in 13th while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and EA Sports FC 25 both cling onto the gold and silver. Dragon Age: The Veilguard debuts in third, but it&#x27;s a slightly quiet one on the Nintendo front.

Nintendo has announced that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has sold a total of 2.58 million units since its release on 26th September 2024.
Now, officially, the financial data covers the first six-month period of FY2025 ending on September 30th 2024. Nintendo has played a bit fast and loose when it comes to announcing sales for new titles, so it&#x27;s not known at this time whether the figures for Echoes of Wisdom just cover the six days between its release and the end of the six-month period, or if Nintendo has simply pulled the most recent data available.

                              <span>So expect it before the end of March 2025.
As expected, Nintendo did mention the upcoming Switch successor as part of its latest financial release, but reiterated that its plans around the eventual announcement have not changed.
As covered by Reuters, president Shuntaro Furukawa stated during an online press conference that there will be no change to Nintendo&#x27;s current plan to announce the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; by the end of the financial year (March 2025). In other words, then, if you thought the Switch&#x27;s diminishing sales would spur the company on to reveal its successor, then you might want to temper your expectations.

Nintendo has released its latest financial data covering the first six-month period for FY2025 and, as part of that, it has updated the top ten best-selling games list once more.
The only major change we can see with this one is that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has usurped Super Mario Party to claim the eighth position. We&#x27;d also predicted a similar shift with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Pokémon Sword and Shield, but alas, it seems as though both Pokémon generations are selling at a fairly similar rate at the moment (with Scarlet and Violet enjoying slightly higher sales), leading to a bit of a stalemate.

Nintendo has released its financial data for the six-month period of FY2025 Q1/Q2 and, as per the norm, has reconfirmed its upcoming line-up of software for the Nintendo Switch.
Truth be told, it&#x27;s not a bad list of titles considering the console&#x27;s age. If Nintendo had shown us this a couple of years back, we&#x27;d collectively nod our heads in appreciation. Still, there&#x27;s no doubt in our minds that the recent reveal of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has bolstered what would have otherwise been a fairly slim line-up.

Nintendo has released its six-month financial data for FY2025 Q1/Q2, revealing that the Switch family of systems has now topped a whopping 146.04 million units. The downside of this is that the console&#x27;s momentum has undoubtedly slowed down, selling just 2.64 million more than the 143.42 reported in August this year (which, to be fair, is still pretty decent for a console of its age).
The decrease year-on-year is a rather startling 31%. As such, Nintendo has revised its hardware forecast for the remainder of the financial year, decreasing previous estimates by 1 million to land at 12.5 million.

Nintendo&#x27;s latest entry in the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series arrives exclusively on the Switch this week and critic reviews are now rolling in.
If you haven&#x27;t already seen our review of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership here on Nintendo Life, our reviewer PJ O&#x27;Reilly gave the game an &quot;excellent&quot; 9 out of 10 stars - mentioning how this latest entry takes the long-running series to &quot;new heights&quot;.

November is slowing things down a bit, but it’s not quite backlog month just yet. A new Mario &amp; Luigi, Flight Simulator, and Lego game headline a month of stuff…

                              <span>I have zero archaeology experience or knowledge, but I bet archaeologists really love their jobs (for the most part). They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That&#x27;s dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it&#x27;s like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn&#x27;t have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I&#x27;d like more of it, please.

                              <span>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

                              <span>Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn&#x27;s dead-eyed appraisal that it&#x27;s &quot;a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don&#x27;t like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.&quot; I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he&#x27;d encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6&#x27;s developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that &quot;Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.&quot; The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you&#x27;ve had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

                              <span>Since the launch of BO6, the Sniper Rifle class seems to have gotten the short end of the stick. The gun&#x27;s slow movement speed makes it almost impossible to use in Multiplayer&#x27;s fast-paced rounds, where Assault Rifles, SMGs, and Shotguns take point.


If you want to make this weapon class more accessible, we&#x27;re here to show you how to get Sniper Headshots easily in Black Ops 6.

                              <span>The Mario &amp; Luigi series wasn’t in the best state following AlphaDream’s closure. The last actually new title was Paper Jam in 2015, followed by two remakes. It was a rough final chapter in the studio’s life.


Paper Jam was the worst reviewed in the series (to be fair, Laura Kate Dale, writing for Destructoid, gave it an 8 out of 10). The second remake, Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story + Bowser Jr.&#x27;s Journey, was the worst-selling to the point where it was a possible contributing factor to Alphadream&#x27;s bankruptcy.


Thankfully, the series lives on with Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. Being one of the successor series to Super Mario RPG with a unique focus on the two title characters, I feel it has a lot of merit. Brothership demonstrates that but falls way short of its potential.

Few things work better in getting fans hyped than a mystery everyone&#x27;s invited to solve. Whereas P.T. challenged everyone to figure out, well, the entirety of P.T., the Silent Hill 2 remake featured a bunch of mysterious pictures that combined to form the game&#x27;s greatest mystery.


These polaroid pictures hid a message for players to uncover, but, for one month — an eternity in the Internet age — nobody was able to figure it out. This one doesn&#x27;t need to keep you awake at night anymore, however, as Dale Robinson has finally managed to crack the code. Spoilers abound!

                              <span>If there was one thing CoD players were calling for action, it has to be the desire to nerf the all-powerful Recon perk. And after much player feedback, the developers have finally answered the call with the new Black Ops 6 patch. 


The Recon Perk has been on everyone&#x27;s radar since BO6&#x27;s release, where users can see enemies through walls after respawn. It also flashes a HUD indicator when someone&#x27;s outside your view, similar to the classic High Alert ability. Although it&#x27;s a convenient feature, some have taken advantage of it by pre-firing toward the opponent&#x27;s direction, making for an easy kill. You can think of it as a spawn trap, creating an unbalanced experience for those without it.

                              <span>Your choice of a display name is one of the most crucial elements of your CoD build, along with weapons and perks. Sometimes, you may want to change this title, whether because of an embarrassing decision you made in your younger days or the desire for a simple refresher.


Whatever your reason, you have the power to change your display name in Black Ops 6. Here&#x27;s how.


How do you change your display name in BO6?


You can change your display name on the Activision website or in-game. To do so in-game, go to Settings and choose &#x27;Account &amp; Network&#x27;. Select &#x27;Activision Account&#x27; to reach the Change Display Name page. Using the Token system, you&#x27;ll only have roughly two chances to alter your display name in BO6.


Screenshot by Destructoid


One Token lets you change your name, requiring you to restart the game after initiating the alteration. You&#x27;ll receive two of these items at the beginning of your Black Ops 6 journey. Then, you&#x27;ll get another Token after every six months. Since this feature is relatively limited, it&#x27;s best to double-check your username to get the right one for you.


You may also change your BO6 display name when logging into your Activision account via PC or mobile. Head to your Profile section and press &#x27;Basic Info&#x27;. Scroll down to Activision ID and change it from there. The Tokens rule still applies here, with a limit of two annual alterations. You&#x27;ll need to verify your email to access specific Activision features like this if you cannot change it.


In some cases, you may receive an automatic requirement to change your display name, as several players have encountered this occurrence. Those who get this prompt likely have an inappropriate title, so they must find a better-suited one. You won&#x27;t be able to access the game otherwise, or Activision may change the title for you.

This guide will walk you through the steps to acquire it, including tips on when and where to buy it, how to trigger the Aurora event, and why you might want to do it in a party. So, without further ado, here is how to get the Aurora Rod in the Fisch Roblox experience.


Where to Find Aurora Rod in Fisch


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can buy Aurora Rod from Synth, an NPC in Vertigo zone. It won&#x27;t come cheap, as you&#x27;ll need 90,000C$ to get it, so be sure to farm for money. Price is not the only thing to worry about, as the Aurora Rod is only available during the Aurora event in Fisch. Once the event is activated, all players on the server can participate in the hunt.

                              <span>Finally, some vampire killers.
Ode to Castlevania is a full-circle moment for Vampire Survivors. Heavily inspired by the franchise, and originally built with assets influenced by Konami’s whip-cracking series, Luca Galante and Poncle have blown all of their other excellent DLC out of the water. If your jaw isn’t on the floor by the time you roll credits, we’ll get back in our coffin.
This is Vampire Survivors&#x27; second collaboration with Konami following the Contra-themed Operation Guns DLC. This time it&#x27;s the same great, roguelike, auto-shooting, time-sucking Vampire Survivors gameplay, but now with a distinct twist to delight Castlevania fans. And while those fans will get the most out of the DLC, it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you&#x27;ve played a Castlevania game before — this DLC is a must-play, in our book.

Stardew Valley&#x27;s long-awaited 1.6 update has landed on Switch, bringing with it a whole new crop of features. Developer ConcernedApe shared the news on Twitter (now known as X) earlier today.
First landing on PC back in March, this has been the longest fans have had to wait for a big update to make the jump from PCs to consoles. But it sounds like the wait has been worth it.

We&#x27;re used to donning our finest party hats when a big birthday rolls around here at Nintendo Life, but today&#x27;s celebration calls for a special piece of talking headwear. No cardboard cone will suffice today. We need something green, something intrusive, something with the spirit of an acclaimed mage trapped inside it... and with a beak on the end.
Only with such a fantastic accessory atop our dome can we properly celebrate this one, because it has somehow been a whopping 20 years since The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap launched in Japan. While we search through our copious hatboxes to try and find such a headpiece, let&#x27;s lay down the facts.

Back in April, the Nintendo Network servers were officially closed down, wrapping up online play for Wii U and 3DS users and the consoles&#x27; respective eShops. A few weeks after the closing date, we posted about four players who were still keeping the dream alive, remaining on the servers thanks to their constant, uninterrupted use of them.
These numbers would dwindle over the ensuing months, with the Wii U&#x27;s online camp emptying completely in July. Just one brave player, @fishguy6564, remained on the 3DS, stuck in an endless loop of Mario Kart 7 online victory laps with nobody to play against. Today, almost seven months exactly since the Nintendo Network shut up shop, fishguy6564 has dropped out of the race (thanks for the heads up, Gaming Reinvented).

With the upcoming Switch launch of Metal Slug Tactics on 5th November 2024, we&#x27;ve caught up with developer Leikir Studio and creative director Aurélien Loos to take a dive into the game&#x27;s visual design, focusing on the team&#x27;s efforts to adapt iconic characters, vehicles, and environments into a new isometric view-point, while working to capture the franchise&#x27;s iconic run &#x27;n&#x27; gun essence.
To start, Loos wanted to make it clear that athough there are certainly some roguelike elements in Metal Slug Tactics, all of the environmental assets were handcrafted. To give a sense of the scale of the project, Loos states &quot;In all, we have 181,511 in-game sprites and 217,701 lines of code, including 158,337 for gameplay only&quot;. It sounds like a mammoth task, then, and it looks like all that work has paid off in terms of the exquisite visuals.

Video game preservation still has a long way to go, but it’s difficult to imagine a re-release of Human Entertainment’s Clock Tower ten, or even five years ago. Yet thanks to rapidly growing interest in retro gaming and the resulting explosion of compilations and re-releases over the last few years, this curious SNES survival horror is now available worldwide in all its glory.
Originally exclusive to Japan, Clock Tower: Rewind presents the original 1995 game along with an enhanced version of the 1997 ‘First Fear’ PS1 port, adding in new scenarios and minor improvements such as the ability to run upstairs (both versions also include a rewind feature). On top of that, you’ve got a bunch of extras to peruse, including interviews with creator Hifumi Kono, motion comics, scans of the Japanese manual and strategy guide, and more. It’s a generous package that goes a long way to compensating for the game’s relatively short two-to-three-hour runtime (multiple endings included).

Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket arrived on mobile last week, and, after racking up an impressive 10 million downloads in its first 48 hours, it has reportedly been pulling in some beefy revenue numbers over the weekend (thanks, VGC).
As reported by MobileGamer.biz, the mobile market research firm AppMagic estimates that TCG Pocket has been bringing in a sweet $3 million per day since launch, racking up $12 million in its first four days on the market.

As the very first Mario &amp; Luigi RPG to be released on a full-fat home console, we&#x27;ve been champing at the bit to discover whether or not Nintendo would capitalise on the extra grunt of the Switch to serve us up the biggest and best turn-based Bros. romp yet in the form of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.
We had some concerns during our preview. As much as we love the new graphical stylings and flashy additions to the series&#x27; core combat, early areas were rather small-scale and not quite as challenging or inventive as we&#x27;d been prepping for.

It has been a little over eight years since we got our first official look at the Switch. Eight years since we first saw Karen on the rooftop. Eight years since we embraced the thought of playing Skyrim on a plane. Eight years since we wondered why the heck you would take a console on a dog walk.
To mark this anniversary, former Nintendo employees Kit and Krysta have opened up about what went into the making of the now-iconic trailer in the latest episode of their podcast (timestamped above). And yes, it will come as no surprise that there was a certain amount of juicy drama behind the scenes.

To say that Nintendo fans are eager to experience Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Switch would be somewhat of an understatement. It&#x27;s true that the desire for a port of the Wii U RPG has been strong for several years now, but if the debut trailer&#x27;s current viewcount is anything to go by, it seems that excitement for this one is sky-high.
As highlighted by Stealth on social media, the trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has already amassed over one million views, just five days after its reveal. By comparison, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, revealed in September 2019 and released in May 2020, is currently sitting at just over 672,000 views.

Not to mention getting anything done. After calling for the platform&#x27;s suspension and meeting resistance in the wake of the recent Google Drive blocking blunder, AGCOM board member Elisa Giomi has gone public with a laundry list of concerns.

In short, he was going to take the game to space. Righto.

                              <span>Minor spoilers for the first few hours of Veilguard and heavy spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3
For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

                              <span>Twitch have introduced a new &quot;Politics and Sensitive Social Issues&quot; label for streams that &quot;focus&quot; on topics like &quot;elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict&quot;. As with the streaming giant&#x27;s existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can &quot;make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to&quot; - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don&#x27;t want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch&#x27;s hope is that &quot;the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.&quot;

                              <span>It’s tempting to frame Straftat as a throwback to an older, better time for the multiplayer FPS, when the lingo was coded in frags and gibs and sucking it down, when satisfaction was drawn entirely from performance rather than some convoluted, artificial system of progression. Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

                              <span>The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

                              <span>When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement&#x27;s inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you&#x27;re not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you&#x27;ve collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they&#x27;ve answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.

I need to avoid any complicated write-ups, or my brain will detonate similarly and paint north London grey.
Ah, a minigolf game! I think I can just about hack the concept of minigolf, on this most desperate of Mondays. It is golf but mini. Bonzai golf. Digestible! Intuitive! Why, I&#x27;ve managed to write 100 words without even looking at the Steam page. Let&#x27;s do so now. Wait a minute, this isn&#x27;t minigolf. It&#x27;s Mini Mini Golf Golf. What is Mini Mini Golf Golf? &quot;Destabilize the present and plunge into a neon psychohistory of a bizarre entity in distress,&quot; the Steam page explains. &quot;This is not a game about minigolf.&quot; It is too late to flee.

                              <span>I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead&#x27;s body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, &quot;Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!&quot;
No, sadly not. It&#x27;s no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead&#x27;s true, irritating form.

                              <span>I didn’t get much further in the extremely popular beta for the haute-couture-asaurus action of Monster Hunter Wilds than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there&#x27;s a good reason for those misgivings. It&#x27;s all about frames, you see.

                              <span>One of my lesser quality tests for an RPG is whether the shopkeepers complain at you for not buying anything. Grumpy shopkeepers, good RPG. This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.

                              <span>Put your hand up if you&#x27;d forgotten that every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That&#x27;s not the actual distant past you&#x27;re parkouring through. That isn&#x27;t actual Renaissance architecture you&#x27;re clambering on. It&#x27;s a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA&#x27;s fault, not Ubisoft&#x27;s. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that&#x27;s simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin&#x27;s Creed&#x27;s modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3. In Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, however, they&#x27;re planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

                              <span>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn&#x27;t a rail shooter, so you&#x27;ll be typing to explore and navigate, too.

It&#x27;s now got a release of February 2025, and there&#x27;s a demo you can play now.

I&#x27;m expecting some really juicy catch-up comments next weekend! In the meantime, this post will stay up as usual so you can at least hear what we&#x27;re getting up to in the treehouse.
Congratulations on making it to another checkpoint, fellow traveller. Please spend your hard-earned coin on one of the following bonuses: either a weekend of games but no sleep; a weekend of sleep but no games; or a weekend of health and activity but nothing to post in the comments below? Your choice! Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend.

And every single time my brain clunks into gear and I turn inwards, where I struggle to come up with anything meaningful to say. So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it&#x27;s me. I&#x27;m holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip.

                              <span>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie action game Showa American Story is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:

I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

                              <span>The Steam Deck is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users. Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for Apex Legends.

Torrent site YTS was the first target, followed by popular pirate streaming sites SFlix and MyFlixer this week.

                              <span>From developers Cannibal Interactive, the creators of Purgatory Dungeoneer, springs forth a new labyrinth game. This one is called Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don&#x27;t just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who&#x27;ll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander. Personally, it&#x27;s not the vibe I&#x27;m after when I sit down in the evening and I think, &quot;I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant&quot;. But hey, it might be for you.

                              <span>Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of Dragon Age: Veilguard. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet&#x27;s Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’. Here’s a clip:

Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it&#x27;s obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, &#x27;We need to cut something.&#x27; Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They&#x27;re playing a different game.

                              <span>With the AMD EPYC 9005 &quot;Turin&quot; series launch earlier this month there was launch-day benchmark review results for the EPYC 9575F, EPYC 9755, and EPYC 9965 processors in looking at that frequency optimized SKU, the new flagship 128-core Turin &quot;classic&quot; core model, and the new flagship 192-core Turin &quot;dense&quot; core SKU, respectively. That&#x27;s interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 &quot;Genoa&quot; flagship model. Here&#x27;s a look today at how the AMD EPYC 9655 1P/2P 96-core processor compares to the prior EPYC 9654 flagship.</span>

                              <span>The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment says it has shut down Livehd7, a pirate site network providing free streams of Premier League, Serie A, and LaLiga matches. With over a quarter billion visits in the last 12 months alone, Livehd7 is a significant operation, but  news of its demise may provoke déjà vu. In September 2023, ACE said that in collaboration with Egypt&#x27;s Ministry of Justice, the operator of Livehd7 had been arrested, and the network shut down.

                              <span>Technology infrastructure companies including Amazon, Google, and Cloudflare, are warning the U.S. Government about the downsides of foreign piracy blocking measures. The coalition argues that anti-piracy initiatives, including those in France and Italy, disrupt international trade, increase costs for U.S. companies, and could lead to unintended censorship.

                              <span>One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It&#x27;s a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

                              <span>I never completed the original Red Dead Redemption, but not for the usual reasons of being terrible at the game, or thinking that open worlds are too big and boring these days and I just want to lie down forever and watch anime. I never finished it because my Xbox 360 version was not, in practice, an open world game, but a lonely farm at the bottom of a vortex of butchered spacetime. In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

                              <span>Classic god sims like Populous and Black &amp; White teach that deities love to reach their horrible holy hands into our world and mess with us directly. They teach us to see 1-1 divine intervention in every random house fire and every lightning bolt that miraculously strikes our enemies. By contrast, the forthcoming Zero Orders Tactics teaches that god prefers to operate via covert means, because after all, personally lobbing some electricity at somebody would be inelegant. It&#x27;s far more graceful to trap them behind a mountain, instead.

Now, in an entirely predictable case of &quot;I am once again asking our tech overlords to watch the whole movie&quot;, those plucky chancers at Ubisoft have lifted AliceO’s ideas wholesale, ignored her timely and cogent commentary, and released a roiling puke reservoir of NFT upchuck masquerading as a game. Thank you Ian Games for the spot. You are the Neal Stephenson to AliceO’s William Gibson, but for worthless crap. (The IGN piece has some very good context and is worth reading).

                              <span>The line between escapist entertainment and Problematic fantasy can be thin, but I think Indiana Jones&#x27;s dislike for the German National Socialist Party of the 1930s and 1940s is fairly clearcut. &quot;Nazis - I hate these guys!&quot; he says in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Let&#x27;s play Devil&#x27;s Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: &quot;Nazis? I hate these guys!&quot; [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I&#x27;m not really feeling it.
I guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler&#x27;s autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he&#x27;s such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it&#x27;s amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game&#x27;s depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.

                              <span>Sony have shut down Firewalk Studios, the developers behind ill-fated multiplayer hero shooter Concord, and confirmed that the game will not be returning to stores. In doing so, they are effectively striking a line through a big, red $200 million in their books - a number that some report is only part of the loss.

                              <span>PUBG Corporation and Krafton have just gone and announced Project Arc, a top-down 5v5 shooter &quot;inspired by PUBG&quot;. To be honest with you, it looks more inspired by Rainbow Six Siege with what looks to be one team aiming to hack a crypt by breaking down defences, while the other reinforces structures to prevent them from doing that. There&#x27;s also a big emphasis on sightlines, too, where gaining or robbing an enemy team&#x27;s vision is crucial to blatting them in the head with lead. It looks interesting! If a difficult sell, given the fact it&#x27;s yet another 5vs5 shooter…

                              <span>If I am ever murdered, please do not ask Max Caulfield to investigate. I&#x27;ve already written our review for Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, in which I celebrated the touching moments of Max&#x27;s return to the series, and lamented the clunky plot that she finds herself in. In this adventure game, you&#x27;re looking into the killing of a close friend, shot by an unknown assailant. You hop between two dimensions to solve the case - one world in which your pal still lives and the other in which she&#x27;s dead. Unfortunately for the murder victim, you play a bona fide hot mess who could not perform a cross examination if she were standing in front of a crucifix with a magnifying glass.

                              <span>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like Wasteland 3, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games. Sin very nearly liked Stasis: Bone Totem, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with Beautiful Desolation - an isometric RPG I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror FPS Animal Use Protocol, they both featured considerably less monke.

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

                              <span>Going by three hours with a preview build last month, the Indiana Jones of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle has the hungriest hands this side of Thief 2014. They&#x27;re always surging into view, reaching restlessly toward objects as you explore, for there is ever so much to touch: photos and letters; pipes, frying pans, and other blunt implements; relics that translate into &quot;Adventure Points&quot;, used to &quot;unlock&quot; books of skills; camouflaged levers and other chunks of fusty comicbook exotica that harbour clockwork secrets. Sometimes, Indy&#x27;s magic fingers help you glean an object you need from the game&#x27;s religiously-sourced piles of Lucasfilm memorabilia. Sometimes, they exhaust you: please, Dr Jones, for the love of George. Stop trying to pick things up. Let me look at &quot;ancient history&quot; for a while.

                              <span>I missed my chance to write about Hollywood Animal when a certain Nic Reuben swooped in like a rival showbiz talent scout and pinched the summer Steam Fest demo from right under my nose, capitalising on the fact that I was stranded in an airport at the time. I wrote about a very rude Minesweeper &quot;homage&quot; instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 


Anyway, it&#x27;s finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they&#x27;ve also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

They&#x27;re being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who claim that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff &quot;with serious medical conditions and doctor&#x27;s recommendations to work from home&quot;.

                              <span>Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they announced in 2023. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there&#x27;s still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.

The developers of Monster Hunter Wilds are including an option in the upcoming beast-skinning action RPG that will turn all arachnid style monsters into something much less creepy and/or crawly.

                              <span>Japan-based publishing giant Shueisha has asked a court in the United States to issue an order that requires Google, VISA &amp; PayPal to provide information on several pirate site operators. Shueisha&#x27;s goal is to obtain enough information on these currently anonymous individuals so that it can file lawsuits against them in Japan. A DMCA subpoena obtained earlier against Cloudflare appears to have provided plenty of fresh leads.

More recently, however, there&#x27;s been some excitement around a seemingly new type of leak, tagged &quot;Theater&quot;. Are these high quality copies ripped from DCPs, or is something else going on?

More quietly behind the scenes, however, the declared supporters list has been expanding with the BBC, DAZN, NBCUniversal, and the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, among others.

                              <span>What Remains Of Edith Finch is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It&#x27;s also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you&#x27;re a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you&#x27;re beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer&#x27;s next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It&#x27;s another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying &quot;the strangeness of organic life&quot;. Also, chicken-legged houses.

That is because cats will not stoop to such frivolities, where it can be reasonably avoided. Cats are too self-respecting to get caught up in silly online multiplayer party games. Please. Don&#x27;t insult their intelligence, their divinity, their mastery of the environment and of your emotions. Cats don&#x27;t need 2-9 player scrambles across the rooms of an eccentric manor house, with customisable outfits and various minigames. What? Jumping Jazz Cats? No. I won&#x27;t recognise it. This is a work of impossible sedition. Impossible, cute sedition. Pay no attention to the trailer below.

                              <span>It’s always nice to say that a big, look-how-much-we-spent-on-pore-rendering AAA game actually runs quite well on PC, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does. Unfortunately for Bl6ps, and for us, that technical success is balanced on the knife tip of some seriously overwrought infrastructure. Mainly in the form the UX nightmare that is the Call of Duty HQ launcher, as well as a meddlesome always-online requirement, itself serving a feature that doesn’t even work that well.

                              <span>You can feel two ways about something at the same time. The feuding academics of Life Is Strange: Double Exposure might call this &quot;emotional superposition&quot;. But the word &quot;ambivalent&quot; already exists. So let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I&#x27;ve been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it&#x27;s over, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery.

                              <span>If there’s one thing I’d like to get across about my time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard - perhaps a surprise given Bioware’s recent history, Anthem, and some of the early marketing for this game - it’s that in my 50 hour return to Thedas, I very rarely felt I was playing something cynical.

                              <span>In case you don&#x27;t know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld&#x27;s rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus&#x27;s emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice&#x27;s soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they&#x27;re both on the surface.
Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn&#x27;t resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother&#x27;s soul out of hell.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve often thought lighthouse keeping would make a fine second career, albeit mostly because in my head, it would give me endless time to write (and finish Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3). You won&#x27;t have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it&#x27;s your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. 
Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it&#x27;s less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There&#x27;s a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. &quot;It&#x27;s consuming my team!&quot; screams a self-described ship captain. &quot;Please, send help! Gosh...&quot; Look, &quot;friend&quot;, no genuine human being says &quot;gosh&quot; in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say &quot;gosh&quot; in an emergency situation. That&#x27;s what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.

Pah. A skill issue if I ever saw one, honestly. Decade is a fascinating adventure game that drew me in with its apparent vagueness but then, like some sort of considerate, sensible coward, went on to explain itself well in on its Steam page.
It’s the end of the world, and you’re not too happy about it, so you’ll be shoving children in a time machine with little more than a rotting Lunchly and some instructions to help you figure out exactly what went wrong.

                              <span>Back in April, I wrote about a hearing that took place between representatives Video Game History Foundation, the Rhizome project, and the Software Preservation Network, in which they argued the case for a DMCA exemption that would allow researchers to remotely access out-of-print games in libraries and archives. Representatives from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the AACS were in opposition, with ESA legal representative Steve Englund at one point fretting about some sort of hellish &quot;online arcade that (he’d) been warning about for the last several proceedings&quot;.
Last Friday, as per a statement released by the VGHF and spotted by PC Gamer, the US Copyright Office officially denied the exemption.

Even when I&#x27;m writing about happy, upbeat games, I&#x27;m actually writing about horror games. I&#x27;m worried that if I double-down further on morbidity I might foul the Maw&#x27;s humours and give it jaundice. So let&#x27;s see if we can satiate the creature with some nice, breezy open worlders and RPGs instead. I&#x27;ll throw in a single horror game just to keep up appearances.

The PC version has a bunch of graphical upgrades and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.

                              <span>Early this year, a court in the UK handed Paul Merrell a 12-month prison sentence for reselling pirate IPTV subscriptions.

A document detailing Merrell&#x27;s failed appeal recently came to light, shining new light on his unusual case.

                              <span>The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a &quot;castle built of bitter memories&quot; by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way &quot;through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps&quot;.
When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.

                              <span>Rock Paper Shotgun has a fuzzy conception of &quot;news&quot;, in that we regard the &quot;new&quot; element of news as overrated, more of a guideline than an obligation. The trick to selling this mindset is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. &quot;It&#x27;s news to me,&quot; I sternly insist, while announcing a game you might pedantically observe was announced in 2019. &quot;I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it,&quot; I declare, writing about my discovery that Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 requires a permanent internet connection, even when you&#x27;re playing the campaign.

                              <span>Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked 10 Dead Doves when she wrote about it back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror. I have been pigeonholed.

                              <span>Look up major events in 2011 and there&#x27;s some world-changing stuff... and some not so world-changing stuff. Shadows Of The Damned&#x27;s Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It&#x27;s a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes&#x27; Suda51 and Resident Evil&#x27;s Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it&#x27;s considered a bit of a cult classic.
So, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it&#x27;s any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there&#x27;s no doubt you&#x27;ll like it. If you&#x27;re coming in as a newbie, I think it&#x27;s refreshing in the sense it&#x27;s a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn&#x27;t only a product of its time - it&#x27;s actually downright yucky.

                              <span>Real ones know that the only XCOM spin off worth its salt is Hasbro’s 1999 play-by-mail banger First Alien Invasion, although that didn’t stop System Shock 2 studio Irrational from getting to work on an FPS set in the strategy series’ universe after being acquired by 2K in 2006. If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project. Kaiju ambitious.

                              <span>With almost no legal access to popular Western movies, Russian cinemas have been selling tickets to short local movies to disguise the unlicensed screening of major Hollywood movies shown during the same sitting. Depending on the direction of the wind, Moscow turns a blind eye or warns of a crackdown on pre-screening piracy, including one expected anytime now. In parallel, legal streaming platforms are enjoying huge growth as business booms.

                              <span>Unrest is a roleplaying game developed by Pyrodactyl Studios set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India. You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.
We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM.

Perhaps you like that monkey on your back. For you, there&#x27;s a new free update, which adds a second set of themed card art to the game inspired by the games Binding Of Isaac, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Slay The Spire.

                              <span>Windblown looks rad. It&#x27;s an action-roguelite for 1-3 players in which you dash-and-slash in rapid combat on floating islands, and I am extremely interested in feeling its game-feel for myself. Good news! I can get my game-feelers on it now because it&#x27;s out in Early Access today.

If you watch its launch trailer below out of context however, you might be fooled into thinking it&#x27;s actually the emo second half of an Isekai anime series.

He&#x27;s got assault rifles and comparison screenshots poking out of his ribcage, which are making an absolute mess of the hallway plaster. He says he is Call Of Duty Man, and he is here to let me know about Black Ops 6&#x27;s day one patch. The new Activision FPS is out tomorrow 25th October, I gather. Call Of Duty Man speaks only in three-syllable bursts and rolling bombardments, but I think if I listen carefully I can make out the highlights. Here&#x27;s what that patch involves, in nickel-plated bulletpoint form.

                              <span>Zotac are one of the better graphics card makers of the post-EVGA era, so even as the early pangs of handheld gaming PC fatigue start to creep in, I’ve been keeping a hopeful eye on the Zotac Zone. This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.
Much like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.

                              <span>New Polish studio From Chaos consist of former members of Witcher developers CD Projekt Red, Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios and 4X household Paradox Interactive, led by erstwhile Gwent programmer Tomek Dietrich - so it&#x27;s no huge surprise that their debut game, Liegecraft, is a big beardy historical strategy RPG.
It&#x27;s a hex and turn-based experience in which you play a dinky little despot running around a medieval world building castles, taking vassals, mustering armies, and going on quests that involve branching dialogue. It&#x27;s got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>Ubisoft Montpellier&#x27;s Beyond Good And Evil 2 has been delayed so much that it has transcended the label of &quot;vapourware&quot;, while staunchly refusing to become &quot;abandonware&quot;. Announced in 2008, it has now comfortably outstripped Duke Nukem Forever as the &quot;triple-A&quot; game with the longest development time. I&#x27;m sure there are a few indie passion projects that have been bubbling away in the shadows for longer, but nothing on this scale. What&#x27;s less tangible than vapour? Ectoplasm? The promises of small children?

                              <span>The developers of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have released an update to the third-person shooter that reverts a lot of tough difficulty changes made in a previous patch. Turns out upping the spawn rate of the vicious Tyrannid baddies across all difficulty modes was not welcome among the meathead murder boys of the Imperium. And this change wasn&#x27;t the only one that caused enough ructions to justify hasty recalibrations from Saber Interactive.

                              <span>In order to make Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 enjoyable, Saber Interactive had to make the Space Marines less like Space Marines. That&#x27;s to say, less like &quot;semi-lobotomized, hypnotically indoctrinated slave-soldiers in thrall to an uncaring (and possibly non-existent) god&quot;, in the words of Rick Priestley, primary writer for the original Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader rulebooks back in the 1980s.

Developed by two-person queer married team resnijars, it looks like a real charmer. All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs. It&#x27;s also out now, which is good for people like me who crave bizzarovanias.

Graphics driver improvements! Third-party SSDs working better! More balanced display colours! No more &quot;spurious power LED blinking&quot;! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.

There’s also some interesting insight regarding design decisions, and the systems CA are hoping to tweak in the future. We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it. Not so much for what it does on its own - more for what its design philosophy represents and could mean for future additions.

                              <span>Authorities in New Zealand recently confirmed that Kim Dotcom will be extradited to the United States to face a criminal prosecution in connection with Megaupload, the file-hosting site he founded. In the United States, the 500 companies and 300,000 members of anti-piracy coalition CreativeFuture, are celebrating already. The extradition &quot;of one of the internet era’s leading jackasses&quot; takes place through the medium of an interactive quiz.

                              <span>I&#x27;d rather command a small troop of ruthless husks to fight my battles than do the dirty work myself - and in the game [Weyyyyyy! -RPS staff]. That&#x27;s reason number one as to why I&#x27;m interested in Skull Horde, an &quot;auto battler dungeon crawler&quot; which casts you as a necromancer in a tiny pixel art world.

Reason number two is that it&#x27;s coming from the developers of the explosively moreish Bore Blasters. Find a teaser trailer below.

The name change is designed to reflect some substantial changes to the game itself - and there&#x27;s a new trailer to show its current condition as a seemingly chill game about tinkering with bikes and riding them around pastel-coloured worlds.

Alas, SI say they&#x27;ve looked into it, and it just isn&#x27;t possible.

                              <span>One of my favourite internet jokes is: &quot;I enjoy video games because they let me live out my wildest fantasies, like being assigned a task and then completing that task&quot;. Wilmot&#x27;s Warehouse felt like that joke made manifest, putting you in the shoes of a tiny warehouse working squareboi. This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn&#x27;t come packaged with its predecessor&#x27;s wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.

                              <span>The Monster Hunter Wilds open beta will launch next week, Capcom have announced. It’ll be live on Steam from 31st October to 3rd November 2024, allowing the more impatient Capcommandoes amongst us to get a taste of the new setting and combat mechanics ahead of the game’s full release in February next year.

                              <span>Velvet 89 is a free hidden object game that tells the story of communist Czechoslovakia&#x27;s &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; in 1989, which brought an end to 41 years of one-party rule and led to the founding of a parliamentary republic. The game released earlier this month, and you can find it on Steam, iOS and Android. I know nothing about the Velvet Revolution, but I do have some quick thoughts on the use of a format I associate with Where&#x27;s Wally to capture a process of extraordinary political change.

It&#x27;s an abbreviated but generous display of equatorial exotica and vaguely prehistoric wildlife, home to such key verbs as &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;village-building&quot;, &quot;gardening&quot;, &quot;creature-nurturing&quot; and &quot;murdering megasloths with a lump of wood&quot;. And look at that, there&#x27;s a release date perched on top - 19th November 2024.

                              <span>Over the past week or so, you may have caught wind of Denuvo  - the makers of anti-cheat and anti-piracy software  - embarking on a PR campaign of sorts, intended to combat negative public perception of their software. In case you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Denuvo&#x27;s wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. 
Denuvo&#x27;s attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. 
RPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered&quot;. What claims are you referring to?
Andreas Ullmann: It&#x27;s basically really about the stuff that&#x27;s posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don&#x27;t want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.

                              <span>&quot;Move over Hollow Knight,&quot; declared Katharine (RPS in peace) in our Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review, summarising this freshly-honed hunk of POP art as &quot;a deep and challenging Metroid-like with some of the best platforming this side of Moon&#x27;s Ori games.&quot; Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn&#x27;t seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown&#x27;s core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that &quot;most&quot; of the Lost Crown&#x27;s dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.

                              <span>I feel this one largely speaks for itself, honestly. I could theorise on the fictional conceit of bringing packaged creatures to life using a microwave and also, sometimes, a blender, but to do so would be to stare into a gift horse’s abyssal oat hole so intently that…
…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”
Thanks for that.

                              <span>Cox Communications is fighting a writ of certiorari filed by several record labels at the U.S. Supreme Court. The music companies argue that ISPs can be held vicariously liable for pirating subscribers, even when they don&#x27;t directly profit from this activity. Cox argues that this &quot;radical new theory&quot; would make ISPs liable for virtually anything their users do online.

                              <span>Mylně jsem se domníval, že jdu na film o problematice eutanázie. Ale místo toho Toltékové, astrální cestování, život po životě, reinkarnace a Jaroslav Dušek. Hodně podobné jako &quot;Tajemství a smysl života&quot;, ale o něco méně WTF a výrazně kratší. Každopádně velmi fádní a nudné, pokud od začátku nevěříte tomu, co je vám cpáno. (Ilča 20 %)</span>

                              <span>Není to kvalitní film, ale je šílený a není nudný ani rutinní. Je to výpověď o tom, co si Coppola na stará kolena myslí o světě a o filmařině - a taková výpověď mě zajímá. Ale kdyby to přesně stejně natočil 25letý absolvent filmové akademie, měl bych z toho jen legraci a vysmíval bych se jeho neschopnosti. (Ilča 60%)</span>

                              <span>Kdybych teoreticky měl pěti- až osmileté dítě, hrozně bych chtěl, aby se mu tenhle film líbil. Kdyby mu bylo 10 nebo 12 let, už bych mu nepouštěl tohle, ale první Bayovy Transformers. Je to fajn, ale je to opravdu jen a pouze pro děti. A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)</span>
