                              <span>Explore the universe in 4K
The magic and wonder of Outer Wilds gets a nice upgrade for newer console owners today. Outer Wilds and its DLC Echoes of the Eye are out now on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a free upgrade for owners on previous-gen consoles.
The space exploration adventure will run at native 60 FPS on the new hardware, with 4K support. That&#x27;s a whole lot of beautiful space pixels to blast into your eyes.
If you own the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One already, you can upgrade within your respective console family at no cost. Just use your respective digital storefront, either PlayStation or Xbox, to bump it up.
Otherwise, Outer Wilds is currently available for $24.99, with the Echoes of the Eye DLC running $14.99, or $39.99 for a bundled package. It&#x27;s also on Game Pass, as of this writing.

A universe full of wonders
If you haven&#x27;t played Outer Wilds yet, then good heavens, what are you waiting for? This time-looping space exploration game, developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive, is an incomparable experience.
When I was recently thinking about the kinds of stories you can only tell in games, Outer Wilds was one of the first to come to mind. It is warm and sentimental, cold and haunting, and expertly crafts its mysteries and story in the span of one galaxy.

Its DLC expansion, Echoes of the Eye, is even more of the same. I think the base game hit me harder, as I knew what I was getting into once I booted up Echoes. But the trees, lights, and hidden puzzles of that place stick with me.
With the PS5 and Xbox Series upgrade out and free for anyone who&#x27;s already picked the game up, this seems like a great excuse to dive back into Outer Wilds.

                              <span>Still due out in 2023
Thanks to a new Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty dev diary TGS trailer, we have a better look at how Team Ninja is approaching this &quot;masocore&quot; (their words) action game.
Fumihiko Yasuda (producer) speaks on how when he was pondering the future of the Nioh series, he &quot;started to consider a worldview separate from Sengoku-era Japan,&quot; and drew upon his personal love of the stories of the Three Kingdoms era. A story &quot;based around Chinese martial arts&quot; was a good fit to convey this idea, and was a perfect way to differentiate a new project from Nioh.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will portray the &quot;turbulence&quot; of the era, with a heavy focus on the concept of the &quot;dark world,&quot; which will likely aim for a baseline intense experience. The &quot;fluidity of speed&quot; is a goal for the combat system, and we get to see a brief look at the upcoming character creation menu. Variation between players in an online setting was used as one reason for avatar customization, as well as a focus on a &quot;historical story,&quot; rather than a personal one.
Team Ninja is busy, as they also have Rise of the Ronin in the works, which also has Yasuda involved as a director (though we&#x27;ll have to understandably wait until 2024 for that one). As someone who watched Team Ninja walk, then run, then falter, I&#x27;m just glad they&#x27;re back in the mix again.
At this point with several recent universally-liked projects under their belt, new announcements are met with glee rather than a groan. There was a rough patch there capped off by Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, but they really counterbalanced that with Hyrule Warriors that same year, into reestablishing dominance with Nioh three years later.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve got until September 21
As we inch closer and closer to the looming 1.0 launch of Vampire Survivors, fans are getting antsy, myself included. Today&#x27;s morsel is just a &quot;minor patch,&quot; but there&#x27;s important news for folks on the sidelines: a price increase is coming soon.
At just three dollars, Vampire Survivors is some of the best bang-for-your-buck gaming I&#x27;ve ever experienced. And while typically Early Access titles wait until their full launch to raise prices, in this case, the game will cost more starting on September 21. The 1.0 launch is coming later — we&#x27;ll learn the full release date in two weeks, on September 29.
The creator, poncle, explained this choice. &quot;To be frank, it&#x27;s because otherwise I&#x27;d mess up the sales calendar for the rest of the year. I want to keep the option open to eventually enter some of the usual seasonal sales, and increasing the price on v1.0 launch day would mess up the timings, as price changes also comes with a temporary price freeze.&quot;
Players have become so absorbed with the game&#x27;s monster-exploding grind and fun unlockables that they&#x27;ve actually asked — sometimes jokingly, but often for real — for Vampire Survivors to charge more. I got my money&#x27;s worth early on, and the updates just kept coming. I&#x27;m now at 55 hours on the clock. It&#x27;s baffling when I stop and think about it.
Today&#x27;s patch is a minor one
So, what&#x27;s new in patch 0.11.3? Most notably, I&#x27;d point to Blood Astronomia (Arcana XXI), which emits &quot;special damaging zones affected by Amount and Magnet&quot; for weapons like Garlic and Song of Mana. There&#x27;s also the MissingNo character, who has randomized stats and can now be &quot;unlocked officially&quot; — find the full instructions here on Reddit.
If you&#x27;ve thought about getting into Vampire Survivors, consider this your call to do so before the price jumps. I can easily see it hitting the $10-$15 range.

                              <span>The Corsair iCUE 5000X is the Californian company&#x27;s best mid-size computer case, thanks to its clean tempered glass design, excellent cooling support and a range of features that make it easy to build in. The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it&#x27;s down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you&#x27;ll have to move fast to pick this one up...

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I&#x27;m able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren&#x27;t eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don&#x27;t actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

That&#x27;s an excellent price for a well-reviewed unit with 80+ Platinum efficiency and a fully modular design - not to mention a surprisingly compact ATX design that will work in a wide range of PC cases.

That’s the message from dev Toby Fox, who’s posted an update on how Deltarune’s coming along. Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale. It shares some new screens, GIFs, a video and even some tunes.

                              <span>Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn&#x27;t been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn&#x27;t ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn&#x27;t a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you&#x27;ll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won&#x27;t succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

                              <span>Epicly long action RPG Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is leaping onto Microsoft’s PC Game Pass subscription service today. The move was announced by surprise during this morning’s ID@Xbox stream at Tokyo Game Show, which I guess is appropriate for something to do with assassins. Odyssey’s predecessor Assassin’s Creed Origins was already plonked on to Microsoft’s subscription service in June this year.

September 29th is the date you’ll want to mark in your runic calendars, which I assume are constructed out of some variety of standing stone formation. The date was announced during last night’s ID@Xbox stream.

                              <span>The wait is finally over
This has been a pretty awesome year for indie games, with titles like Cult of the Lamb, Immortality, and We Are OFK, just to name a few. One game has stuck with me since I reviewed it all the way back in March, and still remains one of my favorites to come out in 2022: the Southern Gothic narrative adventure NORCO that was &quot;inspired by first-person pixel noirs like Déjà Vu &amp; Snatcher and rooted in years of research,&quot; according to the game&#x27;s creators. Set in a dystopian cyberpunk version of New Orleans, Louisiana, the game takes you on a journey through the infamous &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; an area of Mississippi that accounts for a quarter of the US&#x27;s petrochemical production.
Now, the game&#x27;s developer Geography of Robots has announced that NORCO is finally coming to consoles with a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One release on October 20. You can also play on Xbox Games Pass, if that suits your fancy. I obviously own NORCO on PC already, but I&#x27;m super excited for this release, because it means the game will be accessible to more players — and this game deserves all the hype it can get, if getting hype for old-school point-and-clicks is your thing.

A press release from publisher Raw Fury provides more in-depth details on the game:
&quot;NORCO is the debut title from developer collective Geography of Robots. Lead creator Yuts was born and raised in Norco, Louisiana, an acronym for New Orleans Refining Co., located in the so-called &#x27;Cancer Alley,&#x27; a stretch of the Mississippi that accounts for 1/4 of the US&#x27;s petrochemical production. The game blends real locations, personal stories, and Southern Gothic literature with a captivating original soundtrack featuring a guest track by Southern metal Band THOU.&quot;
If you&#x27;re at all interested in checking NORCO out on your favorite console, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!

One of the many things I love about the Zelda series is that each game has its own unique vibe — from the cartoony wholesomeness of Wind Waker to the downright spooky atmosphere of Majora’s Mask. Of course, I’m excited to see how the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, which we now know is called Tears of the Kingdom, will innovate on the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor, but even moreso, I’m pumped to see how the story of the world has changed since we last checked in with the Hylian hero.
When people ask me what my favorite video game stories are, they’re usually confused to hear that I add Breath of the Wild to that list. The game has minimal storytelling aside from the optional memories you can go around and find. What I think it does …</span>

Blizzard is stepping in to clarify exactly how battle pass unlocks will work for the heroes of Overwatch 2.
After leaks of its model for the upcoming free-to-play multiplayer evolution of Overwatch got out, the studio is now detailing exactly how players will unlock heroes in the new game.
Overwatch 2 heads into free-to-play multiplayer on October 4. And as the game shifts into a seasonal content model, hero unlocks will also be part of the Battle Pass.
Loot boxes are going away, being replaced by an in-game shop and a virtual currency, Overwatch Coins. The shop will offer &quot;featured cosmetic items every week&quot; for all players. Season one will follow a cyberpunk theme, and other seasons will have their own themes as well.

Following its PS4 launch, the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection PC release finally has a date straight from Sony: October 19. To re-summarize, Legacy of Thieves is a double-pack of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, with just the single player portions intact.
As detailed in a PlayStation Blog entry, Naughty Dog has partnered with Iron Galaxy for this port, which will feature &quot;a reimagined UI, scale sliders, GPU and VRAM detection, Variable Load Speed, and so much more.&quot; DualSense controller and AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2 support are in too.
When it launches on PC, it&#x27;ll be available on both the Steam and Epic marketplaces for $49.99. On the latter, it&#x27;ll come with a Fortnite: &quot;If you pre-purchase on Epic, you can take your adventure beyond land and sea with Sully’s &#x27;New&#x27; Seaplane, an in-game Glider that you can use in Fortnite.&quot;
Alright then! I guess ignoring a Fornite bonus is going to be a lot easier to do than trying to ignore timed exclusivity.

                              <span>Guest appearances from some series veterans
Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have released the first gameplay trailer for their upcoming remake Like a Dragon: Ishin! — the slick video shows off some of the characters, locales, and intense combat action of the period piece spin-off from the much-loved Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jk_z9hyFY1I&amp;t
Originally released in Japan back in 2014 as Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin!, Sega&#x27;s spin-off sees a suspiciously familiar party of heroes and villains clash against the backdrop of the latter-day Bakamatsu period of Edo-era Japan. Replacing the streets of Kamurocho with rural villages and ancient temples, the game follows the adventures of legendary swordsman and folklore figure Sakamoto Ryōma — essentially &quot;portrayed&quot; by Like a Dragon hero Kazuma Kiryu.
The new remake will feature an overhauled game engine, modern visuals, and tightened combat. In addition, a new &quot;soldier&quot; system will let the player call upon classic Like a Dragon characters for an assist in battle, including Like a Dragon 2&#x27;s Kaoru Sayama and Like a Dragon 7&#x27;s Ichiban Kasuga. As depicted in the trailer, fans can also expect a wide variety of dopey side activities, including some garden plantation, fishing, gambling, and, naturally, some Edo-era karaoke. Because why hot?
It might have been a very, very, very long time coming for western fans, but it looks like this new edition of the rare release is going to have been worth the wait. Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms February 21, 2023.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s the most recent roadmap
Fresh off of launching The Pitt, Bethesda has reconfirmed the Fallout 76 December update timing in a new blog.
First, the team will celebrate the Fallout 25th anniversary starting on October 4. Those festivities will ring in bonus weekends (double mutations and caps-a-plenty), and the From Beyond/Halloween-themed Spooky Scorched seasonal events. The next month, starting on November 3, Community CAMP Creations are being celebrated, with more bonus weekends (this time they&#x27;ll add double XP into the mix), and a legendary purveyor sale.
The main event though is in December, as the Nuka-World On Tour fully-fledged update will arrive, which brings in more content. Bethesda also confirms that it&#x27;ll &quot;reopen the Public Test Server for a new round of playtesting next month [October].&quot; As a reminder, all of that takes place on Steam now with the shutdown of the Bethesda Launcher.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown on the Fallout 76 December update - Nuka-World On Tour:
We have a story tease from Bethesda: &quot;The Fizziest Show on Earth has kicked the irradiated dust off the tires and hit the road&quot;
It&#x27;ll feature new public events, as well as a region boss public event series
Nuka-World On Tour will kick off Season 11 (currently we&#x27;re on Season 10 with The Pitt update, titled &quot;The City of Steel&quot;)
Here&#x27;s an up-to-date Fallout 76 2022 roadmap:

                              <span>Solving crimes with haymakers
In a surprisingly unceremonious piece of news, publisher Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have quietly ported detective thrillers Judgment and Lost Judgment onto PC. The two Judgment titles are now available to purchase via the Steam platform, priced at around $40 and $60 USD, respectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hT6np8elumk
Judgment (2018) and its sequel Lost Judgment (2021), follows the adventures of lawyer-turned-private detective Takayuki Yagami, as he becomes embroiled in various escalating mysteries on the mean streets of Kamurocho — which just happen to be the setting for Ryu ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s flagship franchise, Like a Dragon. In the Judgment titles, players follow trails of evidence, interrogate perps, and solve minor and major crimes, more often than not at the end of a skinny-jeans-borne spin-kick.
Much like its Ryu Ga Gotoku brethren, the Judgment titles are renowned for their brutal martial arts combat, stylish nightlife settings, and abundance of dopey, tonally inconsistent mini-games and side activities. Both titles are solid, and well worth checking out if you&#x27;ve exhausted the Yakuza catalog and are looking for something to tide you over until the release of the just announced Like a Dragon 8.
Judgment and Lost Judgment are available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Stadia, and PC platforms.

                              <span>The Straw Hat Pirates set out for a new adventure
Bandai Namco Entertainment has locked in a release date for One Piece Odyssey. The RPG based on the massive manga series will set sail on January 13, 2023.
Previously, One Piece Odyssey was going to set sail sometime this year. Today at the Tokyo Game Show 2022, Bandai Namco moved that target just a hair into the new year.
One Piece Odyssey producer Katsuaki Tsuzuki explains in a new video message that while the team originally targeted this year, launching in January gives them more time in production and brushing up the quality of the RPG.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GHXtyxULPX0
Today&#x27;s release date announcement trailer lays out the story of the new adventure. The Straw Hat crew heads to new shores, where they encounter a mysterious new character and get tangled up in a little more than they might have bargained for. This new adventure will touch on &quot;classic memories&quot; of the Straw Hat Pirates as well.
A pirate RPG
While the look of One Piece Odyssey definitely seems like it&#x27;s locked in, the other appealing factor is that this is an RPG. Rather than more action-oriented games that have rolled out for other manga adaptations, One Piece Odyssey is a role-playing game.
Hopefully we&#x27;ll get to see more of the battle system ahead of launch, as we&#x27;ve only seen a few snippets up to this point. But the UI style, as well as the general look of the game, all seem really great.
Plus, for the heavy One Piece fans out there, Odyssey is getting a tie-in statue that looks rad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2Ab4PwRZ9UQ
One Piece Odyssey sets off for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on January 13, 2023.

Not a whole lot is out on the eShop this week, coming off of the release of Splatoon 3. As announced in a recent Nintendo Direct presentation, Various Daylife is out now: but it actually came out two days ago directly following the stream. NBA 2K23 is also out today on Switch, as is Bear &amp; Breakfast. You may recall for the latter that the Switch version was delayed last-minute, but it seems everything is sorted now. Return to Monkey Island rounds out the week, but it doesn&#x27;t arrive until September 19.
Coming up next for Nintendo in terms of big releases: Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (October 20) and Bayonetta 3 (October 28), in late-October-ish. We can likely expect the following weeks to pick up when it comes to raw eShop game output, with enough room from Splatoon 3.

Atlus has opened pre-orders on the long-awaited PS5, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch ports of its mega-selling JRPG Persona 5 Royal. The Digital Edition is available for wishlisting on various platforms or for outright pre-order on the PlayStation Network and the Microsoft Store.
For physical media fans, Persona 5 Royal is also available to pre-order on console in steelbook form at various retailers, priced at a pretty lofty $60 USD. This edition includes a physical copy of the game on the console platform of your choice, along with 40 DLC items such as costumes, music tracks, and more.

For the more die-hard heart stealers, Atlus has revealed a &quot;1 More&quot; collector&#x27;s edition, which is available exclusively at the official Atlus store. The snazzy set, which retails for around $120 USD, (not including shipping), contains a steelbook hard copy of Persona 5 Royal on the console platform of your choice, alongside a selection of character art prints, an arcana tarot deck, a replica of that prick Akechi&#x27;s satchel, a &quot;La Grimoire&quot; art frame, and over 40 pieces of post-release DLC.
The set is housed in fun &quot;treasure chest&quot; style packaging. Don&#x27;t kick it open, though.
Persona 5 Royal launches October 21 on PS5, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Game Pass.

                              <span>See how it compares to the original
Thanks to a new video straight from Famitsu, we have an unfettered look at 13 minutes of Crisis Core Reunion PS5 footage. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is set to debut on December 13 on basically every major platform, and after a long windup, we finally have insight as to how it will play.
Although much of the text and voiceover is in Japanese, it&#x27;s very easy to suss out what&#x27;s going on, as it focuses on the combat system first and foremost. We also get a look at the materia customization system, which can be used to change up your tactics and ability access. Beyond some standard enemy battles, there&#x27;s also a look at a boss battle with Vajradhara Wu and Vajradhara Tai, followed by a confrontation with Ifrit. The latter takes several minutes to complete, as the game shows off its limit break system and Final Fantasy VII reminiscent soundtrack.
I should point out: the video deals with a chunk of the first chapter of the game, and the story beats seem to line up similarly, thus far. So you&#x27;re not getting a whole lot spoiled, comparatively!

                              <span>As long as it&#x27;s not &#x27;Zilla
Now this is a crossover that just makes sense. Passion Republic Games, the team behind this summer&#x27;s sleeper GigaBash, announced it&#x27;s working with one of the world&#x27;s oldest movie stars. Though details are extremely scarce, GigaBash is collaborating with Godzilla on &quot;something really special.&quot; Outside of the trailer below, that&#x27;s about all we have to go on.
Does this mean Godzilla is coming to the game as a DLC character? It&#x27;s possible. Heck, the entire Toho roster of kaiju could be joining in on the fun. But we just don&#x27;t know because the only information Passion Republic Games has given us is that it&#x27;s collaborating with Godzilla on &quot;something really special.&quot;
In fact, with such little information, this arguably isn&#x27;t a story worth reporting on. But I love Godzi…</span>

Capcom brought the goods to Tokyo Game Show this morning, not only revealing four classic characters for its upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6, but also lifting the lid on its multiplayer-based Battle Hub, its custom-character World Tour mode, and a wide variety of other features coming to the sequel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;B4qAARQdHO4
World Tour mode will see players develop their own fighter from scratch, fully customizing their bespoke fighter&#x27;s height, weight, look, style, and personality, before embarking on a journey around the Street Fighter universe, honing their abilities at the tutelage of some faithful SF World Warriors. Players can then pit their custom fighters against other characters within this world, or enter the Battl…</span>

                              <span>Capcom confirms it&#x27;s bringing the remake to one previous-gen console too
The Resident Evil 4 remake is targeting newer console hardware and PC. But today, Capcom confirms it is also bringing the Resident Evil 4 remake to PS4.
During today&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show 2022 presentation, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that Resident Evil 4 that the team had been looking into ways to bring RE4 to previous generation hardware. Because of that, Resident Evil 4 is now also in development for PS4. He doesn&#x27;t mention Xbox One though, so it seems like that console&#x27;s left off the list for now, at least.

Hirabayashi also confirms there is a Resident Evil Showcase planned for next month. No exact date has been set for that as of this writing.
Back in the saddle again
The Resident Evil 4 remake is the latest RE remake from Capcom. It&#x27;s set to re-tell the events of Leon Kennedy&#x27;s rescue of the president&#x27;s daughter, in what&#x27;s likely one of the most well-remembered entries in the Resident Evil series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-L1EuRo54pI
RE4 was long-rumored to be in development when it was finally revealed back in June, and it&#x27;s not a long wait until it&#x27;s out, either. Capcom has locked in a March 24, 2023 release date for Resident Evil 4.
The studio is also planning on PlayStation VR 2 content. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll see more of what it has planned for RE4 in particular at next month&#x27;s Resident Evil showcase. But with this news, at least PlayStation 4 owners won&#x27;t have to upgrade immediately to experience Leon&#x27;s adventure in new detail all over again.

                              <span>&quot;We&#x27;re currently working on online functions such as chip battles and chip trading&quot;
Today during Capcom&#x27;s Online Program stream (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called!), the publisher confirmed that Mega Man Battle Network Switch online play is currently being worked on.
Here&#x27;s what they had to say right on stream: &quot;We&#x27;re currently working on online functions such as chip battles and chip trading.&quot; Simple enough! This will, in theory, allow players to confront each other just like back in the portable-versus days, and trade abilities with one another. Yes, it&#x27;s highly reminiscent of Pokemon, like many other portable games of that era. Capcom used the phrase &quot;every series&quot; when they were talking about what games would be impacted, and later provided a full article regarding their online plans.
We had a few other bits of news too. On top of a fully voiced &quot;3D&quot; Mega Man main menu navigator for the main menu, extras include 1,000 illustrations and 188 songs across the represented games. You can find a reminder of what games are included in the Mega Man Battle Network re-release effort below. Capcom is calling the game a &quot;two-part&quot; release, due out in 2023 (no precise date was provided in the stream today).
Mega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 1 game list:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 2 game list:
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team ProtoMan
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar

                              <span>Everybody walk the dinosaur
During its Tokyo Game Show (TGS) live stream, Capcom dropped an action-packed new trailer for its sci-fi dinosaur shooter, Exoprimal. The new preview introduces us to some of the team members tasked with stopping the inter-dimensional invasion tearing the fabric of time and space asunder.
In addition to the TGS trailer, Capcom demonstrated some of the character classes that will be available to Exoprimal players locked into battle in the team-based shooter. Also showcased was the game&#x27;s customization mode, which will enable players to ensure that their soldier stands out from the pack.
Hey, you might get swallowed by a T-Rex out there on the battlefield, but you can at least look stylish while doing so. Exoprimal will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms at some point in 2023.

By the time the next Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak update hits, we&#x27;ll be entering a new era in terms of paid cosmetic DLC.
As revealed in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Online Program&quot; TGS stream today, amid a number of content updates coming in Title Update 2 — including the Violet Mizutsune, Flaming Espinas, and Risen Chameleos monsters — is the ability to unlock layered weapons. As a reminder, &quot;layered&quot; is a mechanic similar to &quot;transmog/glamour&quot; in other games, where you can make certain items (or characters) look a certain way. It allows players more freedom to customize their avatars, without having to take the aesthetic form of your current gear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LaSIWBfT7fg
In series fashion, goofy weapon skins like corn cobs and kebabs were shown, in addition to more serious designs like the &quot;Lost Code&quot; weaponry that looks like it&#x27;s out of a Gundam series. Beyond weapons, Capcom managed to throw in the phrase &quot;various other paid DLC as well&quot; in the stream, which they explained later in the presentation. Gestures, poses, hairstyles, and stickers were confirmed as part of the paid DLC initiative. There will also be weekly quests, with &quot;unique rewards.&quot; One gesture shown in the video was a character saying &quot;best doggo&quot; and shaking their Palamute&#x27;s hand.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Update Version 1.2 (Title Update 2) will arrive on September 29.
The current (as of September 2022) Sunbreak update roadmap:

Sunbreak update paid DLC/quest item previews:

Activision Blizzard has released the official trailer for the newest hero heading to Overwatch 2 — Kiriko is a young Japanese woman, a skillful practitioner of ninjutsu, who uses her stealth ability, mastery of martial arts, and seemingly almost supernatural skills in order to bring the win home for her team.
In addition, Activision Blizzard released its layout plans for the new shooter sequel&#x27;s first season of content, detailing events, unlocks, battle pass rewards, and much more. Kiriko had been previously leaked online, but it&#x27;s still nice to see her get her official moment in the spotlight. She looks pretty rad, too.
Overwatch 2 launches as a free-to-play title on October 4.

A Stranger Things actor is getting behind the wheel for a PlayStation picture. David Harbour has been cast to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions feature will cast Harbour as a retired driver and mentor. Harbour has garnered notoriety as Hopper in Stranger Things and as the Red Guardian in the Marvel universe.
The Gran Turismo movie will follow a teenage Gran Turismo player whose skills in-game lead to him winning a series of Nissan competitions. And thanks to his skills, he gets a chance to become a professional racecar driver.

Neill Blomkamp, of District 9, is directing the project, with a script written by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin. Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi is executive producing, alongside Hall.
It&#x27;s set for a theatrical premiere on August 11, 2023.
More PlayStation pictures on the way
Sony has quite a number of different media projects and adaptations on the way, alongside Gran Turismo.
The HBO series of The Last of Us recently got a short teaser. A Twisted Metal TV adaptation has wrapped filming for the Peacock streaming service. Netflix recently confirmed its Horizon series is in development under The Umbrella Academy&#x27;s showrunner.
And that&#x27;s not counting reports of several other projects in development, ranging from Days Gone to Gravity Rush.
Basically, a lot of PlayStation franchises are getting their shot at the silver screen. Which, given the reception to Uncharted, could be a good or bad thing. What HBO has shown so far for The Last of Us TV series seems to be getting the tone right, at the least.
As for the Gran Turismo series, Gran Turismo 7 sounds like it turned out pretty solid. Hopefully that bodes well for its media adaptation aspirations.

If you&#x27;re looking to add a game (or three) to your digital Nintendo Switch collection, here&#x27;s a friendly nudge. Between the Blockbuster Sale and several other publisher promos going on right now, there are a lot of deals to peruse on the Nintendo Switch eShop.
No, no — not that Blockbuster. But I sure do have fond memories of picking out N64 games for weekend rentals. With so many potential games to try and limited knowledge, it was a surprisingly high-stakes decision. You also had to be okay with less-than-satisfying games — you got what you got and enjoyed it as much as possible.
For this Switch eShop Blockbuster Sale, Nintendo is highlighting games like LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, Mo…</span>

                              <span>It features the recently-revealed ending theme
The Sonic Frontiers Super Sonic trailer is here, thanks to a new clip Sega is sharing to celebrate the week of TGS (Tokyo Game Show).
It&#x27;s a shortish little clip, giving us a little more background on the Starfall Islands, the locales therein, and some gameplay. At the end, we get a front-and-center look at the emeralds and the iconic Super Sonic power. &quot;Harnessing the power of the emeralds&quot; is a big part of the storyline this time around. As Sega puts it, &quot;The Starfall Islands are home to strange and menacing foes that Sonic has never encountered before. Using an all-new battle system, join Sonic in confronting these titanic threats with upgraded combat skills, evasive maneuvers, and a few familiar tricks up his sleeve. Jump into adventure, harness the power of the Emeralds, and fight to stop these new, mysterious enemies!&quot;
As you might have surmised, the trailer showcases the ending theme for the game once again: &quot;Vandalize&quot; from ONE OK ROCK. So far it seems to be getting more praise than the main theme, &quot;I&#x27;m Here,&quot; from Merry Kirk-Holmes of To Octavia. If I had to compare the two, I would be OK (ha) with cementing Vandalize as the main theme.
So far, Sonic Frontiers is ticking more boxes the more time goes on. Now I don&#x27;t want to sink into the Sonic Cycle and instill too much hope! But the Cyber Space level showing really hit home for me, and there was only one way they could have gone since the shaky initial showing of the game: up.

We knew it was coming to next-gen machines, but now it’s also headed to Sony’s older home console. However, it seems this remake will be skipping the Xbox One, possibly due to a lack of power or sales.

Only on the day Powerwash Simulator was announced for the Switch would a title like Gas Station Simulator not take us by surprise. You would think that the life sim genre had reached its strangely-specific peak with the likes of Goat Simulator, but — as a cursory search of &#x27;simulator&#x27; on the Switch eShop will show — you would be wrong. Perfect for all those of you harbouring dreams of running your own petrol station, this garage sim comes to the Switch on October 20th.
In a time in which many are feeling the strain of rising petrol prices, the chance to run a virtual station of your own may not be the stuff of your dreams. But what if we told you that you also get to micromanage your finances as you attempt to keep the station open? Now we&#x27;ve got you, right?

Indie-dev-turned-publishing powerhouse Thunderful has announced the release date for the next video game based around Denmark&#x27;s most beloved export (well, bacon and the lovely Felix on our video team are pretty good, too). Lego Bricktales is launching on Switch — and all the other places you usually find your video games — on 12th October.
First announced back in March and coming from Clockstone Studio, the developer behind the Bridge Constructor series, this game is less about bashing the scenery to collect studs and more about actually building things. And then using those things to solve puzzles across five biomes (including jungles, cities, and Medieval castles) as &quot;you search for inspiration to help your grandfather reinvigorate his rundown amusement park.&quot;

The 2022 Tokyo Game Show has kicked off, and earlier today, Capcom took to the stage to run through its slate of upcoming releases and updates. And one of the company&#x27;s big featured titles was the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, and this won&#x27;t just be a simple collection of ten games, oh no. Director Masakazu Eguchi took to the stage to announce that Capcom will be implementing online battles for every single game in the collection.
This is no doubt fantastic news for fans of the original games, which included the ability to link up with a Game Link Cable and battle and trade chips. Now you&#x27;ll be able to do it online with all ten games. We really will be part of the Battle Network! Chip Trading is also returning, which will also be supported online.

We&#x27;ve finally found out the title of Breath of the Wild 2 (which means we can stop calling it Breath of the Wild 2) alongside a brand-new trailer in the latest Nintendo Direct — and it&#x27;s called Tears of the Kingdom, which has already set off a ton of theories.

If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to the news, this week&#x27;s Japanese charts from Famitsu will be pretty predictable. Splatoon 3 has inked all over the charts, and — in the week of 5th to 11th September — the third squid-based shooter has sold just under a staggering 2 million copies.
These are only physical copies, of course. We say &#x27;only&#x27; with a mountain of salt and irony, of course, because in just three days, Splatoon 3 smashed Japanese launch sales records, selling nearly 3.5 million (digitally and physically). 1,934,680 boxed retail copies sold is unprecedented.

Polishing off the last few shrines and giving Calamity Ganon what-for in the final battle of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was a bittersweet act. After such a wonderful, rich journey it was time to bid farewell to Link, Zelda and the largest, most expansive iteration of Hyrule we’d ever visited - what were we going to do with ourselves?

With the Tokyo Games Show 2022 bound to bring us news galore from the JRPG genre, KEMCO&#x27;s latest sale (who would have thought they&#x27;d do another one?) is here to ensure that your Nintendo consoles are sufficiently stocked to the very brim in that genre department as we head into Fall — especially after all the games announced during this week&#x27;s Direct Showcase.
It is true that KEMCO can be a bit of a machine for churning out games of this type, and we would be hesitant to suggest that the majority of them develop the genre to any real extent; however, a sale like this is nonetheless a good chance to pad out your collection if you find yourself somewhat drawn to the company&#x27;s style.

The &#x27;90s gave us a ton of platforming mascots — Sonic, Gex, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, Aero the Acro-Bat, James Pond, and the list goes on.

If you cast your mind back to 2020, you may remember the sworded release of a little game called Cooking Mama: Cookstar. Controversy surrounded the game after the mild-mannered cooking sim was abruptly pulled from the Switch eShop shortly after its release, leading to rumours of built-in cryptocurrency mining, unlawful use of copyrighted music, and disputes between the game&#x27;s developer and publisher, Planet Entertainment, and the owners of the Cooking Mama series, Office Create.
Now distanced from the flame-eyed matriarch who has dominated Nintendo cooking titles since the mid-2000s, Planet Entertainment has announced its next chef-sim, Yum Yum Cookstar, will be coming to the Switch on October 4th, 2022.

Brazil-based developer Behold Studios is best known for delivering the Super Sentai/Power Rangers-inspired RPG Chroma Squad back in 2015. Now, the developer is moving on from tokusatsu to magical girl with its next game, Mahou Senshi Cosplay Club. This marks the developer&#x27;s return to its RPG roots following 2019&#x27;s party game Out of Space.
Announced yesterday, the game is slated for a 2023 release on &quot;PC and major consoles&quot;, so it looks like a Switch version is on the horizon. However, it&#x27;s not just the game&#x27;s premise — where you play as a girl who gains magical powers by cosplaying and dressing up — that has us intrigued. Mahou Senshi Cosplay Club&#x27;s polygonal graphics remind us of a lost, late N64 RPG that we never got, albeit with the power of modern-day design to make the colours really pop and the visuals a lot smoother.

If you have read near enough any of the articles here at Nintendo Life over the past few weeks, you will know that we are serious fans of Splatoon 3. The game seems to balance those little quirks that made the former games so successful, with just enough new features that the latest entry really does feel like &quot;the pinnacle of the series&quot; (as our glowing review so succinctly puts it).
But of all the new features, there is one which stands head and shoulders above the rest. &quot;What is this new game-changing feature of which you speak?&quot; we hear you ask, &quot;is it the incredibly fun Salmon Run, now consistently playable? The wonderful new story mode? The fresh maps for Turf War Battles?&quot; No, it&#x27;s the locker thing.

                              <span>There has been a number of different efforts in recent time to further enhance the Linux kernel&#x27;s scheduler to better adapt to modern hardware architectures whether it be for Intel hybrid CPU designs, adapting to new CPU cache configurations, or just better scaling with today&#x27;s ever-increasing core counts. Another scheduler effort detailed this week is &quot;Nest&quot; that aims to keep tasks on &quot;warm cores&quot; with hopes of lower latency due to being already at higher clock/performance states and ideally operating at an optimal turbo/boost frequency. The Nest developers find that their scheduler &quot;improves performance 10%-2x and can reduce energy usage&quot; with modern hardware...</span>

EAS employs an energy model for helping to place tasks between the big.LITTLE cores for optimal energy efficiency and a minimal impact on throughput.

During today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed four more fighters joining the Street Fighter 6 roster alongside new details about the upcoming fighting game’s World Tour, Battle Hub, and more. 
All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That&#x27;s when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that&#x27;s all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


&quot;[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game&#x27;s four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.&quot;
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

                              <span>Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass&#x27; free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko&#x27;s Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Holy shit. It was just two months ago that I was asking Sega, very nicely, to maybe think about bringing the Yakuza series’ historical spin-off games to the West. Now, today, Sega only went and announced that one of them is indeed on the way, and has been remade for modern hardware to boot.

                              <span>You&#x27;re gonna need a new flashbulb
Some very pleasant news today for fans of the delightful indie hit TOEM: A Photo Adventure as developer Something We Made has announced that it is currently working on a DLC update for the snap-happy adventure, which will launch on all platforms, free of charge, at an unspecified date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;O7N8mO84A6s
Speaking on the PlayStation Blog, Something We Made CEO Niklas Mikkelsen revealed that the update will include a brand new region, Basto, which will be unlocked once the player completes the main story adventure. Basto is an amalgamation of some of the ideas that did not make the cut for the initial release, and will feature new puzzles, characters, and even a brand new camera attachment: The Water Popper.
With six new music tracks, 20 new quests, and 20 new compendium critters to track down, Something We Made is predicting a good couple of hours of new adventure await all visitors to Basto. If you&#x27;re yet to check out TOEM, then it should be noted that it is currently available as one of September&#x27;s PlayStation Plus Essential releases for PS5. It is also available to purchase on PC and Nintendo Switch. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen&#x27;s very positive review right here.
We&#x27;ll be sure to let you all know when a release date for the TOEM DLC is officially announced.

Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they&#x27;re mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that&#x27;s faster and stronger. And sure enough, that&#x27;s exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; marketing thus far. It&#x27;s also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they&#x27;re out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties&#x27; inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it&#x27;s remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new &quot;Ambush&quot; trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it&#x27;s looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February.</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game&#x27;s announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu&#x27;s life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he&#x27;s seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 delivers breathtaking clarity and a riveting next-gen experience, but will it have the games to make you want it?
When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp. The display resolution is 2000x2040 per eye, and the games can run at smooth framerat…</span>

                              <span>The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it&#x27;s called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he&#x27;s back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it&#x27;s Hero time – remember, he&#x27;s a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.</span>

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and if you&#x27;re at all familiar with Team Ninja&#x27;s other games, you&#x27;re probably going to be into this one. It&#x27;s not quite clear if it&#x27;s taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software&#x27;s hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won&#x27;t hit PlayStation 5 until 2024. 
Are you excited for Rise of Ronin? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>In most regions of the world, the problem of IPTV piracy isn&#x27;t going away, despite attempts to take illegal services down using enforcement agencies and ISP blocking. In Hungary a new anti-piracy option has been placed on the table - cyberattacks against IPTV pirates. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>EA and developers Maxis have revealed today that The Sims 4 will be going free to play from October 18th. You’ll be able to grab it on Steam, Origin or the EA app. There had been rumours circulating online earlier today that an announcement was incoming from EA on this, and those were evidently legit. More information on the future of The Sims will be coming on October 18th too, EA said, at an event dubbed the Behind The Sims Summit.

The game’s part of a “transmedia sci-fi franchise” being worked on by very bluntly named devs Game Studio, according to publishers Bandai Namco. The game’s out in 2023, though. Suit up and boot up by watching the trailer below.

Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya&#x27;s son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn&#x27;t reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, we not only learned that but also, finally, a release date. We now know the game&#x27;s name is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.


In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won&#x27;t be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</span>

Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

An ornate white tunic and cape adorn the red and blue-haired protagonist. You control this character, known as the Divine Dragon, fighting alongside iconic warriors from past games to help seal away the ancient Fell Dragon that has reawakened and is threatening the Continent of Elyos. 
Fire Emblem Engage: Divine Edition, a physical collector&#x27;s copy of the game, features unique box art, a logo-less steelbook, art cards, a sizable art book, and a copy of the game.</span>

                              <span>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts&#x27; It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards&#x27; 2021&#x27;s Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend&#x27;s pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said &quot;It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.&quot;
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.</span>

The first game in the series, Octopath Traveler, was released exclusively on Switch in 2018 before making its way to PC the following year, Stadia in 2020, and finally, Xbox One in 2021. It seems Nintendo is ready to take us back to that world and its excellent HD-2D visual style because it announced Octopath Traveler II is coming to Switch February 24, 2023. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, Octopath Traveler II is looking great, as expected. Rather than picking up with our previous heroes, this sequel presents us with eight new travelers: the warrior Hikari, the dancer Agnea, the merchant Partitio, the scholar Osvald, the thief Throné, the cleric Temenos, t…</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077&#x27;s first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR&#x27;s vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; Nowakowski said during the call. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there&#x27;s just going to be one major expansion. However, there&#x27;s going to be new stuff in the future.&quot; 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there&#x27;s also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it&#x27;s something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion.

                              <span>Developer Platinum Games and publisher Square Enix have revealed that Babylon&#x27;s Fall will shut down next year, less than a full year after its March 3 launch this year. 
More specifically, Platinum Games will terminate the game&#x27;s service on February 27, 2023. As for why, the team didn&#x27;t really outline the reason but it&#x27;s likely due to the game&#x27;s poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game&#x27;s issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has &quot;no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon&#x27;s Fall.&quot; It seems things have changed because Babylon&#x27;s Fall will fall early next year.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of the announcement of a long-awaited Nintendo Direct, PlayStation announced that tomorrow will also feature a special livestreamed presentation of its own. Now, in addition to that aforementioned Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, we&#x27;re now also receiving a PlayStation State of Play stream in the afternoon.
The news comes as Tokyo Game Show looms, giving publishers a massive convention to piggyback off of. According to PlayStation, tomorrow&#x27;s show will feature updates from some of the company&#x27;s Japanese partners, as well as surprises from developers all around the world. Tomorrow&#x27;s presentation is set to last approximately 20 minutes and will feature new updates and gameplay footage from 10 games across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR2.
This PlayStation State of Play stream is set for tomorrow, September 13 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it live on PlayStation&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels. Of course, if you miss the show, we&#x27;ll have all the biggest announcements covered right here on Game Informer.</span>

At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

                              <span>One of the best developments in PC gaming over the past five years has been the arrival of the entire, silly, joyous Yakuza series on our platform. Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

                              <span>I only just realised, while mentioning the dev&#x27;s next game, that we never posted about excellent indie horror game Mothered. Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

You’ll have to make do with the Switch trailer below for now, I’m afraid, because Squeenix haven’t released a PC one yet.

                              <span>Anime show Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is streaming on Netflix from today, more than two years after the big tudum and Cyberpunk 2077 developers CD Projekt announced they were working together. The show may have hit whatever the 21st century equivalent of airwaves is and become a tangible piece of media to consume now, but CD Projekt have confirmed in an earnings call that they’re still “fully committed” to continuing with the Cyberpunk IP. I can’t believe I just typed the term IP.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

                              <span>Correctly striking a succession of notes in a rhythm game gives me a huge high, but I&#x27;m more familiar with feeling the corresponding low. A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

                              <span>Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. 
We already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft&#x27;s long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that &quot;Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.&quot; 
In 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn&#x27;t, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, &quot;In terms of pricing, we&#x27;ve been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.&quot; Today&#x27;s Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.
Ubisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It&#x27;s worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.
You can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft&#x27;s troubled workplace culture, the company&#x27;s current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint&#x27;s integration of them, and plenty more here.</span>

                              <span>When Danny Peña was a child, he would spend hours playing games at his local New York arcade before he received his first console, an Atari 2600, from his grandmother. Peña knew early on that he wanted to do something in the games industry, but he didn&#x27;t know what. All along the way, he was told that video games won&#x27;t pay the bills, but he didn&#x27;t let that deter him. Flash forward a couple of decades, and Peña returned to New York to show his mother a billboard featuring his face in Times Square – a monument to his success in the games industry, but not one that was easy to achieve. Now, with a new children&#x27;s book called Danny Loves Video Games about his life and career set to release this week, I sat down with Peña to chat about his road to this point.

The news comes by way of Ross&#x27; Twitter account, which mentions that she wished to stay with Halo until the upcoming Winter Update, but she is leaving the studio amid a family medical issue. 
Since the studio&#x27;s founding in 2007 under Ross, 343 Industries has worked on several Halo games, including Halo 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. The studio fully took over the Halo franchise following Bungie&#x27;s departure from the brand after 2010&#x27;s Halo: Reach. Ross oversaw the Halo franchise for Microsoft and Xbox ever since.

Metal: Hellsinger knows precisely what it is from the second it begins: a love letter to fast-paced first-person shooters, especially Doom, and a tribute to metal music and the culture surrounding it. It’s a no-frills shooter that asks, “What if you had to blow bodies to pieces to the beat of a metal album made by genre greats?” It excels at answering that question. It’s not perfect – the bosses are uninspired at times, and it could use an extra dash of variety in combat design – but my criticisms mattered little to my overall enjoyment of my 1…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will livestream a Nintendo Direct tomorrow.
More specifically, the Direct will begin at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET tomorrow, Sept. 13, and it will run for roughly 40 minutes. That&#x27;s one of the largest Directs of the year, so it will likely be jam-packed with new looks at previously announced games and new ones, too (perhaps a Zelda port or two, if rumors about this Direct are correct). As for what to expect, Nintendo says the Direct will &quot;mostly&quot; focus on Switch games launching this Winter. 
Tune in at 7 a.m. PT tomorrow, 9/13, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching this winter.

The key word here is &quot;mostly&quot; because that leaves just enough room for Nintendo to discuss and/or announce games coming next year. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Direct is less than 24 hours away. 
If you&#x27;re in the U.K., please see the tweet below: 
As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 is already shaping up to be another hit for the franchise and Nintendo. Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. 
This includes both digital and physical sales. It&#x27;s safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that&#x27;s exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.&#x27;s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it&#x27;s possible that decline isn&#x27;t present when digital games are taken into account. There&#x27;s no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. 


&quot;Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,&quot; a Nintendo press release reads. &quot;This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.&quot; 
It&#x27;s no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it&#x27;s great! And you can read about why in the Game Informer Splatoon 3 review.

We’re still quite a way off from then, but Sony have released a smattering more gameplay footage today, detailing the moves you&#x27;ll be pulling as heroine Frey &quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot; Holland. Alas, said footage has been crushed down to only a handful of GIFs over on the PlayStation Blog, but our friends at Eurogamer have a bigger, chunkier hands on preview that tells us more about why it won&#x27;t be mega cringe. Alas, we weren&#x27;t privy to this Forspoken demo, so have a watch with us below.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.

Pokud nemůžete nastavit PL1 a PL2 v Biosu, v Linuxu je možné použít powercap-utils a rozhraní Intel RAPL (Running Average Power Limit). PL1 a PL2 jde přečíst pomocí powercap-info a zapsat pomocí  powercap-set.</span>

                              <span>Ace Stream is a decentralized streaming tool with millions of users. The application, built on the VLC media player, doesn&#x27;t host or link to any content, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped rightsholders from complaining. In fact, the software&#x27;s website is currently blocked by ISPs in Spain, which is completely unjustified according to Ace Stream&#x27;s management.

                              <span>Sony have been regularly releasing games on PC for a while now, with an often quick turnaround between &#x27;announcement&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27;s out now&#x27;. The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn&#x27;t arrived.

It seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection&#x27;s Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.

                              <span>Valve have opened repair centres for the Steam Deck. These are where you&#x27;ll send your handheld PC if it develops a problem, either so Valve can fix it free-of-charge if it&#x27;s still under warranty, or so they can diagnose the problem and quote you a repair price if it&#x27;s not. &quot;If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,&quot; say Valve.

                              <span>Before announcing a bazillion Assassin&#x27;s Creed games during tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward stream, the publisher did first show a handful of other games. Among them was a first look at The Division: Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off from the Clancyverse shooter, which was described as an &quot;action survival shooter.&quot; You can watch it below.

                              <span>As was leaked, and then hurriedly confirmed by Ubisoft about a week ago, the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game to come out will be Mirage, in 2023. It&#x27;s not going to be quite the massive open world adventure &#x27;em up that the last few entries have been (don&#x27;t worry; one of those is on the way as well), but a more classic AssCreed experience to mark the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan. Or, to put it another way, I fear that playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage may induce a pathetic but very real existential crisis in me.

                              <span>A not-insignificant part of the Ubisoft Forward livestream tonight was dedicated to Assassin&#x27;s Creed. To celebrate the doughty action-adventure&#x27;s 15th anniversary, senior community developer Alice Terrett was joined by a, to his credit, very excited Danny &quot;it&#x27;s the Daddy&quot; Wallace, to lay out an almost MCU-like timeline of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed thing happening for the next good while. It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year&#x27;s more trad and compact Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, is Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series. And it&#x27;s set in feudal Japan.

                              <span>About a year ago we learned about the existence of something called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity (or, more precisely, Project Infinity, but we&#x27;re all just calling it Infinity). The suggestion that Assassin&#x27;s Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is &quot;going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise in the future&quot;.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of the most affordable &#x27;second-gen&#x27; PCIe 4.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to a storming 6600MB/s while costing less than alternatives like the Samsung 980 Pro and WD Black SN850. As you may have guessed from the title of this post, it&#x27;s also on sale at Amazon for a very reasonable price: £59 gets you a 500GB model compared to a UK RRP of £101.

I don&#x27;t miss those 5am sunrises either. So we can surely all agree that the sensible course of action would be to lock sunrise to 7:30am and rotate the whole clock around that. Anyway!

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage
This game was officially revealed last week following extensive leaks, and as expected, Ubisoft had a lot more to share about it during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is taking the lead role this time, but he&#x27;ll be much younger. This game follows his journey from a thief on the luscious and diverse streets of Golden Age Baghdad in 861 to an apprentice of the Hidden Ones to a master assassin. It also represents a return to the series&#x27; roo…</span>

As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game&#x27;s protagonist, setting, and more. 
If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today&#x27;s presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he&#x27;s not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he&#x27;s a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.
First up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.
In addition to the Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we&#x27;ll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.</span>

                              <span>Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney&#x27;s annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.
On the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne&#x27;s Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson&#x27;s first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008&#x27;s The Incredible Hulk.
We also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).
Marvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.
The Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch&#x27;s second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season&#x27;s filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward presentation, the publisher showed off new footage of a boss battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.


This time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.
Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.</span>

                              <span>In the world of Marvel Comics, the word &quot;ensemble&quot; invokes thoughts of the Avengers, X-Men, or Fantastic Four. Recently, we learned Skydance New Media and Marvel Entertainment were working on an ensemble Marvel video game. The internet&#x27;s rumor mill believed this game would focus on Reed Richards and his fantastic family. Yesterday, during the Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase, we learned this ensemble wasn&#x27;t Fantastic Four, Avengers, or any known Marvel team whatsoever. Skydance is creating its own team of four heroes, set to the backdrop of World War II.
The timeframe has Captain America front and center fighting against Hydra and Nazi troops. Through a narrative twist, Wakanda gets involved, and players gain control of Black Panther, but not the one you know. This Black Panther is Azzuri, T…</span>

As was leaked, it&#x27;s about Captain America and Black Panther working to fight against Hydra during World War 2. What I didn&#x27;t expect at all was that the game still wouldn&#x27;t have a name, although there are a few other details to glean from the most teasery teaser trailer.

                              <span>Foxhole hits 1.0 later this month after years in Steam Early Access, and the update will bring the most exciting possible addition to the massively multiplayer war game: trains. Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Blizzard VP Jon Spector confirmed that heroes will be available through a free track for the battle pass. Spector’s comments were an attempt to put an end to speculation over what he described as “incomplete info” circulating online about Overwatch 2’s battle pass.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like you&#x27;re sitting down with a game like a worried parent, saying &quot;I just don&#x27;t know what to do with you?&quot; Because that&#x27;s how I feel about Phoenix Point after the last few months of playing it on and off. I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

                              <span>Monster-taming MMO Temtem just launched out of early access on PC earlier this week, but developers Crema have taken to Discord to defend the game’s paid battle pass. Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

In order to save the cosy town of Sainte-et-Claire, a charming mouse called Lila and a soft spirit called Lumion join forces to restore the town and its people. They&#x27;ll be teaming up on Steam later this month on September 26th. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The claims are broadly similar - the ISP turned a blind eye to piracy, failed to disconnect repeat infringers, and has lost its safe harbor from liability. In addition to millions in damages, the plaintiffs demand user disconnections and pirate site blockades.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
