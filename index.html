Sega took the blue blur in a bold new direction last year with the release of its open-zone adventure Sonic Frontiers.
Parent company Sega Sammy has now spoken about the game&#x27;s reception and sales success in a Q&amp;A with investors - revealing the latest entry has &quot;greatly exceeded&quot; the original sales estimation. Frontiers is expected to continue to sell over the long term as well with the assistance of discounts and updates in the form of DLC.

                              <span>A small slice of Ryoma&#x27;s swordplay
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is not far off from launch. But if the wait&#x27;s just a bit too long, there&#x27;s a demo for Ishin out today so you can get a taste of the new-old combat.
The &quot;Combat Demo&quot; is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The two-part combat demo covers a roughly 20-minute section of the game, specifically spotlighting the combat of Like a Dragon: Ishin, which sees Ryoma bringing his sword, gun, and fists to bear against foes.
The slice of Ishin covers both a brawl at Kiyomizu temple and a face-off with some armored foes. This demo looks to spotlight not just the fighting, but what enemies are bringing to the table to try and stop Ryoma. If he&#x27;s anything like his supposed descendant, though, there&#x27;s not much that can.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kqkDNGqWrvE
Sega and RGG Studio have also revealed a special &quot;Dragon of Dojima&quot; skin, that will make Sakamoto Ryoma look just like Kazuma Kiryu, suit and all.
Heading back to an older era
Ishin is a remake of the earlier entry in the series, one which we never saw ported over to the west. It&#x27;s historical fiction, using the likenesses of many Like a Dragon series characters, but with different names, playing figures from the time in dramatized versions of the events.
Still, just because Kiryu is actually Ryoma, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t some classic Like a Dragon to get up to. Alongside the brawling you can see in the Ishin combat demo, there&#x27;s also the usual substories and side-games you&#x27;d expect from the series. Plus, an Another Life section where Ryoma can live it up as a peaceful farmer. What&#x27;s not to like about a slice of farming life inside this classically action-heavy series?
Like a Dragon: Ishin! goes live on Feburary 17 for Deluxe Digital pre-orders, and on February 21 for every other version.

Frogwares has announced their decision to delay the release of the detective adventure Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. Initially, they had planned for the game to be out the door by February or March, but now they’re predicting it could land as late as April.
Frogwares has released a video to go along with the announcement to outline the difficulties they have been having. The developer is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and because of the Russian invasion targeting the country’s energy infrastructure, the team has had trouble maintaining a work schedule. The video also outlines how some members have to alternate working remotely and in office, depending on which site has power at the time.

While I haven’t played any of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes titles, I have gotten into The Sinking City, which I mostly enjoy. I’m mostly held back by the fact that I’ve never read any of the novels. Frogwares started their adventure series based off Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories back in 2001. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a full remake of their third game, released back in 2007. They’ve been at it for a long time, and the series has gained its share of fans.
Frogwares isn’t the only developer trying to put together a game during an invasion. Much of Digital Dreams Entertainment, developers of Mutant Football League, are trying to create a sequel to their Football title. Likewise, GSC Gameworld is still pushing toward a release for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and has already had to delay it for the same reason.
Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in March or April.

                              <span>Earlier today we looked at the most affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD, with the Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB at $99.99, and now it&#x27;s time to look at one of the very fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD SN850x. It&#x27;s down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall &#x27;fastest SSD&#x27; recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

That&#x27;s a heavy reduction from its original $169.99 price point, and an awesome value for a drive that works well in PCs and even PS5s.

                              <span>Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn&#x27;t make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says &quot;it&#x27;s pretty tough - you&#x27;ve been warned&quot;. I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother&#x27;s throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who&#x27;ve moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It&#x27;s difficult enough that I didn&#x27;t think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn&#x27;t restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they&#x27;re simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn&#x27;t a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

                              <span>From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.
In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I&#x27;d actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it&#x27;s basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I&#x27;ve also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I&#x27;ve realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

The team have described the initiative as a launchpad for indies in the “rapidly growing Danish games industry and beyond.” Ghost Ship Publishing haven’t announced any games yet, but we’ll get to see their upcoming projects on March 2nd as part of Deep Rock Galactic’s fifth-anniversary livestream.

                              <span>Has it ever taken you 10 years to finish a task? If so, you&#x27;ll either love or hate this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast, where we discuss the surprising release date of 2029 for In The Valley Of Gods, the surprising advance of the Dead Island 2 launch date, and the entirely unsurprising delay(s) of Skull &amp; Bones. Do you know what the most delayed game ever is? Because the title recently changed hands. This plus what we&#x27;ve been playing, a new hardware update, and a round of &quot;what video game should Shakespeare play?&quot;

                              <span>American McGee is still trying to turn his theoretical Alice: Asylum into a reality. The last game in his dark action-platformer series, Alice: Madness Returns, released more than ten years ago, and since then McGee has been funding development through a Patreon which, at the time of writing, currently has 3,192 paying members. In 2021, McGee released the first draft of a script, and now he’s back with a 414-page design bible, the announcement of a partner studio, and an odd plea to EA.

So while other outlets will be delivering their final verdicts on Omega Force’s beast batterin’ simulator today, I’m afraid I haven’t had the chance to play enough of it to give it a fair shakedown yet. It’s good, though! I really like it, and as a huge Monster Hunter fan I’m pleased that there’s finally a worthy alternative to Capcom’s long-running series. Competition is good!

Previously, you needed to own all three Total War: Warhammer games to play Immortal Empires, since it compiles campaign maps, war units, and Legendary Lords from across the strategy trilogy. Now, you’ll just need to own Warhammer 3 for access to the campaign.

                              <span>It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I&#x27;m trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games&#x27; sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I&#x27;m completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

                              <span>Kaiju-quashing RPG Wild Hearts is out today and, eesh, the PC version is quite the technical mess. I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running. From what I’ve played, Wild Hearts’s bad shape is doing an otherwise enjoyable Monster Hunter-like a huge disservice.

                              <span>For the Druchii!
Sega and Creative Assembly have announced that one of the most lavishly massive campaigns for any strategy game is finally exiting the beta stage for Total War: Warhammer III. Immortal Empires merges the worlds of all three Total War: Warhammer games into one giant map, complete with every faction released across the series.
February 17th marks a full year since the launch of Total War: Warhammer III. During that time, the team has been plucking away at the Immortal Empires mode within it, providing it to players to collect feedback on. They’ve made tweaks and additions, such as end-game goals, and now it’s time to see it in its completed glory.
Best yet, anyone who owns Total War: Warhammer III will have access to the campaign mode. Previously, you had to own its two pred…</span>

                              <span>Eight eyes, and they&#x27;re all trained on you
Some fucking sadist has chosen absolute chaos, and developed an edition of 2020 spider-hunting title Kill It with Fire for the VR market — Yes, you can now &quot;enjoy&quot; the destructive, terrifying, hide &#x27;n&#x27; seek nature of the Man vs. Arachnid release in fully immersive virtual reality fashion. Thanks?
Kill It with Fire VR will recreate the over-the-top action of the original release, as players search a variety of locations including houses, gas stations, farms, and, of course, bathrooms for the eight-legged critters. Track down a menagerie of creepy crawlies, before engaging in mortal combat with an arsenal of household implements, ninja weapons, firearms, and other super bombastic weaponry. The virtual reality edition of this absolute nightmare will utilize a new &quot;VRACHNID&quot; mechanic to allow for better detection.

&quot;Fans have been asking for a VR version of Kill It With Fire since the very first footage of the original game,&quot; notes Casey Donnellan, solo developer of Kill It With Fire and thus a monstrous person. &quot;I&#x27;m really happy that we can finally put horrifying spiders on a screen less than an inch from players&#x27; eyeballs!&quot;
All jesting aside, I actually really like spiders. Oh, I&#x27;m pretty scared of them, and one actually bit me last year, (always shake out your shoes, folks). But I do think our scuttling pals are pretty darn cool, as well as being fascinating, intelligent, and important creatures. Anyway, Kill It with Fire VR is scheduled to launch &quot;soon&quot; on PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2, SteamVR, and Meta Quest 2.
I&#x27;m probably going to assign the review to CJ Andriessen. He&#x27;ll love it.

                              <span>Revenge is a dish best served all the time
34BigThings has announced that it&#x27;s dropping its loose interactive adaptation of Roberto Saviano’s novel Gomorrah today. The plot seems unconnected with either the book or the 2014 Italian TV show of the same name, instead utilizing a similar crime drama approach to the narrative.
In Gomorrah, you take the role Nina Miniero, the daughter of a Naplese crime boss. After Nina’s 18th birthday party is attacked and her father murdered, she takes the reins of the crime family and drives it on a collision course with revenge. You lead the family through various procedurally created missions, making each playthrough different. There are eight possible endings that you’ll reach based on your choices.
Gomorrah is presented largely as a choice-driven visual novel with visuals crafted by comic artist Luca Negri. Gameplay is largely resource management and decision-making. The team has stated that they weren’t able to work with author Roberto Saviano himself, but a screenwriter from the TV series provided some guidance.

I really enjoy the visual style of this game, and it sounds like an interesting experience. Something about it is giving me pause, however. I definitely don’t mind more menu-heavy gameplay, but it might just be that I’m not that big into violent crime drama. I’m familiar with neither the book nor the TV show. Still, at release, Gomorrah will run for $3, so it’s not a big investment if you want to take a peek.
Gomorrah is available today on PC, iOS, and Android.

                              <span>The Dragon of Dojima steps back in time
Sega and Ryu ga Gotoku Studio are currently gearing up for the launch of Like a Dragon: Ishin! A full remake of the 2014 spin-off title in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series of action-RPGS — And speaking of yesteryear, the studios announced that a special DLC skin is included in Ishin&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which sees the return of the eponymous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu!
The &quot;Dragon of Dojima&quot; DLC will allow players to dress Ishin&#x27;s hero like his centuries-later descendant, complete with his iconic silver-grey suit and snakeskin shoes. It should be noted that this is just an aesthetic skin, Sakamoto will not literally become Kazuma — But if you fancied turning the attractive, period-piece world of Edo Japan into an absolutely dreadful anachronism, then you&#x27;re sorted.
In this short trailer, you can see Sakamoto looking slick as he gets his ears cleaned out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kqkDNGqWrvE&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SEGA
Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a full remake of the 2014 PS3 release of the same name, and follows the adventures of Ryoma Sakamoto, who becomes embroiled in a local war of houses while investigating the murder of his sensei. Like a Dragon: Ishin! continues the hard-boiled drama, violent action, and a little of the tongue-in-cheek nature that is the trademark of the Like a Dragon series, but never saw the light of day outside of Japan, with Sega concerned that the game&#x27;s setting and characters might not localize well enough to warrant the effort .
One should remember that the series then was not the highly recognized brand that it has become today, specifically since the launch of 2015&#x27;s Yakuza 0, which was a huge hit on the PS4 platform.
Like a Dragon: Ishin! launches February 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

XSEED and Marvelous Europe have announced that they will be publishing BattleBrew Productions’ dungeon-crawling cooking title, Cuisineer, this summer. If you’re planning on watching the trailer, I feel I must warn you: it might make you hungry.
Cuisineer will combine the horrors of the food-service industry with the pleasures of dungeon crawling. Playing as cute-as-heck aspiring chef, Pom, you will plumb the dark recesses of the world for ingredients to serve to your customers. You’ll weaponize your utensils to take on bigger, badder bosses in an effort to build the best recipes for your discerning customers.
I’m sorry, I’m a bit distracted here. I keep looking at the food.

Beyond ingredients, dungeon diving will net you gold, items, and additional recipes. The dungeons are procedurally assembled, giving you something new each time you plumb them. As you gather wealth and renown, you’ll expand your restaurant so you can serve more customers and thereby gather even more wealth and renown.
This is cute. This reminds me of 2010’s Recettear in its combination of dungeon diving and business management. The gameplay loop of setting out into the world and returning to reap the rewards is an addicting one. Better yet, I’m enamored by the graphics. Not just the food, but just the bright colorfulness of its all, its chibi characters, and the pleasant-looking towns. Also, the food. I’m not hungry right now, but the way the highlights are drawn on those meals makes me want to eat and deal with the consequences later.
Cuisineer will be coming to PC in Summer, 2023.

                              <span>Where&#x27;s my gurl Juri at?
Here&#x27;s a delightfully nostalgic piece of memorabilia — Capcom has partnered with merchandise maker Big Shots to produce a series of rough &#x27;n&#x27; tumble plush toys based on some of the World Warriors of its iconic fighting game series, Street Fighter.
The initial Street Fighter Big Shots line features eternal rivals Ryu and Ken, as well as the All-American Guile, and the Brazilian beast Blanka. Each Big Shot is packed with premium polyester filling and printed on soft velvet polyester cover. Each character is available in two sizes — 22&quot; x 19&quot; or 16&quot; x 14&quot; — and weighs 1.5 lbs or 16 ounces, respectively. Either way, they&#x27;re built to take a kicking, so you can practice your Shoryukens until the cows come home.

Of course, fans of a certain age will no doubt be instantly reminded of the massively popular WWF Wrestling Buddies of the late &#x27;80s, which saw similar toys made of stars such as Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted Dibiase. I personally never had one myself, but I remember them being around in abundance.
So, Big Shots, drop a Juri and I can finally make up for lost toy time. 42 years old.
The Street Fighter Big Shots are available for a limited time over on the official Big Shots website. The 16&quot; versions retail for $49.99 USD, while the 22&quot; version retails for $69.99, not including shipping charges.

                              <span>Plus, two other Forge spinoffs have windows
Riot Forge, the publishing arm for spin-offs of Riot Games&#x27; League of Legends series, has locked in another game set in Runeterra. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story is an action RPG following League of Legends champion Sylas, developed by Digital Sun, and arriving this year.
The Mageseeker will see players take control of Sylas, an escaped mage in search of vengenace and looking to take it out on Demacia. It&#x27;s a 2D action RPG where Sylas and the player will raise a mage army and eventually lead a revolution. Digital Sun, the tema behind merchant RPG Moonlighter, is making The Mageseeker. It&#x27;s set to arrive in spring 2023 for PC and console.

Additionally, the Riot Forge locked in release windows for two other projects. Song of Nunu, a character-action game from Tequila Works starring Nunu and Willump, is aiming for fall 2023. And Convergence, a single-player 2D action platformer starring time-bending champion Ekko and developed by Double Stallion Games, arrives in summer 2023.
Fanning the Forge
Riot Forge covers the ongoing third-party efforts to expand out the world of League of Legends. Games have been steadily rolling out of it, too; we&#x27;ve already seen the likes of auto-runner Hextech Mayhem and the Airship Syndicate-developed RPG Ruined King.
All the while, Riot Games is also crafting its own dive into the world of League of Legends. The fighting game Project L sits somewhere on the horizon, and other projects lurk around. Add on the likes of Teamfight Tactics and the successful Arcane series, and it feels like League of Legends has expanded far beyond its MOBA bounds at this point.
That&#x27;s probably a good thing, for those who dug stories like Arcane but aren&#x27;t keen on playing some 5-on-5 in the Rift. We&#x27;ll see what the Forge has in store as more of its projects roll out throughout 2023.

Following that big Nintendo Direct and the surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered, even more games are on the way. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is the big one, and should be relevant for quite some time with DLC songs that span Square Enix&#x27;s lengthy history, and dip into multiple IPs. Oh look, we have a review for it!
Tales of Symphonia Remastered is going to be a big deal for many other RPG fans, as is Digimon World: Next Order. Those come out on February 17 and February 22 respectively. Other than that, there&#x27;s the typical 40+ game eShop dump, so be prepared to once again sift through a ton of stuff to get to something you want.
The next big milestone for Nintendo is Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe on February 24, followed by Bayonetta Origins …</span>

It’s hard to believe Flying Wild Hog’s Shadow Warrior games started off as a retro revival of the 3D Realms’ 1997 Build Engine title. While the 2013 game made references to the original, it was very much its own thing. Then I skipped the second title because it would make me feel lonely to play it by myself, and now we’re at Shadow Warrior 3, and it’s unrecognizable.
That’s where we were last year, I guess. This is Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition.
The Definitive Edition comes with survival mode and a new game plus, but otherwise, it’s the same Wang. I haven’t gotten intimate with this Wang yet, so thankfully, my experience will never not be definitive.

What do you get when you cross a bear with a huge bag of cocaine? Well, the answer&#x27;s yet to be revealed, as the upcoming film Cocaine Bear isn&#x27;t released until February 27. However, in the promotional run-up to its release the movie&#x27;s official Twitter account has unveiled a surprise new game in the form of Cocaine Bear: The Rise of Pablo Escobear.
You play as the bear, in search of red bags of cocaine to help you run faster. The end goal? Catch up to the humans and tear them apart. Delightful, right? This browser-based game requires gamers to be at least 18 to play, which is a much stricter age requirement than Namco&#x27;s original Pac-Man.

                              <span>Wild enough, and a lotta heart
When I first picked up Dynasty Warriors 2 from a Blockbuster Video over two decades ago, I never expected that I&#x27;d play so many Omega Force games throughout my lifetime. The cover called to me like a siren&#x27;s song, and I was introduced to what would become an endless onslaught of hack and slash games pretty much every year from there on out.
But many folks have forgotten that they also helmed the Toukiden series: an action romp planted firmly in the hunting genre. Well, now they&#x27;re back with Wild Hearts, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about it.

                              <span>And you get some cat ears into the bargain, too!
110 Industries&#x27; wild, cyberpunkian adventure Wanted: Dead has been let loose upon the world, exposing its utterly merciless challenge to PC and console players everywhere. As we noted in our review, it&#x27;s a rock-solid title, with precise melee action, spongey enemies, and brutally distanced checkpoints.
The brutal challenge of Wanted: Dead is all part and parcel of the experience, with the default difficulty of &quot;Normal&quot;, an optional &quot;Hard&quot;, and the reward of &quot;Japanese Hard&quot; once you complete the game for the first time. But if you and Lt. Hannah Stone are having too tough a time against the battalion of Trash Mobs thrown your way, then we&#x27;re here to help, with a guide to unlocking a secret &quot;Easy Mode&quot;.
How to unlock &quot;Neko-Chan Mode&quot;
If you want to make Zombie Unit&#x27;s mission a little less suffocating, then get yourself to the Wanted: Dead title screen and simply tap Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, and Right. You should hear an old-school chime, and the save icon will appear in the bottom right of the screen. And, when you next start a New Game, you&#x27;ll have unlocked the &quot;Neko-Chan Mode&quot; option, which reduces the overall difficulty of the game&#x27;s combat.
As a bonus, Hannah Stone will also don a cute pair of cat ears. And why not?
Wanted: Dead is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Anti-piracy coalition ACE cooperated with the authorities to take down the piracy ring.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game&#x27;s season pass. Firaxis&#x27; role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.</span>

                              <span>Sound design is an often overlooked and underappreciated element of many games, but it&#x27;s an element Capcom takes very seriously in Resident Evil 4. As horrific as the game looks, it&#x27;s the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game&#x27;s soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound designer Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they&#x27;re making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that&#x27;s important to the team?
Hiroshi Tamura: For the remake, we wanted to pay great attention to the sound throughout the game…</span>

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…</span>

                              <span>While the other major publishers like Microsoft and Nintendo have only dabbled with virtual reality, Sony is the only one of the big three that seems to consider it a potential avenue for our video game future. The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.

With the Game Boy and GBA libraries getting added to the Switch recently, we&#x27;ve been thinking about all of the games that might be coming our way over the next few months. This, in turn, got us thinking about just how many great first-party games were available on those two systems.
Indeed, we thought along the very same lines when the N64 library was first added to Nintendo Switch Online. Same for the SNES and the NES. And now that we think about it, the first-party lineup was outrageously good for the GameCube also, and the 3DS. And the DS ain&#x27;t no slouch.

The first trailer for the upcoming Tetris movie has fallen into place — and colour us impressed, this looks like it could be a treat. Not only that, we finally have a date for the film, and it releases on 31st March on Apple TV+ (via Entertainment Weekly).
The film is a biopic all about the origins of Tetris and how Henk Rogers (played by Taron Edgerton of Rocketman fame) managed to secure the intellectual property rights for Alexey Pajitnov&#x27;s (played by Nikita Yefremov) game. And this all happens against the backdrop of the Cold War.

                              <span>Based on the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series.
Deathtrap Dungeon: The Interactive Video Adventure is getting a Switch port later this year, developer Branching Narrative Ltd has revealed.
The game originally launched on Steam in 2020, and is based on the sixth gamebook in the beloved Fighting Fantasy series. As you&#x27;d expect, it plays out like a choose-your-own-adventure game with branching narrative paths and choices to make. All the while, your adventure is narrated by the wonderfully talented Eddie Marsan, star of the BBC adaptation of Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell and a major character in Showtime&#x27;s Ray Donovan, plus a whole raft of celebrated Hollywood projects. And Hobbs &amp; Shaw.

Here&#x27;s some balm for your soul on this Thursday morning: there&#x27;s a museum in Japan that aims to reunite people with the Famicom games that they once owned (via Kotaku).
Did you ever scribble your name down on an old game cartridge or box, only to sell it later on? You might just find it at the Named Cassette Museum in Tokyo (Famicom cartridges are known as cassettes in Japan).

The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be coming our way in early April (be sure to check out our release date guide for region specifics) and it certainly looks like we are in for a video game adaptation that actually respects its source material. What a concept!
With every new trailer and poster comes more detailed peeks at Illumination&#x27;s take on The Mushroom Kingdom and all of the familiar faces that we are going to find therein. From series staples down to the more obscure characters, we have been pretty impressed by all of the silver screen tweaks and enhancements made to the appearance of the plumbers and pals. Were they really necessary, though? Are they better than what we get in the Mario games?

The Japanese Splatoon Twitter account shared some clips of the returning favourite — which many fans love, but this beast of a weapon is also bringing back some painful memories from their Splatoon Wii U days. Nintendo UK has also revealed its brand new name — the Kraken Royale.

The genre blend of Metroidvania and Soulslike is a tried and true combination. And it makes sense; two styles of game with a deep focus on exploration and strict difficulty were bound to cross paths. Games like Salt and Sanctuary, Blasphemous, and — of course — Hollow Knight have successfully taken what makes the genres and mashed them into a mini-genre of their own (although some would argue that Dark Souls itself is essentially a Metroidvania already). Debuting developers Mantra and Sinergia Games have thrown their own hat into the ring in the form of Elderand, which further shows why this mix works, even if this particular concoction could do with being more potent.
You take on the role of a nameless hunter who has washed up in a mysterious land with his crew dead and no bearings to work from. This place is filled with a litany of monsters and threats, and throughout your journey, you unravel a tense plot involving a cult, a serpent society, and a village under threat. While the story is a lot easier to follow than its FromSoftware inspirations, Elderand also tells a lot of its story through the use of item descriptions, letters found across the world, and environmental storytelling. Truth be told, the story didn’t do much for us, with a lot of it being omnipresent text flaring onto the screen. However, the worldbuilding impressed us, each of the game&#x27;s areas feels cohesive, and you can really see the effects of events prior to the game beginning.

Nintendo and Illumination certainly aren&#x27;t holding back on the marketing for the Super Mario Bros. Movie. Just a day after they released a throwback video to the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! they&#x27;ve now released some more posters.
This time around we&#x27;ve got the king of the jungle Donkey Kong and another fold out of the mighty Bowser. Squint hard enough at the DK poster and you should be able to see some Mario Kart action in the bottom left. As for the Bowser poster, you can see the penguin army isn&#x27;t a fan of him.

For the first time ever, Blizzard has introduced a new and interactive experience to the world of Overwatch in the form of Loverwatch - Love Never Dies. This strictly non-canonical dating simulator is completely safe for work, unlike many fan creations in the Overwatch universe, and allows the player to interact with either Genji or Mei on romantic occasions set in various recognizable Overwatch map locations.
As a reward for completing the game, exclusive titles and in-game cosmetics will be granted depending on which options you choose. Up for grabs are the Hanzo Cupid&#x27;s Kiss highlight introduction and cute titles which will automatically be applied to players&#x27; accounts.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got no strings on me
There are a lot of reasons I play video games. Sometimes it&#x27;s to escape. Other times, I just want to feel challenged, to feel like I accomplished something for the day. Then there are the games I play out of habit having been introduced to the franchise in my youth. But mostly, I play games to stave off boredom. Because when I&#x27;m bored, I eat, and I don&#x27;t want to boredom eat anymore. So I keep my hands busy with a controller, and my eyes distracted with the colorful images of whatever game I have loaded up on my console. Years ago, I would turn to games like The Sims to keep myself preoccupied, but over the last decade or so, I&#x27;ve found myself turning to a completely different genre of game to beat back the boredom: first-person dungeon crawlers.

                              <span>Disasters ahoy
Artificial Disasters has announced that their “reversed city-builder” Flooded will be washing out to sea on March 15, 2023.
You might be wondering what a “reversed city-builder” means. For me, personally, it brought back memories of calling every single disaster down on my SimCity 2000 creations. However, Artificial Disasters is using the descriptor as a way of explaining the slowly disappearing terrain in Flooded. Don’t get too comfortable with your initial landmass because, over time, it will be washed away. The goal is to place your buildings carefully to escape the approaching waves.

Tied into this are some RTS and rogue-lite elements. There are campaign, quickplay, and endless modes to tackle. The campaign is story-driven, having you build arks to travel the expanding oceans to figure out what is causing them to rise. You’ll have to defend yourself from other survivors out to plunder your settlements because even when faced with the end, humans will always be eager to destroy lives.
City-builders is one of my favorite relaxation genres. However, Flooded looks like it’s aiming to add an element of stress with its constantly ticking countdown. Still, I always enjoy a bit of progress to give a nice framework to the constant people-pleasing. If I have one hang-up, it’s that I’m not crazy about the art style. However, Artificial Disasters is a solo developer effort, and it can be difficult for one person to cover every aspect of design. It’s definitely not a deal-breaker for me..
Flooded hits PC on March 15, 2023. If you’d like to see if it’s your speed, a demo is available via Steam and GOG.

Tomorrow will see Epic Games Store offer up yet another free game for its army of users, with any and all EGS customers able to pick up Daedalic Entertainment&#x27;s quirky strategy sim Warpips for the very agreeable price of Absolutely Nothing. Huh, say it again.
https://youtu.be/hQRwUsxi2Pg
Developed by indie outfit Skirmish Mode Games and originally launched in spring 2022, Warpips is a fast-paced, tug-of-war strategy title, which offers players quick-to-learn, hard-to-master battles that choose to focus on the larger scale of chaos, rather than the time-consuming minutiae of most strategy sims. Warpips tasks players with building up a small army of infantry and vehicles, before diving into bombastic, fast-paced warfare, with a heavy emphasis on damage and destruction.
Sam Fisher need not apply.
Warpips will be available to download, free of charge, from Epic Games Store from February 16-23. Until the end of today, users still have the opportunity to bag themselves current freebie Recipe for Disaster.

The time has come for the peasants to revolt, as Ikki Unite has hit PC.
The original Ikki launched in arcades in 1985 and was quickly followed by a Nintendo Famicom version. The Famicom version is famous for being one of the first games to have had the title of “kusoge” (literal translation: crap game) bestowed upon it. The creation of the kusoge nomenclature has sometimes been attributed to Jun Miura writing about this game, but the origins are a little murky.
It seems like a strange game to return to, but in Japan, kusoge is more celebrated as a shared suffering experience. Ikki’s Famicom iteration actually sold quite well, which only solidified it in the minds of young games.

                              <span>Employees to return to office from spring 2023
Activision Blizzard has confirmed reports that it is mandating a partial return-to-office stipulation for all of its employees from spring of this year. ABK employees will be expected to return to their workplace in April, while Blizzard workers will return in July. King staff returned back in July 2022.
The new mandate, which requests all employees attend their offices for at least three days a week, was first reported by VGC, who noted that disgruntled employees had leaked the news to social media. These employees noted that they are still concerned by the health hazards of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which initially forced the at-home mandate, while one Blizzard employee, @LeastMyHairIsOk, opines that many coworkers find the commute, and…</span>

Ubisoft has announced that its crossover first-person-shooter, XDefiant, will be holding its latest &quot;Insider&quot; playtest this week, giving its dedicated community the first opportunity to check out the crossplay functionality of the incoming military mash-up.
Announced in 2021, XDefiant — previously known as Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant before fans took umbrage to its quippy nature — sees operators from titles such as Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and other UbiShooters battle it out in six-vs-six rat-a-tat-tat action. The title is Ubisoft&#x27;s latest effort to score a piece of the lucrative free-to-play pie, following on from unsuccessful ventures such as Roller Champions, Elite Squad, Hyper Scape, and canned endeavors Ghost Recon Frontline and Project Q.

                              <span>Spring has spranged
Nintendo of Europe has announced via Twitter that the first wave of the previously announced Splatoon 3 DLC will arrive on February 28, 2023. Previously, Nintendo stated that this wave would arrive in Spring, and unless you listen to ground-dwelling marmots, that isn’t until late March.
The first of Splatoon 3’s paid DLC will be coming in two waves. As far as I can tell, this first wave contains the Inkopolis Plaza first seen in the original Splatoon. You’ll be able to see what’s happened in the past 7 or 8 Springs, catch up with the shopkeepers, and even see the Squid Sisters perform when Splatfest rolls around.

That’s cool. That’s weird. I’ve never really thought of a lobby as paid DLC material, but maybe this is just the appetizer. There’s a second wave that will be coming along eventually, and that includes a story campaign that involves Inkopolis Square, the Splatoon 2 hub. I’m going to assume that’s where the meat of this DLC is really going to be, but Nintendo hasn’t done a super-great job of communicating that. Hopefully, we’ll finally get the ability to play as Salmonids.
Splatoon 3 is available right now on Switch. The first wave of DLC hits February 28, 2023, with the second wave coming before the end of the year.

For many, Returnal kind of came and went. Despite some of the hang-ups I had with the launch build, I stuck with it, and it was definitely worth my time. The PC edition not only benefits from a few PC-exclusive graphical tweaks, but the hindsight of fan-demanded features amid the PS5 version&#x27;s patches. In other words, this sci-fi rogue is still worth playing.

Returnal PC version options
Let&#x27;s touch on what the PC version offers first. While PS5 cross-play is notably missing, there&#x27;s support for Ultrawide at 21:9 and Super Ultrawide at 32:9 resolution settings, a DualSense control option, AMD FSR, and Nvidia DLSS.

[Update: The PowerWash Simulator Special Midgar Pack will launch on all platforms March 2, free to all players.]
In a very fun, and very surprising piece of news, goofy window-washer PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab has revealed that it is collaborating with Square Enix on a special Final Fantasy VII DLC expansion, which will see our crew of dirt-blasters head out to the city Midgar for some deep-cleaning action.
The new &quot;Midgar Special Pack&quot; DLC will give PowerWash Simulator players the opportunity to clean up some familiar locales and enemies located around the miserable, smog-covered &#x27;berg, giving the iconic Final Fantasy VII cityscape a sparkly sheen not seen since before the arrival of capitalist scumbags Shinra. Tifa&#x27;s bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud&#x27;s motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona&#x27; and the devastating &quot;Guard Scorpion&quot; robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.

Unfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated &quot;Final Fantasy VII Day&quot;. We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available. In the meantime, you can still go and spruce up Croft Manor for yer gurl Lara.
PowerWash Simulator is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Capcom has released a new trailer for the incoming PSVR2 edition of its blockbuster horror title Resident Evil Village. In addition, the publisher announced that a free demo will be made available alongside the hardware&#x27;s launch, which will take place on February 22.
The VR adaptation of Resident Evil Village will see players going face to face with the horrors of The House Beneviento like never before. Fully immersive 3D technology is expected to bolster the forests, huts, castles, and corridors for maximum player impact, allowing hapless users to come face-to-face with a gallery of infamous and terrifying villains, including Heisenberg, Lady Dimitrescu, and, yes, that baby. No Thank You. Not unless it&#x27;s the puppet versions... I&#x27;d hang out with them all day.

The PlayStation VR 2 technology launches worldwide on February 22, and is hoping to set a new market standard for immersive, responsive, virtual reality hardware. While the technology is unquestionably impressive, the PSVR2 unit&#x27;s exceptionally high price, ($550 USD), will most certainly make it something of a niche purchase within an already niche community. Still, how much do you want to pay for a date with Lady D? Can you put a price on what would surely be the best, and last, night of your life?
Resident Evil Village VR Mode will officially release later in 2023, available as a free download for all Resident Evil Village players.

Somebody deserves a whole stack of lollipops — PlatinumGames has proudly announced that its dazzling hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash sequel Bayonetta 3 has smashed past one million global sales. The long-long-long awaited sequel first launched on Nintendo Switch back in October 2022.
The sales milestone was modestly announced on the official PlatinumGames Twitter account, and sees the popular series&#x27; second sequel become the fastest-selling title of the Bayonetta series. The adventure sees the sultry Umbra Witch take on the powerful &quot;Homunculi&quot; arsenal in an effort to prevent the very tearing of space and time itself. Over the course of the story, Bayonetta is aided by friends from alternate universes, as well as a young witch-in-training known as Viola.

After what seemed like an endless wait for release, Bayonetta 3 finally launched to a mixed, but mostly positive reception from critics and fans. While most everybody was pleased with the iconic and chaotic combat, as well as its seamless integration into the mise-en-scene, many fans were left a little disappointed by the story and the overall character arc for their favorite naughty spellcaster.
The next title in the series will be spin-off release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon. This cutesy-looking title will see the young girl who would eventually become Bayonetta embark upon one of her very first adventures, exploring the Avalon forest alongside her first demon companion, Cheshire. Bayonetta Origins will launch on Nintendo Switch on March 17.
Bayonetta 3 is available right now, exclusively on Nintendo Switch.

Welcome back! It’s time for a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight we’ll be talking all about the magnificent and recently stealth-released Metroid Prime Remastered. Along with that, the team discusses the difference between a remaster and a remake -- And how even game devs are split on the meaning.

I know what you&#x27;re thinking, the difference between a remaster and a remake is clear. A game like Wind Waker HD is a remaster and Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake.

                              <span>Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we&#x27;re curious to see how these other projects fair and if they&#x27;ll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix&#x27;s well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

These triple buffering patches still haven&#x27;t been upstreamed as of the GNOME 44 release due out next month, but the patches continue to be carried within Debian and Ubuntu among other distributions.

We like to call them SSDs, and nowadays you can pick them up for extremely tiny prices. For example, this 240GB SSD from Netac is down to just £14, making it an essential upgrade for any old laptops or desktops sitting around still using mechanical hard drives.

                              <span>It’s probably not a huge surprise to say that Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment’s visually intriguing mystery set in 16th century Bavaria, required a lot of historical research during development. What may surprise you, however, is how deep these historical details run throughout Pentinment’s DNA, right down the game’s text fonts. Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that throwing knives are better than active reload. I enjoyed the spirited discussion over which throwing knives are good and which are bad. I can&#x27;t help but feel active reload didn&#x27;t get a fair shake because so few games do it outside Gears Of War, but the results are science and we must continue. This week, I suppose our choices are both about architecture, but in very different ways. What&#x27;s better: funicular fights or elaborate corridor architecture?

Running a school though? That&#x27;s a challenge I don&#x27;t mind taking on. Twopoint Campus does a great plate-spinning take on a school admin sim, but if you want something with cards, a dark lord, and the option for organic school meals, then... well, then you&#x27;re making a very specific request. But it&#x27;s one I can fulfil with Spellcaster University. And it&#x27;s bloody difficult.

                              <span>Returnal is here on PC and lo and behold, it’s not as scary as it looked. In a hardware demanding, recommended spec kind of way, at least – those lanky alien tree-man enemies are greying what little hair I have left.
Like previous Playstation port Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, it’s not the most easygoing game either, but I’ve cycled through my share of deaths and rebirths and can report that Returnal will make do with older graphics cards and middling RAM counts. It’s a mostly well-considered porting job too, with optional ray tracing, various upscaling tools, ultrawide support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors, and pages upon pages of customisable display and control settings.

                              <span>The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

                              <span>Magic Week could use a dash more dark magic, I reckon. Through The Nightmares may not be about spellcasting and amateur alchemy, but it still draws upon the arcane and otherworldly, setting its deviously difficult action-platforming inside the sleepscapes of frightened children.
You are the Sandman, and you are neither sprinkling happy dust on Danish eyelids nor delivering Liberace-haired boyfriends to vocal quartets. Instead, you’re an active fighter of nightmares, diving into the brains of restless kids to explore their most traumatic memories and, ultimately, defeat the monstrous embodiments of their fears.

                              <span>March is fast approaching, which means we’ll need to say goodbye to another batch of Game Pass games very soon. This month’s list of leavers includes a few heavy hitters, like the horrifying Alien Isolation, and a duo of big JRPGs that are likely impossible to binge in just two weeks.

&quot;Omega Force are working continuously to improve performance and optimise the game for a wide variety of hardware specs across future updates&quot;, the note reads. It also confirms that support for both DLSS and FSR upscalers is on the way, and asks those who’ve found their hunts scuppered by dodgy performance to report their issues to EA’s support team.

                              <span>Loathe as I am to become one of those &quot;want to feel old?&quot; types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era&#x27;s City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother&#x27;s desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it&#x27;s back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the &quot;A New Era&quot; part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s&#x27; extra crunchy. It&#x27;s a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

                              <span>Riot have announced a brand new (previously leaked) League Of Legends spin-off coming this year. The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is a 2D action RPG from Digital Sun, the dev team behind Moonlighter, which was a delightful fusion of roguelike action and shopkeeping. The Mageseeker is launching this spring, while the other LoL spin-offs have also received release windows for 2023.

I first became aware of this upcoming game while covering last summer&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, and I&#x27;ve been itching to write something about it ever since. Happily, as part of RPS Magic Week, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to speak with Florian Mann, CEO and co-founder of Spells &amp; Secrets development team Alchemist Interactive.

Now developer Balancing Monkey is back for another go at spacefaring management, but this time your city is built on top of a space whale, rather than being terrorised by one. Their follow-up, Beyond These Stars, will be hitting early access on PC later this year.

                              <span>I kind of hate mechanical hard drives these days. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap per gigabyte, yes they&#x27;re fairly reliable, yes they&#x27;re absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don&#x27;t care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you&#x27;re used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I&#x27;d bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn&#x27;t have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I&#x27;d made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

                              <span>Guild Wars 2 is over ten years old now, and last year it brought its long-running storyline to a close with its third expansion. Now its developers say they want to release smaller and cheaper expansions more regularly, with quarterly updates filling the gaps in between.

                              <span>Terra Nil is terraforming sim, in which you land on a barren wasteland, construct machines for restoring it to a lush, green wilderness, and then pack up your toys and leave. It&#x27;s one of the games I&#x27;m most looking forward to in 2023, and its latest trailer just cements that. It&#x27;s three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the &quot;satisfaction in reclamation&quot;.

Both seem adorable.

                              <span>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it&#x27;s going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn&#x27;t help feeling like I&#x27;d been left out in the cold.

Thankfully, So May It Be has been my gateway to Witchcraft 101. It’s a sapphic dating sim about a bunch of witches just hanging out doing witchy things. You&#x27;re part of a small coven with your three friends, and you all meet online every night to chat about school, shitty part-time jobs, and of course, witchcraft. At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.

I’m sure Park Beyond will be a wholesome bit of fun - creating outlandish rollercoasters and managing the nuts &amp; bolts of a made-up business is always a good time. But, good grief, there’s something seriously disturbing about its latest trailer.

                              <span>It’s been five whole years since the Firewatch devs announced their tomb-raiding adventure, In The Valley Of Gods, and in that time the idea of the game itself has fossilised. The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo&#x27;s in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s third season is well underway, adding more of the usual maps, modes, and cosmetics. The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

                              <span>Most great platforming games dabble with gravity at some point. It&#x27;s one of those classic, age-old moments where you&#x27;re suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that&#x27;s still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda&#x27;s oeuvre in all the right ways.

That&#x27;s the offer of Dire Decks, a cute little arcade shmup which you can play for free right now in your browser on Itch.io. As you face down endless enemies, you draw and play cards representing individual attacks and power-ups, drafting new and more powerful cards as you level up. I dig it! In another time, this might have been a wee hit Flash game on Newgrounds.

                              <span>I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I&#x27;m guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I&#x27;m sad to report that it isn&#x27;t any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must&#x27;ve gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what&#x27;s arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon&#x27;s Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, &quot;It&#x27;s a no from me&quot;.

The team described Hyper Light Breaker as a co-op roguelike, but the game has now switched to an ambitious, procedurally generated open-world.

                              <span>Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

This is excellent news, as it means you&#x27;ve still got time to give Roots Of Yggdrasil a go, a chill, Viking citybuilder that has such strong Okami vibes with its inky, cell-shaded visuals, strong black outlines, and flute and harp-driven soundtrack that I kept having to remind myself I wasn&#x27;t just playing a spin-off of Clover&#x27;s seminal Zelda-like. I swear, if it weren&#x27;t for the smattering of autumnal trees in the tutorial level, its grassy plains, tall mountains and bright blue river would have been a dead ringer for Okami&#x27;s Kamiki Village.

For the uninitiated, Get In The Car, Loser! begins the way all retro RPGs do, with a group of young misfits who decide to fight a world-ending calamity, or sometimes to fight God. The only difference here is that it’s named after one-of-many iconic Mean Girls quotes, and yes, your party features lesbians. The antithesis of Final Fantasy 15, really.

                              <span>Game developer Bungie has requested a default judgment against the Romanian operator of Veterancheats, who failed to appear in court after being sued two years ago. Cheaters are unskilled and unethical players who ruin games for others, Bungie notes. The company requests over $12 million in damages for the various Destiny 2 hacks the site sold.

                              <span>Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it&#x27;s actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I&#x27;m not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it&#x27;s essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars&#x27; blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it&#x27;s coming out a week early.

But today, the game’s official Twitter announced the zombie slasher had gone gold and would be arriving a week early on April 21st, breaking the decade-long tradition of delay-related news.

This makes it a good opportunity to pick up (often barely) used gear, like headsets, external drives, mice and keyboards, especially higher-end stuff that would otherwise be out of reach.

                              <span>I&#x27;m such a sucker for cartoony animation in games. I’ll play anything that looks like it’s been lovingly hand-drawn and bonus points if the animation is deece. Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.

                              <span>Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it&#x27;s a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where&#x27;s the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we&#x27;re used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

Everything has been made by LGBTQ+ creators and all the proceeds will be split between the featured teams. So far, the bundle has passed a whopping $90,000 (or £74,000) in sales, with over a week left to go.

                              <span>Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don&#x27;t have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don&#x27;t like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin&#x27;s bedroom, or whatever. It&#x27;s the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it&#x27;ll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

                              <span>When I say that Blood Bowl used to be a dead game, Cyanide’s Gautier Brésard is quick to correct me: “I would say that it was a community-managed game.” In fact, for the two decades that the tabletop Warhammer bloodsport was out of print, fans worked diligently to ensure it wasn’t out of mind - creating a ‘living rulebook’ that ran to six iterations.

The book follows three aspiring game developers from their time as kids to their careers in the industry, in part detailing the games they make along the way, and found itself on several best seller lists on its release. Over the weekend, veteran game dev Brenda Romero called out the novel for excluding her from the acknowledgments, despite the similarity, confirmed by the author elsewhere, between Romero’s board game Train and an in-book video game Solution.

Z-Library continued to operate on the dark web and this weekend, reappeared on the clearnet, offering a &#x27;unique&#x27; domain name to all users.

I can&#x27;t get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.

It was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I&#x27;ve had a great time watching the first three so far.

                              <span>Look, I am aware that I am talking a lot about the coming spring. But. Did you know that spring is coming? Because it is. This week I walked through woods shining with snowbells, and my heart soared. And oh, when I saw that crocuses are out in the local park too? Absolute joy. The greatest of thanks to the park gardeners who plant those so we know that spring is coming, please, hold on just a little longer, enjoy these flowers and know that spring is coming. But what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>With a reputation for quality and sporting one of the most recognized brands to ever exist in the pirate IPTV marketplace, a big legal win over PrimeStreams would&#x27;ve been a PR coup for any rightsholder. Instead, two PrimeStreams-related lawsuits worth tens of millions in damages were quietly settled this week, despite what appeared to be a mountain of evidence. So what went wrong?

                              <span>2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine&#x27;s studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2&#x27;s tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft&#x27;s acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we&#x27;re excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…</span>

The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. 
Pacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued. In a way, Pacific Drive is a racing game, but you’re not racing against other players – you’re racing against a biome ravaged by a mysterious sci-fi force that controls anomalies set on…</span>

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>The makers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide have laid out their plans to improve the co-op shooter&#x27;s shopping and crafting systems. The gear system changes, due to arrive in the next patch, do sound like improvements to the current state of things. These plans do not sound better than entirely ending the tedious grinds of random rolls and making numbers bigger. Why improve when it would be better to remove?

                              <span>For three hours, Re:Call was high on my list of surprise recent indie hits. It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the &#x27;correct&#x27; solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

                              <span>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been bouncing between a lot of weighty games lately, but I&#x27;ve found a great diversion in The True Slime King, a simple three button platformer that recently left early access.

Speaking pedantically, this isn&#x27;t &quot;as simple as it gets&quot;, but you&#x27;ll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I&#x27;ve played enough to realise I&#x27;m partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

                              <span>The Division 2 has enjoyed a long life since its 2019 release, but it seems like the looter shooter has finally tripped. Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.

                              <span>I imagine Industries Of Titan started out as an ambitious concept. A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it&#x27;s incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it&#x27;s tragic that its final design just doesn&#x27;t work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

It&#x27;s meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

                              <span>Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright&#x27;s new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

Valve’s hero shooter has been in maintenance mode for a few years, only receiving seasonal updates and patches to fix exploits and fight bots. So, judging by Valve’s “bleeding-edge communication” blog post, this will be the game’s first major content update in years.

There&#x27;s your chill little potion brewers that let you coo over a bubbling cauldron all nice and cosy like; there&#x27;s your darker, more supernatural witchy adventures that dig into the spookier side of the fae realm, and then you&#x27;ve got your lovely genre mash-ups that add spicy, magical seasoning to well-worn action tropes, like the excellent bullet-hell Metroid-like The Knight Witch I wrote about the other day. But if I thought that was pushing against my limits of gamepad dexterity, Contingent99&#x27;s 2018 roguelike Wizard Of Legend is on another level entirely.

                              <span>Katharine and I were lamenting earlier today that Square Enix seem inconsistent when it comes to releasing demos of their games on Steam. Forspoken&#x27;s demo only came to PC months after its console release, and Harvestella&#x27;s demo remains exclusive to Switch. Likewise, the Octopath Traveler 2 demo which was released on console yesterday was nowhere to be found on PC.

Uh, until today. It&#x27;s out on Steam now.

                              <span>Razer&#x27;s Nari Essential headset is a nice wireless option, with oversized and super-comfy ear cushions, a THX spatial audio certification and a relatively sturdy design. It retailed at $100, half the price of the ultra-premium Nari Ultimate, but today it&#x27;s significantly cheaper at Best Buy. You&#x27;ll pay just $35 for it now, a $65 discount and a great deal for an older but still great-sound wireless headset.

                              <span>Kingston&#x27;s 1TB DataTraveler Max USB-C flash drive is an unusual beastie, matching NVMe-SSD-grade speeds with a slim, portable flash drive form factor. This drive is capable of reads up to 1000MB/s, putting it alongside some of the best external SSDs, and it&#x27;s currently discounted at B&amp;H Photo Video to $80 for a 1TB size - not bad! 
Unfortunately this deal is only live for the next six hours, so I hope that you see this post in time!

                              <span>The Etrian Odyssey series is a huge blindspot for me, and I imagine many others. They&#x27;re a series of dungeon crawling JRPGs in which you pilot a party of adventures through first-person, grid-based mazes and turn-based battles. Now is your chance to fill the gap in your knowledge: the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection is headed to PC on June 1st.

                              <span>GitHub and digital rights group EFF have filed briefs supporting stream-ripping site Yout.com in its legal battle with the RIAA. GitHub warns that the lower court&#x27;s decision threatens to criminalize the work of many other developers. The EFF, meanwhile, stresses that an incorrect interpretation of the DMCA harms people who use stream-rippers lawfully.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew excitedly outlines a few big reveals from yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, including flying machines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a collection of Game Boy games being released on Nintendo Switch yesterday alongside a surprise launch of Metroid Prime Remastered. Following news of a canceled single-player Titanfall game set in its shared universe with Apex Legends, the guys speculate about what happened to the project and share their ideas for what the game could&#x27;ve looked like. 
During The Playlist, we discuss the first hour of Octopath Traveller II, Goldeneye 007, Metroid Prime Remastered, and The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap.

Turns out Metroid Prime is still great and only improved by the visual upgrade and modernized contols.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Ge…</span>

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector&#x27;s Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.</span>

By now, Nintendo has brought a large chunk of its most popular and successful games of all time to Switch. Whether you&#x27;re talking the enhanced ports like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD or the collection of emulated classics available through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription tiers, the Switch has rightfully earned its reputation as a place where you can experience both the newest titles from Nintendo, as well as many of its greatest hits. The latest title to time travel to Nintendo&#x27;s modern juggernaut system is Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land, a 2011 Wii title from HAL Laboratory.

                              <span>Professor Layton is making a comeback in a new adventure for Switch. Called Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, the next chapter in his saga will arrive at a yet-to-be-specified date.
A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don&#x27;t know what mystery he&#x27;ll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it&#x27;s nice to see the good gentleman back. 


Professor Layton&#x27;s last title to star him was 2014&#x27;s The Azaran Legacy. In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton&#x27;s daughter called Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires&#x27; Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo announced a new Samba de Amigo game today during its most recent Direct live stream. Samba de Amigo: Party Central will be released this summer.
Party Central will feature 40 songs &quot;from across the world’s most popular music genres.&quot; Players use the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers in rhythm with the beat. The game will also have local and online competitive multiplayer and party modes. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


Samba de Amigo: Party Central is actually a sequel to the first Samba de Amigo, developed by Sonic Team and first released on the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. It&#x27;s since been ported to the Wii (though it wasn&#x27;t very good) and had a long life in arcades.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, we saw plenty of new footage of one of the most anticipated games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While you can read all about that right here, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017&#x27;s Breath of the Wild.
First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector&#x27;s Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector&#x27;s Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link&#x27;s paraglider.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.</span>

Alongside the trailer, however, Nintendo also released a new batch of official screenshots which features a collection of alternate paragliders alongside other details. The new paragliders are apparently related to the game&#x27;s amiibo compatibility which according to a press release, &quot;Will also be available separately that grants access to materials and weapons, as well as a special fabric for Link’s paraglider.&quot; You can check out some examples in the gallery below.

                              <span>Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon got its first gameplay showcase after its reveal at the Game Awards last December. This storybook-themed adventures stars a young Bayonetta on a quest to free her imprisoned mother.
Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won&#x27;t be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she&#x27;ll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles. 


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon comes to Switch on March 17.</span>

You&#x27;re going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there&#x27;s rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great. 
Here&#x27;s the trailer:


While we&#x27;re at it, here&#x27;s a whole host of new screenshots.

                              <span>The Adata XPG SX8200 Pro was one of the best value NVMe SSDs when it launched in 2019 - and indeed, we have the RPS review from erstwhile hardware editor Katharine to prove it. Nowadays, PCIe 4.0 drives are becoming more common and PCIe 5.0 is on the horizon, but the SX8200 Pro - in a newer 2TB size - is still an awesome value for the performance on offer. It&#x27;s down to £117 at TechNextDay when you use code TND-10, a healthy £35 below the next-lowest price at CCL.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Arc graphics cards debuted to surprisingly warm reviews late last year, including over at Digital Foundry where I endorsed them as a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; that were &quot;already cards worth buying&quot; thanks to better-than-expected performance in modern titles. Six months of patches and performance improvements later, and these GPUs look even better - especially as neither AMD or Nvidia has launched mainstream desktop graphics cards from their most recent generation. 
 Today, the cheaper of the two cards, the Arc A750, is available for £250 plus shipping at Overclockers UK, a steep £80 reduction from their £330 launch price.

                              <span>Atomic Heart looks like an exceptionally shiny first-person shooter in the vein (geddit?) of Metro, which suggested that its system requirements might be the sort to bleed (geddit) your machine or your wallet dry. Not so, it turns out. The target specs have been released today and they&#x27;re relatively modest at both the low and high end.

It was confirmed last night during the surprisingly PC-relevant Nintendo Direct. A remaster will come to Steam this summer.

                              <span>Although the demo is relatively short, I’ve really been getting into the roguelike deckbuilding of Dungeon Drafters. I like the colourful pixel art, the classic fantasy enemy archetypes, how spell cards feel super punchy when activated, and I love love love the magical, fluffy wizard rabbit. 
Called The Explorer, this rabbit is not only super cute - his little brown booties are adorable, as is his helmet which has holes so his massive fluffy ears can poke through - but a bonafide badass in magic casting. This rabbit can majorly throw down.

The series is still going strong at Ubisoft, but its original creator Volker Wertich is returning to the genre with Pioneers Of Pagonia, a similar city-building sim. The game is currently in development at indie studio Envision Entertainment and it’ll be entering early access on Steam by the end of this year.

This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss the recent sunetting of Rumbleverse and Knockout City, and how long is a good run for games anyway? But in happier and more ridiculous news, we also get to talk about how massively popular Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s steam release has been. Good ol&#x27; Dwarf Fortress. Plus: the Dreadwolf is leeeeeaaakiiiiing.
Nate&#x27;s mini-game this week is offering us both dark bargains (I think I did pretty well out of mine), and in a Good Day To Ware Hard James explains why the graphics card market is broken, with a cowboy metaphor. This is a thing now.

                              <span>A lot (most) of the magic games we&#x27;re highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It&#x27;s nice that witches have changed in our minds to &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]&quot;, when they used to be &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil&quot;.
There&#x27;s still room for witches with some threat to &#x27;em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It&#x27;s a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. &quot;In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,&quot; solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. &quot;During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one&#x27;s home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.&quot;

                              <span>We’ve all been busy here at RPS picking out our favourite demos in this spring’s Steam Next Fest. Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.
I thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it&#x27;s actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain&#x27;s Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.

That was a mistake, since their newest story-focused adventure Harmony: The Fall Of Reverie looks amazing. Best of all, it’s coming to PC and consoles this June.

Finally, there’s a high-end, DLSS 3-capable, Ada Lovelace architecture-based graphics card that doesn’t cost four figures.

                              <span>Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.</span>

                              <span>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn&#x27;t happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay &quot;in light of recent world events,&quot; perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It&#x27;s being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.</span>

                              <span>Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.
Check out the new trailer below.</span>

The trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.
The trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.</span>

The news comes by way of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It&#x27;s up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

                              <span>Nintendo leveraged today’s Nintendo Direct as a chance to provide a new glimpse at Pikmin 4. Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.
We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.
Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo announced today plans for a paid expansion pass for Splatoon 3. The first of two planned waves will be available spring of this year. It will allow players to hang out in Inkopolis from the original Splatoon game, and even meet and interact with characters from the original game, like the Squid Sisters, who will perform during Splat Fests.
No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.


The Splatoon 3 expansion pass will be available to pre-purchase today.</span>

                              <span>&quot;Honestly speaking, I didn&#x27;t want to do it.&quot;
Those were the words of Capcom&#x27;s Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game&#x27;s magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game&#x27;s development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team&#x27;s approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. 
Ampo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil. Their combined credits span the original 1996 game to titles such as Res…</span>

                              <span>Ever since the first bundle arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don&#x27;t know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.
The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken players still exploring Athia or those hoping to jump in the future should be happy to know that developer Luminous Productions has announced an impending patch to make the adventure smoother across the board. 
In a statement by game director Takeshi Aramaki, the update will improve Forspoken’s graphics, performance, and playability while also adding “general updates” and fixes to both the PS5 and PC versions. There&#x27;s no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. 
“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
Forspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken&#x27;s story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I&#x27;m eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.</span>

                              <span>To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn&#x27;t detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.
This new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.
Perhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don&#x27;t already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.
You can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.


Cities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here.

It&#x27;s a chill, citybuilding puzzle game from the devs behind the altogether more violent Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and it&#x27;s all about building tiny little villages on top of rocky outcrops. Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It&#x27;s very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.

                              <span>Another month, another fresh batch of Game Pass goodies. February’s PC Game Pass additions have plenty of variety and should appeal to fans of the following subjects: American ‘football’, the Dark Ages, stabbing Japanese demons, and shooting Soviet robots. February’s Game Pass picks kick off tomorrow with the online action-RPG SD Gundam Battle Alliance, and EA’s Madden NFL 23 - which corrupted a number of players’ saves last month.

                              <span>Bullet hell shooters have never been one of my fortes in games. There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It&#x27;s a fantastic little game, and I&#x27;m only sorry we didn&#x27;t cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.

                              <span>Apex Legends is going to look a little different in a week&#x27;s time. Respawn have broken the mould a little bit with Apex Legends Revelry and the game&#x27;s four year anniversary - instead of adding a new Legend as usual, they&#x27;ve spent their time elsewhere to bring a host of Legend meta and weapon meta changes, alongside the new Team Deathmatch game mode and improving player onboarding that we reported on earlier in the week.
Apex Legends Season 16 is going to break a surprising number of targeted adjustments to various different guns, Legends, and abilities. And all that on top of the entirely revamped Legend class system, which gives every Legend a brand new perk (or in some cases two!) to play with. Read on for a full list of all the major changes that are coming to Legends and weapons with Apex Legends Revelry.

                              <span>As part of Steam Next Fest, I gave pixel-art, sidescrolling fantasy RPG Greedventory a go. It takes your mouse and turns it into a sword, or a shield, or an arm that&#x27;s capable of swatting away an explosive potion. It may be like something you, dear reader, have played in the past, but me? Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that&#x27;s a lie. If anything, it&#x27;s the first fantasy RPG that&#x27;s made use of my latent - and highly dubious - CS:GO skills and brought to mind a rhythm game called Osu! I am very impressed indeed.

                              <span>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have released their provisional findings on Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, laying out their concerns with the $69 billion deal. The CMA say the buyout “could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers.” Since these concerns are provisional, both parties will have a chance to respond before the CMA makes its final decision on April 26th. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.

Deliver Us Mars follows in the footsteps of hidden gem Deliver Us The Moon, a game with enjoyable puzzle-solving and storytelling that mostly overcame its technical and presentational shortcomings. The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.   
Despite being a direct sequel, you don’t need to play Deliver Us The Moon to grasp Mars’ plot. Earth has spiraled into an irreve…</span>

                              <span>A new Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, February 8, at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. 
Tune in at 2 p.m. PST tomorrow, Feb. 8, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023.

February 7, 2023
The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it&#x27;s always possible they&#x27;ll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow&#x27;s Direct? Let us know in the comments.</span>

This new mixed-reality racing game comes by way of a collaboration with toy maker Mattel, playing off the experience the studio accrued through past games.
Much like Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally comes with a physical remote-controlled car, as well as physical course-creation elements, allowing players to design their own tracks within their house and race using the device&#x27;s camera. The aptly named Chameleon physical RC car used for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally can digitally transform into more than 140 different vehicle variations, including iconic Hot Wheels vehicles like Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Mach Speeder, and more.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is prepping for release on February 10, but the provided review code allowed for a review embargo that was lifted earlier today. After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.
In that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix. For gamers familiar with the books or movies, it’s great fun to explore the massive cast…</span>

                              <span>After spending a couple of years coming together in early access, Darkest Dungeon II is ready to go 1.0 this May. Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.
Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.
Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. 
You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store. To learn more, check out our feature on the game&#x27;s new hero, the Runaway and a list of its most challenging enemies thus far.</span>

                              <span>After its launch in October of last year, Overwatch 2 is ready to kick off its third season of content on February 7. This season delivers several facets of new content, including a new Antarctica Control map, Asian Mythology theme, and a Kiriko Mythic skin. On top of that, Blizzard announced some unexpected additions to its Overwatch offerings, including the first IP collaboration as well as a web-based game to coincide with Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Antarctica joins the map rotation in Season 3. While players are already familiar with Earth&#x27;s least-populated continent through Ecopoint: Antarctica, this map features unique locations, including an ice-breaker ship and an underground drilling station. The map allows players to take the high-ground or sneaky flank routes to reach their objectives.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Grammy awards ceremony was the first ever to include a category for the best score soundtrack for a video game, and last year&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla expansion, Dawn of Ragnarok, took home the win. 
More specifically, the DLC&#x27;s composer, Stephanie Economou, won the Grammy for her score in the game. Her other credits include Netflix&#x27;s Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked &quot;all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,&quot; thanking them for &quot;acknowledging and validating the power of game music.&quot; 


Variety also reports that prior to this year&#x27;s Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show&#x27;s score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012&#x27;s Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Economou&#x27;s Grammy was awarded during the main show&#x27;s pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game&#x27;s name last night is any indication.

This news comes from a new gameplay reveal trailer that confirms Nina Williams as a playable fighter in the forthcoming game alongside footage of some new and returning moves.

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
