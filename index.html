                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie&#x27;s swansong for the Halo franchise: Halo Reach.
Halo Reach launched on September 14, 2010, for Xbox 360 and served as a prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved. Set on the doomed planet Reach, players control a new member of the Spartan Noble Team as they valiantly defend the human-occupied world from a massive Covenant invasion. The time and setting gave Bungie creative freedom to introduce new characters and flesh out an event that had only been referenced in books, while the multiplayer introduced new (though divisive) mechanics such as armor abilities. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Polygon&#x27;s Mike Mahardy (@mmahardy) as we unpack the history and impact of Halo&#x27;s most emotionally charged entry to that point. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

Next week marks the return of the cult classic Shadow Man, and ahead of its release, the tech experts at Digital Foundry have gone hands-on with the game.
This remaster, as you might already know, has been done by the talented team at Nightdive - the same studio behind the re-release of Turok 2, and is running on the company&#x27;s KEX 4 game engine.

The Switch is expected to have a very exciting year in 2022, so apart from offerings like Zelda, what else is there to anticipate?

                    <span>He is the &#x27;Game Boy&#x27; Boy.
Some people are blessed with all the talent, and one of those people is Andy Sexton, who&#x27;s not only content with being the Creative Director at Hi-Rez Studios (Smite, Paladins) — he&#x27;s also a very good Game Boy modder in his free time.
We can&#x27;t be too mad, though, because he also takes wonderful photos of those mods and shares them on the internet. Also, he was nice to us on Twitter... so we&#x27;ll give you a pass, Andy. For now.

Take the farming and house decorating of Stardew Valley, the dungeon crawling of Minish Cap, and combine it with RPG deckbuilding combat in a beautifully-rendered top-down pixel world, and you have Moonstone Island — a game that&#x27;s very quickly shot up on our &quot;ones to watch&quot; list.
You are an alchemist-in-training, spending a year in the wilderness to master your arcane techniques, and to figure out how to restore Moonstone Island, and the town, to their former glory. You travel around by balloon, broom, and glider to access over 120 procedurally-generated sky islands, populated by monsters to fight and dungeons to explore. You can even set up your home on any one of the islands, in any one of the biomes!

                    <span>THE NUMBERS, MASON! WHAT DO THEY MEAN!
If there’s one Nintendo franchise that has desperately needed a new entry in modern times, it’s Picross. Just nine months on from S6, barely five months since the SEGA-flavoured Picross S Genesis &amp; Master System edition, and after the thrilling cliffhanger ending, we’ve been eager to see how Jupiter would tie up this epic &#x27;S&#x27; saga it’s been building for the past few years. The plot has taken some very bizarre turns along the way—that arc where Shigeru Miyamoto and the crew split off from the main party to join the neighborhood soapland was as disturbing as it was entertaining—but we’re happy to report that Picross S7 is packed full of callbacks to all your favorite characters from the Picross universe. Newcomers like “Sponge Cake” and “Wheat” add a lot to the cast, too, while mainstays like “Scuba” and “Euphonium” get the payoff they always deserved...
This is complete nonsense, of course. Every Picross game up till now has been nothing more than a new pack of a few hundred more nonogram puzzles to add to the massive pile of existing ones from previous games that you keep telling yourself you’ll ‘get around to’ one of these days. Let’s be real, you’ll never go back to those previous entries, and you can be just as sure that still isn’t going to stop you from buying this new entry. Why, you ask? Simple. Because this is more Picross, but with touch controls!

Last year, as part of its 40th-anniversary celebrations, Nihon Falcom announced it would localise another four games from the Legend of Heroes RPG series for Nintendo Switch. One of these was The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero, which is due to arrive in Fall 2022.

                    <span>What are your gaming plans?
Another week down in this new and mysterious year of 2022. This week we got a new trailer and a March release date for the lovely-looking Kirby and the Forgotten Land, news hit of Among Us getting a manga, the fifth anniversary of the very first time we went hands-on with Switch came (and we all got teary-eyed looking back five years to a time when we could meet in a pub and only have to worry about rowdy patrons), and one Thomas Whitehead went on a deep dive exploring the ins and outs of NFTs and the implications for gaming. Tom, we salute you, sir!
Anyhoo, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

                    <span>&quot;what sort of wizardry is this?&quot;.
The Game Boy Advance - a 32-bit handheld system released in 2001 - managed to get some 3D-like games up and running, but we don&#x27;t think we ever saw one that looked this amazing during its lifetime.
Presenting &#x27;OpenLara&#x27; - aka the original Tomb Raider game running on the Game Boy Advance. It&#x27;s currently in alpha, but as you can see it&#x27;s perhaps some of the best-looking 3D ever shown on the system. Even the framerate is quite impressive.

Update : In an update via social media, Krysta has announced she has decided to move on from Nintendo. Here&#x27;s her full statement:

&quot;After over 14 years, I&#x27;ve decided to leave Nintendo. To be able to work at my dream job for so long and be part of some of the most memorable moments in gaming has truly been incredible. But the best part was all the people that I&#x27;ve had the privilege to work with.

                    <span>Last November, Q-Games announced that its shuttered collaborative multiplayer game The Tomorrow Children would be rising from the grave. We still don&#x27;t know when players will be able to resume building islands as unsettling doll-like characters, but players have a chance to contribute something new to the experience thanks to a new contest.
Q-Games&#x27; contest invites players to design an island of their own from scratch. You see, The Tomorrow Children is all about working alongside players to rebuild the world, known as The Void, after a neo-Soviet experiment goes awry. Landmasses take the form of islands and, to promote the game&#x27;s spirit of contribution, one of these could be custom-made by you. 
No game development experience is necessary. If you have the imagination and some decent artistic chops, you&#x27;re as qualified as any other entrant. Your concept can be a drawing, a 3D model, or whatever visual representation you prefer. There are some rules to note, which you can read in full here. The major stipulations are that the winners won&#x27;t be paid for this, and they&#x27;ll surrender claims to any intellectual rights their creation. Winners will be included in the game&#x27;s credits, however. It probably goes without saying that designs featuring plagiarized elements or are overtly violent and/or sexual will be disqualified.
You can submit entries beginning today by visiting the contest&#x27;s website. Submissions close on February 1, and Q-Games will announce the winners on July 15. Given that timeframe, it&#x27;s likely The Tomorrow Children won&#x27;t be relaunching during the first half of the year. We&#x27;ll have to see if it makes it out again before the end of 2022 and if it will remain a PlayStation exclusive now that Q-Games has regained the rights. 
What do you think of this contest? Are you interested in entering? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Last month, due to the overwhelming queue times to access Final Fantasy XIV servers, digital game sales and certain services were suspended until things calmed down. Now, Square Enix is preparing to allow fresh accounts to be created in a couple of weeks.
According to a developer blog post, January 25 will be the date digital sales of Final Fantasy XIV will be resumed. The move coincides with the already-planned opening of a new Oceanian data center, bringing five new worlds into existence, hopefully alleviating congestion on other worlds. This also means the suspended Home World Transfer Service will also be brought back on January 25, letting players bring their character to these new servers, or elsewhere barring any limitations imposed on still-overpopulated worlds.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon.

                    <span>In what feels like a rare positive update regarding supply in the tech sector, Valve has announced its delivery estimations of the Steam Deck are currently on track. The update, which was posted on the Steam Community site, gives the good news that the first batch of handheld PCs will ship in late February.
By now, we&#x27;re all well versed in supply chain issues, challenges presented by working remotely during the pandemic, and chip shortages, some of which did delay the Steam Deck once from its original launch window. Valve says that&#x27;s not going to be the case again, at least for the first batch of devices, saying, &quot;it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February.&quot; If you happen to have a preorder down on a Deck, you can check your personal delivery date on the Steam Deck store page here.
Work on identifying which games will work best on the Steam Deck is also well underway. The blog post says, &quot;In parallel, work and testing for the Steam Deck Verified program has been underway. You’ll soon be able to see Deck Verified status for a growing set of Steam games. We’re checking four major categories: input, seamlessness, display, and system support.&quot; Knowing which games will work on your shiny new hardware will be invaluable, especially for early adopters testing the limits of their Steam library, so it&#x27;s nice to see this filtering feature isn&#x27;t a post-launch afterthought.
If you&#x27;re curious what the Steam Deck is, we have you covered! Check out this quick rundown of the specs announced for Valve&#x27;s upcoming portable device.</span>

                    <span>The reveal of Dune: Spice Wars was an unexpected treat during The Game Awards 2021. The upcoming game reunites the long-running (and newly relevant) sci-fi property with the genre it helped popularize: 4x strategy. Fans have patiently waited for more details about the game and got their wish thanks to a developer FAQ on the game’s Steam page.
Developer Shiro Games answered some common questions about the title. It clarifies that Spice Wars is a combination of 4x and real-time strategy elements that includes, among other things, base-building. The game has been developed from the ground up, meaning it won’t feature any elements from Shiro’s previous strategy game, Northgard. Maps will also be procedurally generated and sport a variety of unique traits players can tinker with. 
Shiro Games previously announced two playable factions: House Harkonnen and House Atreides. It plans to have two more factions at launch and a 5th house during Early Access. Shiro wants to remain faithful to the book series first and foremost, stating that houses that appeared in prior Dune games but not in the source materials, such as House Ordos, aren’t guaranteed to return in Spice Wars.

Other nuggets include confirmation of multiplayer and plans to add a campaign at some point in Early Access. Shiro is also open to the idea of adding mod support depending on the level of demand. 
Dune: Spice Wars is slated to launch in PC Early Access sometime this year, but Shiro will be eyeing other platforms after launch, so don’t rule out an eventual console release.
Be sure to visit the full FAQ to see if your burning questions have been addressed. If they haven’t, don’t despair. Shiro Plans to provide additional gameplay updates throughout the coming months.</span>

In gruff moments of fatherly instruction, Kratos repeats the phrase “be better” to his son, Atreus. This happens in different contexts, but the lesson remains consistent: Your decisions are not bound by precedent, and the choices of others are not examples to follow – they only set standards you can strive to exceed. In developing the latest God of War, Sony’s Santa Monica studio apparently took this message to heart. While previous games in this series es…</span>

                    <span>We try to make sense of blockchain technology in games.
If there&#x27;s a topic that&#x27;s led to consistent debate and occasional toxicity in online gaming discourse over the past few months, it&#x27;s NFTs. Non-fungible tokens aren&#x27;t actually particularly new to early adopters of blockchain technologies, but 2021 was the year when they broke into mainstream media and conversations around arts and entertainment. From fine art auctions to in-game cosmetics, NFTs became a hot topic in conversations also focused on blockchain technology and ties to cryptocurrencies.
You don&#x27;t need to look far online to find passionate arguments for and against NFTs, though such is the fervour of the debate that at times it can feel like facts and realities get set aside. For example, arguments against often cite environmental factors and cryptocurrency issues, which aren&#x27;t necessarily applicable to all NFTs. On the other side, some defending the concept blithely disregard all genuine issues. Overall, it&#x27;s rarely a civil or calm debate.

                    <span>...if you&#x27;re willing to put up with some issues, that is.
Everyone seems to be talking about retro gaming handhelds these days, thanks in no small part to the long-awaited release of the gorgeous Analogue Pocket. Boasting FPGA power, a sleek design and fantastic screen, it&#x27;s little wonder that this portable gem is in high demand – and some people who have placed orders this year are being told they will have to wait until 2023 to get their hands on one. Eek.
If you&#x27;re tempted to splash $200 on an Analogue Pocket but don&#x27;t fancy waiting that long (or suffering a drop in overall quality) then there&#x27;s no shortage of vastly cheaper emulation-based handhelds on the market, the latest of which is the Miyoo Mini. While the name &#x27;Miyoo&#x27; might not be instantly familiar, this Chinese company has pumped out plenty of similar products under different brands, including BittBoy and PocketGo. The Miyoo Mini feels like an evolution of the former, taking inspiration from the iconic Game Boy design.

Sega has registered a new &#x27;Sega NFT&#x27; trademark in Japan despite the company being seemingly undecided on its future plans.
The trademark, spotted by VGC, was applied for in December 2021 and published today by the Japan Patent Office. It includes an image that appears to be a new logo for Sega&#x27;s NFT business.

Nintendo has published a statement warning consumers of fake web pages designed to look like the company&#x27;s online store, highlighting the dangers of submitting your details to such sites.
The statement (Japanese) talks about a specific case recently discovered by the company; the fake website in question uses Nintendo&#x27;s logo illegally, making it appear as if it&#x27;s the real deal, and offers Nintendo Switch products at discounted prices. It&#x27;s warned that the fake site, which has not been linked to, has &quot;nothing to do&quot; with Nintendo.

                    <span>Well, there&#x27;s Norway we saw this coming.
Look, we know everyone has already collected all the Pinchcliffe Grand Prix memorabilia there is to collect. We&#x27;re sure that as you read this you’re sitting there in your Pinchcliffe Grand Prix pyjamas and shaking with fear at the prospect of buying another piece of Pinchcliffe merchandise, because your partner has threatened to throw you out if you dare add any more objects to the seven rooms of Pinchcliffe tat you’ve already filled to bursting. Worry not, though, because at least this one’s available digitally, meaning you can add to your brimming collection without taking up any more valuable space in your home.
If you’ll allow us to take our sarcastic tongue out of our cheek now, the reality is that Pinchcliffe Grand Prix is actually a big deal in some parts of the world, especially its native Norway. Released in 1975, the film is the most widely seen Norwegian movie of all time.

                    <span>Artist&#x27;s nostalgic blasts are a viral hit.
Ever wondered what more recent entries in the Pokémon franchise would look like if they&#x27;d released back in the 1990s on the good old Game Boy Color? Well, wonder no more, as talented pixel artist Sindorman has tweeted out a couple of fantastic recreations of some early moments from 2019&#x27;s Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield, painstakingly remade in Photoshop to make it seem as though they&#x27;re playing out on Nintendo&#x27;s 24-year-old handheld.
As reported by Dextero, Sindorman has been showing off his skills as a pixel Pokémon artist in a series of tweets depicting a handful of early sequences from Sword &amp; Shield, the first of which shows a trainer choosing their starter Pokémon in the Galar region of the game. Just look at how cute Scorbunny, Sobble and Grooky look here, and Hop is really rocking that &#x27;90s pixel style:

                    <span>Popularity, I have learned from American teen television shows, isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. While Square Enix haven&#x27;t been bombed by the local mafioso, joined a murderous D&amp;D cult, or discovered their dad is a serial killer and they too have the serial killer genes (thanks, Riverdale!), they did find such overwhelming success with Final Fantasy XIV that they temporarily stopped selling the MMORPG. They couldn&#x27;t expand servers quickly enough to meet demand, see, leading to login queues and frustration. But now things are settling enough to to start selling it again, and they have big plans to expand servers.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure I trust the Page of Cups. As imagined by Pamela Colman Smith and A.E. Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he&#x27;s a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There&#x27;s a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.
When drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind&#x27;s ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he&#x27;s been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law&#x27;s Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I&#x27;m doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”

                    <span>Puzzle games don&#x27;t need a plot, or even a theme or setting. When very abstracted ones throw one in it&#x27;s often an indulgence, or just an excuse to hang the aesthetics around something the devs happen to like. Blink Planets seemed like this at first, and that was fine! A little sexy hexy is all you really need if it&#x27;s done right, after all. I cannot believe I just said that.


Partway through though, I realised Blink Planets isn&#x27;t just about connecting things with lines of tiles. It really is about the urban planning its setting suggests.

                    <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia quietly announced a kind of DLSS-adjacent downsampling tech: Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR). It aims to improve image sharpness and quality on GeForce RTX graphics cards, using AI to reduce the performance loss of Nvidia’s existing DSR feature, and it’s now available to install and enable through GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.23.

                    <span>Over the holidays, I decided to treat myself to the gift of funk, and bought myself a neat little acoustic bass. The guitar arrived as promised; I am still waiting on the funk. Any day now. In the meantime, I’ve taught myself the riff for Valley Of The Fallen Star, better known as the Cosmo Canyon theme from Final Fantasy VII. I’m not sure if I can adequately put into words how the original composition of the track makes me feel, but I am certain I’m not the only one.It is sonic nostalgia for a simpler time, where following a talking dog’s weeble uncle to the projection of the cosmos he kept in his loft did nothing to shatter my emotional investment in a story.

So hey, look, here&#x27;s Democracy 4, the latest in the government simulator series from Positech Games. After 15 months in early access, it&#x27;s now out in full: a detailed model of how Positech think politics works, for you to try to gain and keep power.

                    <span>Fear not the fate of the Steam Deck, Valve’s ambitious, SteamOS-based handheld gaming PC. While the Deck’s release date was originally planned for sometime in December 2021, a Steam Community update from Valve has assured that they’re on track for the rescheduled launch next month.


“First and foremost, we’re on track to ship Steam Deck on time. Global pandemic, supply issues, and shipping issues notwithstanding, it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February”, so says the post.

                    <span>Správa specializovaných zásad webového aplikačního firewallu (WAF), které zajišťují trvale robustní zabezpečení aplikací, je práce na plný úvazek. Organizace, které si nemohou dovolit plně spravované podnikové řešení nebo zaměstnávat potřebné zdroje, mají problém udržet si přehled o nejnovějších útocích a ochranných opatřeních potřebných k zajištění konzistentního zabezpečení a shody s předpisy. Podle Johna Breedena II, Barracuda CSO Online, Barracuda WAF as-a-Service rozhodně není jen obyčejný firewall. Toto cloudové zabezpečení aplikací ochrání firemní data, její reputaci a pomáhá zajistit shodu s předpisy.</span>

PlayStation invites you to take a lap around the Daytona International Speedway in this new in-game footage of Gran Turismo 7.
Polyphony Digital is a master of details, and this sub-four-minute clip is full of them. Starting out in a first-person driver view, we take in the little odds and ends around the dash of the vehicle, including the actively-updating stats on the steering wheel display. The shadows and light, both direct and bounce lighting, are on full display in this view as well, not to mention the materials and textures of objects like the driver&#x27;s gloves and the various metals and plastics in view.
Pulling out to camera shots outside of the car, we see the models of the vehicles themselves and how they move and interact with the road they&#x27;re peeling across. The subtle weight shifts are noticeable if you watch the body of the cars closely as they turn, speed up, or hit the breaks. We also get a great look at the reflections on the windshields and side windows, and light reflections and flares off of shinier materials on the vehicles. Other details to look out for are the crowd density in the stands and the overcast skies. 
Sony&#x27;s newest entry in its impeccably detailed driving simulator hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 4.
How&#x27;s Gran Turismo 7 looking to you? How do you think it stacks up to other recent racers we&#x27;ve seen in the past couple of years? Let us know in the comments!</span>

“This is the run where I make real progress,” I tell myself. “Last time I got careless, but this time will be different.” With that self-assurance, I descend into the caves of Spelunky 2 for the umpteenth time.

                    <span>The 25th annual DICE Awards takes place next month and will honor the best and brightest titles to release in 2021. Unlike The Game Awards, which is a bit more mainstream and consists of votes from both media and the general public, the DICE Awards (which stands for Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) is helmed by The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. It&#x27;s also an industry-only event generally viewed as the most prestigious award ceremony in the business. Today, we found out this year’s event honors 59 nominated titles across 23 categories. 
Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart leads the pack in terms of the number of nominations with nine. Deathloop doesn’t lag far behind, garnering eight nominations. Academy members, which consists of a jury of industry peers, begin voting today. IGN …</span>

Chorus is a madcap barrage of laser beams, missiles, and impossible space combat dodges, boosts, and chases in its best moments. At its worst, it’s bogged down with tiresome and repetitive encounters, frustrating checkpoints, and bland characters. Sci-fi space combat shooters are a niche genre today, so while I’m thankful Chorus exists, much of the game is a relatively linear and mundane slog, punctuated by a few epic encounters here and there that live up to a galactic fantasy.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is just a few weeks away, and Techland is wrapping up its Dying 2 Know video series with Episode 6 today.
Like all previous episodes of Dying 2 Know, there&#x27;s a thing or two worth watching for. This time, Techland answers a frequently asked question with a little show and tell. Yes, there certainly is co-op play in the open world sequel, and it supports up to four players running around The City. Check out the video above to see footage of multiplayer in action.
Another big focus of Episode 6 is showing footage from the various platforms Dying Light 2 will be available on. Back in December, our own Senior Editor Brian Shea experienced this first hand, playing a portion of the game on PlayStation 4 Pro. Check out his hands-on impressions right here, where he was generally impressed with how it ran on older hardware.
Also in this episode, you&#x27;ll hear from the developers about working on the game over the last few years and, as always, there&#x27;s plenty of gameplay footage to check out.
Dying Light 2 Stay Human will be available on February 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch (Cloud), and PC. Apparently, the game is stuffed to the gills with 500 hours of gameplay, though that number has changed a few times this week. Regardless, check out our comparison to other games with long run times.</span>

                    <span>Microsoft has revealed that it is no longer producing new Xbox One consoles. 
That includes the original Xbox One console, Xbox One S (and its All-Digital edition), and Xbox One X. This isn’t anything new for the tech giant, though – it actually stopped manufacturing the Xbox One X and Xbox One S All-Digital edition in July of 2020. However, the Xbox One generation is officially done now that The Verge has learned that Microsoft stopped making Xbox One S consoles, the last of that generation still being manufactured, at the end of 2020. 
“To focus on the production of the Xbox Series X/S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,” senior director of Xbox console product marketing, Cindy Walker, told The Verge. 
This news comes just a day after a new Bloomberg write-up revealed that Sony is reportedly doing the exact opposite with its PlayStation 4 console, ramping up production of another 1 million units in 2022 to address the ongoing PlayStation 5 shortage. 
Of course, Microsoft’s news today doesn’t mean finding an Xbox One or one of its many variants will be impossible as there are still plenty out there on shelves. However, with news that these consoles are no longer being produced, we wouldn’t surprised if they started flying off the shelves as that’s what typically happens when the collector market hears of production on something ending. For example, try finding a Nintendo 3DS available to purchase at MSRP today – good luck. 
It’s not surprising that Microsoft is honing in its focus on its new-gen of consoles – the Xbox Series X and Series S – especially in light of industry reports that reveal the ongoing chip shortage that makes buying new-gen consoles so difficult at the moment could last until 2023.

                    <span>God of War was one of the best games released in 2018, and it will probably be one of the best games to release in 2022 because it’s now coming to PC. To find out what made that game great in the first place, be sure to read our original review. To learn what the developers think of playing the game with the mouse and keyboard or why they might not offer mod support, we spoke to Sony Santa Monica’s creative director Cory Barlog and senior manager of technical production Matt DeWald.
Let’s cut to the chase. Why do you think people should check God of War out now that it’s on PC? 
Matt DeWald: We’ve sold almost 20 million, like 19.5 million copies on console, but it’s surprising to hear that there are still people out there that have never played it. And if they haven’t played it on console …</span>

The studio also revealed that Hitman VR support, which works for all three Hitman games, will come to PC. 
Year 2 of Hitman 3 starts this month with the Elusive Target Arcade, which goes live on January 20. This is a new game mode that takes the Elusive Target concept featured in this trilogy to “the next level” as it “mixes up the formula and introduces new challenges and unlockable rewards, all whilst keeping the essence of what makes Elusive Targets exciting and interesting to play.”

                    <span>Shadow Man Remastered is a, well, remastered re-release of the 1999 cult game that launched on PC last April. The updated version comes from Nightdive Studios, the team currently handling the upcoming System Shock remake, and it&#x27;s making its surprise jump to consoles...today!
Shadow Man was developed by Acclaim and launched on August 31, 1999, for PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC before coming to the Sega Dreamcast later that same year. Players control the titular Shadowman, a superhero by Valiant Comics whose series first began in the early ‘90s. In addition to possessing enhanced strength, agility, and durability, Shadowman sports occult powers born from voodoo, which you&#x27;ll use to battle otherworldly foes to prevent an apocalypse. The game was a modest critical success and went to garner a cult following. You can watch the remaster’s launch trailer below.

The remaster features 4K visuals and 60 frames-per-second gameplay, with other graphical flourishes such as anti-aliasing and dynamic shadow mapping. Controls have also been modernized with mechanics such as a weapon wheel and auto-targeting. The Switch version, which launches January 17, includes gyro-aiming. For existing fans, the remaster also includes three new levels that were cut from the original release. 
You can pick up Shadow Man Remastered digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One now for $19.99.</span>

It offers the best look yet at this new take on the Pokémon formula, which is especially exciting because as of late, Nintendo has been churning out trailer after trailer showcasing essentially the same content. Not to mention, no official public hands-on previews have happened for this game so we don’t even know what playing Arceus feels like. However, today’s gameplay preview video provides some answers to a lot of the questions we had.

Today, Xbox has revealed what subscribers will be getting this month and, keeping in line with last month’s bonus, you can expect another bright green coating. This time, though, it’s for the warthog.

As noted in the tweet, this month’s bonus comes with challenge swaps which allow you to get rid of a challenge you don’t like and replace it with a new random one as well as double XP boosts, which are 60-minute boosts that earn you double XP for everything you do. 
The announcement tweet does not mention a date for when this month’s bonus will go live.

                    <span>Bandai Namco has revealed My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, a free-to-play battle royale coming to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. 
This new battle royale set in the universe of the popular manga-turned-anime My Hero Academia was announced in the latest issue of Weekly Jump, a Japanese magazine, as reported by Gematsu. All that we can glean of the game so far is what’s shown in Weekly Jump, which Gematsu has two screenshots of, so be sure to check out that report for some more details in Japanese and multiple in-game screenshots. 
“Team up to win a 24-player rumble in multiplayer action,” the magazine reads. 
According to the reveal, Bandai Namco has plans for a closed beta test for My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, which is not unusual for battle royales or free-to-play games for that matter. As for who to expect in the game, we see All-Might, Shoto Todoroki, Katsuki Bakugo, and of course, Izuku Midoriya. 
As for where this game falls narratively, that’s anybody’s guess although eagle-eyed fans might spot some giveaways that place it after certain events in the show. We won’t spoil any events here because you should either watch or read the very good My Hero Academia. 
Interestingly, Gematsu credits someone on Twitter as finding this magazine announcement but if you look for that tweet, it’s been deleted. Perhaps this Weekly Jump magazine wasn’t out yet and that person got an early copy of it or something; only time will tell. For now, My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble does not have a release date, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled for one. 
For more about this franchise, read about how Legendary Entertainment is giving My Hero Academia the live-action adaptation treatment. Check out our thoughts on My Hero One’s Justice after that.

                    <span>After launching on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, Astroneer, complete with the Xenobiology update, arrives today on Switch. The game has won its share of fans over the years since its launch, and the new content promises to send players on a planet-hopping, story-driven quest to uncover the secrets behind strange extraterrestrial lifeforms. As such, veteran players and would-be fans may be looking at this latest console release as a jumping-in point. Unfortunately, players may find the interstellar game doesn’t fly smoothly on Switch.
System Era Softworks is the development team behind this sci-fi adventure, and it counts amongst its crew experienced industry creators from places like 343 Industries, Valve, and EA. Astroneer allows players to hop into the spacesuit of an intergalactic …</span>

The post also acknowledges Riot Games&#x27; recent history, including their settlement last month of a gender discrimination lawsuit stretching back to 2018.

When future generations wish to understand what England was like in the early 21st century, they&#x27;ll simply need to play a Duke Nukem 3D level. Since June 2021, Dan Douglas has been making a DN3D level which captures facets of the real England: town centres, Wetherspoons, Greggs, a sausage roll nativity, Michael Gove dancing, lads, absolute madmen, life under Covid, performative patriotism, the Brexit bus, and so much more. It&#x27;s astonishing.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been over a decade since a core game in The Settlers series last made landfall on PC, and during that time the real-time management landscape has arguably changed quite a bit. There have been some great building games that have risen up, and even developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft Dusseldorf)&#x27;s own Anno series has staked a powerful claim to the city-building throne. But this incarnation of The Settlers isn&#x27;t so much about connecting to the series&#x27; past as it is about laying down foundations for the future. It&#x27;s had a slightly rocky road to launch, suffering several delays and refunded pre-orders after being postponed indefinitely back in 2020, but at long last this reboot of the classic city-building conquest-me-do is finally ready to beat down our door and come barrelling in. It&#x27;s launching in full on March 17th, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early version of the upcoming closed beta build that will be running from January 20th-24th. So settle in, folks. Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s shaping up.

                    <span>Happy 2022! New year, same old us. The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast will make no effort to change or better ourselves; this is our promise to you, listener. For our first episode of the new year we&#x27;re doing the traditional &quot;what games are we most looking forwards to&quot; episode. Yes, our most anticipated games. There is very little crossover, and lots of orc chat.
Before that, though, we&#x27;re lucky enough to have scored an interview with the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko&quot; guy. Yes, we have the man who came up with this winter&#x27;s most fashionable Marvel-based viral tweet, live and on the podcast (I mean, technically he is on the podcast every week but this week we ask him about the Blorko thing for like 20 minutes).

                    <span>I wouldn’t call it a new year’s resolution – mine for 2022 are learning piano and using fewer dashes – but generally I want to try new things with my PC. And one such opportunity recently presented itself via the new Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight yoke controller: I was going to learn how to fly.


In Microsoft Flight Simulator, obviously, but this honking great console of handles, buttons, joysticks and levers definitely looked like the right tool for the job. A simple flight stick this is not: there’s a full 180-degree yoke handle, an integrated display that can data like flight times, and a modular (but included as standard) throttle quadrant. The kind of thing you might own if your PC resembles a bisected turbine.

                    <span>On a stretch of futuristic tarmac, something clicked. Yellow quest markers hadn&#x27;t built my relationships in Cyberpunk 2077. When a job needed doing, then they&#x27;d steer me in the right direction. But for those initial sparks of story, my cellphone had been key. Chats and texts buzzed into my brain at all hours. &quot;Hey V&quot;, &quot;V, got a minute?&quot;, &quot;V!&quot;
Characters would get in contact with me, not the other way around. And I liked that. In fact, I&#x27;d say it helped build a living, breathing world more than Night City&#x27;s towering skyscrapers and moving billboards. More than, perhaps, any other big RPG I&#x27;ve played over the last couple of years.

They&#x27;ve just held a stream revealing plans for the second year of support and content, giving a look at the new Elusive Target Arcade mode (this time, the murders are permanent, not ephemeral) and announcing Freelancer mode. That will give Ian Hitman a safe house again, and send him out to take down organisations through chains of missions with randomised elements. Plus, the whole trilogy is coming to Game Pass. Lots of news.

Armor Games, a browser gaming titan of yore and more recently a conventional PC publisher too, have announced they&#x27;re switching permanently to a four-day working week of 32 hours. They join a small but growing group of companies in switching, most notably Eidos Montreal who announced last year that they were going to four-day workweeks. Alright, who&#x27;s next?

After entering early access in June 2020, they&#x27;re getting ready to wrap up the story campaign with its final act. Who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll actually make enough money from salvaging spaceships to escape our crippling debt?

                    <span>It&#x27;s probably more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to sidestep around comparisons to Mount &amp; Blade with Sands Of Salzaar. It&#x27;s mostly the structure. Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You&#x27;ll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you&#x27;ll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.
It&#x27;s no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.

                    <span>The studio co-founded by former Valve writer Chet Faliszek and former Riot designer Kimberly Voll have released The Anacrusis into early access today, a Left 4 Dead-like set in 70s space. Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.
Yes, it&#x27;s still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.

                    <span>Forever Skies is a newly announced first-person survival game by developer Far From Home. Players control a scientist who returns to a devastated, barely inhabitable Earth to scavenge for remains while making larger discoveries about how the planet has changed.
Earth is covered in a thick layer of toxic dust following an ecological disaster. You don’t know how Earth fell apart in the first place, though, so you’ll brave the environment to uncover artifacts and resources hinting at its demise. Finding ways to grow food and craft tools is also vital. The world’s ecosystem has changed dramatically though, so who knows what dangers you&#x27;ll find hidden beneath the clouds. 
An airbase serves as your floating headquarters. It can be customized to your liking, and you’ll use it as a laboratory, home, and workshop. You also appear to have a variety of tools at your disposal. The trailer shows off a wrist-mounted laser that vaporizes objects, such as a door to access a new area. Forever Skies will begin life as a single-player game, but Far From Home plans to add a co-op mode during its Early Access lifecycle.

Far From Home plans to launch Forever Skies in Early Access sometime this year. Though it will be available first on PC, the team plans to release the game on consoles, of which PlayStation 5 is confirmed, at a later date.

                    <span>A trailer for Amazon Prime Video’s upcoming Critical Role series, The Legend of Vox Machina, has been released alongside new details about the upcoming animated show. 
Amazon released a new Vox Machina trailer today and you can view the standard version below. However, if you’re looking for something more at home with the ramblings of the Critical Role cast that happen on Thursday nights, you might want to check out the red band version of this trailer, which features more gore and no beeps over Vox Machina’s more choice words.

It was revealed today by Variety that The Legend of Vox Machina will be released as a trio of episodes every week, for four weeks, starting on Friday, January 28. In a little over two weeks, the first three episodes will hit Amazon’s Prime Video subscription streaming service, and then the following Friday, another three episodes will be released and so on until the 12-episode Season 1 comes to an end. Don’t sweat, though – a second season has already been greenlit following massive Kickstarter success for this series. That same Kickstarter success also extended the first season from 10 episodes to 12. 
For the uninitiated, The Legend of Vox Machina is an animated series based on the first Critical Role D&amp;D campaign that ran from 2015 to 2017. Like the D&amp;D story it’s based on, the animated series sees Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Liam O’Brien, Marisha Ray, Matthew Mercer, Sam Riegel, Taliesin Jaffe, and Travis Willingham return to their roles. These eight Critical Role voice actors are also executive producing the series alongside Brandon Auman (Star Wars: Resistance) and Chris Prynoski (Metalocaypse). 
For more about Critical Role, check out these two statues released last year and then watch The Legend of Vox Machina red band trailer after that.

Monster Hunter: World was an important paradigm shift for Capcom’s beloved franchise. The well-paced difficulty ramp made progression enjoyable for newcomers, while countless endgame challenges kept expert hunters coming back for more. Monster Hunter Rise’s gameplay often attempts to copy World’s success, which isn’t always a bad thing. Battles continue to be an exhilarating dance with death, gear customization is satisfying, and coordinating hunts with friends makes for awesome fun and unexpected outcomes. Even with the int…</span>

January 12, 2022
The Kirby Twitter account posted about the milestone this morning. The tweet reads, &quot;2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series! Please look forward to a variety of #Kirby30 activities coming soon.&quot; A prior tweet actually announced the anniversary in Japanese and shared a link to a &quot;teaser site&quot; with commemorative wallpapers to celebrate the occasion. A rough translation of the tweet states there may be other &quot;goods and campaigns&quot; coming down the line. For now, the adorable wallpapers are a great way to start Kirby&#x27;s year.
Kirby&#x27;s Dreamland was released in 1992 for the Game Boy, soon after becoming one of the must-have games for the handheld system, at least for me. Its easygoing platforming and whimsical stages and characters set the stage for Kirby&#x27;s subsequent adventures on the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and so on. Here&#x27;s a fun fact about the first game: its Japanese title, Hoshi no Kirby, translates to &quot;Kirby of the Stars,&quot; which explains the absorbent hero&#x27;s penchant for riding and coughing up stars.
What do you want to see from the Kirby 30th anniversary? Are there any lost or forgotten Kirby adventures you&#x27;d like to see collected for Switch or elsewhere? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>PlayStation has released the top 20 PlayStation 5 downloads and PlayStation 4 downloads of 2021, and as you might expect, sports games took home the platinum trophy. 
On the PS5, NBA 2K22 was the number one most-downloaded PS5 game in the U.S. and Canada in 2021 while in Europe, unsurprisingly, FIFA 22 took the top spot. Call of Duty: Vanguard was the number two game in both regions, which, while not necessarily surprising because Call of Duty games always sell well, it’s pretty wild that a game released in November was the number two most-downloaded game of the entire year. 
Along those same lines, Among Us was the number six most-downloaded game of 2021 in the EU, despite releasing in December.
Here’s a full look at the top 10 PS5 games in the U.S. and Canada region:

                    <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl has been delayed to December 8. This news comes from developer GSC Game World on Twitter, who states they need more time to fulfill its vision of the game. The long-awaited sequel was previously scheduled to launch on April 28.
GSC’s message reads as follows:
Fans have been waiting for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 since it was first revealed in 2010. The game has had a tumultuous development history, including being canceled and restarted, not to mention some developer/investor drama. The first-person shooter sees players exploring the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to battle mutants, engage with factions, and more in a non-linear narrative. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 found itself embroiled in controversy last month when GSC announced plans to put real players in the game as NPCs…but as paid NFTs. Fans quickly revolted, which saw GSC first respond by standing its ground and defending the concept before reversing course and canceling all NFT plans just minutes later. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is slated to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

They disappear in seconds any time they go live online and finding one on store shelves feels as rare as winning the lottery. A new report from Bloomberg says that in order to deal with this shortage, Sony is producing more PlayStation 4 consoles. 
The publication reports that as Sony anticipates 2022 to be another year where the supply of PS5s struggles to keep up with the demand for the new-gen console, it’s ramping up production of the PS4. Despite what some might have thought, Sony said it did not have plans to end production on the PS4, although rumors said 2021 would be its last year.

                    <span>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have been out for a couple of months and while many players have likely already conquered the Elite Four and captured their mascot legendary, there’s still plenty to do in the Sinnoh region remakes. 
For example, today only, you can visit Snowpoint City to witness a fun and classic easter egg. Back in the original Gen IV games, if you visited Snowpoint City on January 12, you’d see “diamond dust” fall all over the town. While the game doesn’t necessarily point it out, it’s an easter egg that nods to Pokémon director and composer, Junichi Masuda, as noted by Eurogamer. You can see the diamond dust in Serebii’s Joe Merrick’s video on Twitter below:

Kirby and the Forgotten Land was revealed as a spring 2022 game, which could’ve placed its launch during any of the year’s earlier months, but today’s trailer reveals that it will be released on March 25. That’s just around the corner and it seems Nintendo is ready to reveal even more details about the game, with a gameplay trailer that showcases Kirby’s copy abilities and news that co-op will be a feature in the colorful (seemingly) post-apocalyptic title.

                    <span>Nine months after its debut on Nintendo Switch, Monster Hunter Rise today launched on PC. Capcom&#x27;s latest lizard-skinning simulator is a good&#x27;un, and what we played of it pre-release seemed like a solid PC port. However, now the game is out in the world, some would-be players are being blocked out by a bug which doesn&#x27;t let them even start a new save. Still, the majority of folks seem to be quite happily hollowing out dogs to make slippers.

                    <span>Watching the trailer for upcoming craft-o-survival game Forever Skies, I now understand how people who fear the ocean must feel about Subnautica. While I&#x27;m at my happiest in water, I know depths and strange sealife give many others the heebie-jeebies. However, heights make me pray for death. So a game about exploring the skies and skyscrapers above the ruins of human civilisation in a customisable airship, ah yes, I would like to die now, thank you very much.

                    <span>Valorant Episode 4 has kicked off, bringing with it new agent Neon who - like that famous blue hedgehog - goes fast. They&#x27;re able to sprint and slide around maps at blistering speeds, which might seem at odds with the game&#x27;s tactical pace, but they fit into the roster nicely. Thing is, you&#x27;ve got to be brave enough to get the most out of their move set, which rewards ballsy plays over careful corner turns. It&#x27;s safe to say I struggled to break out of my tentative shell, but when I did? Hoo boy, what a thrill.

                    <span>Given that we&#x27;ve still only seen scraps of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 after years of development and with launch supposedly mere months away, I suppose it&#x27;s not a surprise to hear the game is delayed. The developers, GSC Game World today announced that they&#x27;ve pushed the launch back by seven months, giving the first-person explore-o-shooter a new release date of the 8th of December. It&#x27;s the usual perfectly sensible reason: they want it to be good, and they think it needs more time to be good.

                    <span>Fatherly axe-‘em-up God of War is out on PC this week, and I’ve been dragging my disappointing son around the Nine Realms to see how it copes with the jump from PlayStation to Windows. The answer: pretty well! Like previous marquee Sony port Horizon Zero Dawn, this is a game that already looked lovely on console, and the extra muscle of even a modest PC rig can deliver sizeable boosts to both visual quality and frames-per-second.

                    <span>In the eight year gap between 2010&#x27;s more conventional sexy gore fest God Of War 3 and this new and improved action-dadventure God Of War, the angry Ancient Greek warboy Kratos handed in his god-killing badge and gun to live in Norse mythology&#x27;s woods with his wife Faye and their son Atreus. When Faye dies, Kratos &amp; Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that&#x27;ll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.
I played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it&#x27;s actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.

                    <span>Much has been made of how long games take to complete this week. After Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take 500 hours to fully complete the game over the weekend, the internet&#x27;s collective groan over the revelation was reportedly heard from the far reaches of space. Personally, I think it&#x27;s a preposterous figure for a single-player game, but as someone who also maintains an active spreadsheet of all my various playtime stats (yes, really), it also got me thinking. Is 500 hours really so nonsensical in the grand scheme of things? I asked the team what their most played game on Steam is to find out. 
And as it turns out, Dying Light 2&#x27;s 500 hour completion time ain&#x27;t got nothing on some of our favourite time hogs...

Soon, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone will play host to a cursed set of Attack On Titan cosmetics, including gun bits and an Operator skin. They are frightening and confusing. Please avert your eyes.

                    <span>Wordle has engrossed me for a couple of weeks, along with much of the rest of the internet. It&#x27;s also a free, simple word game, meaning it&#x27;s relatively easy to recreate. Naturally, other developers are building their own twists on its core.

Among them, Absurdle is my favourite, an &quot;adversarial version&quot; of the game where the winning word changes as you guess. I&#x27;m also fond of Sweardle, however, a version designed for four-letter words.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>The last few years have seen Bidoof emerge as one of the more popular Pokémon in the fandom. Not so much because The Pokémon Company has rolled out the red carpet of marketing for it as often as it does for Pikachu and Eevee. Nay, it has largely been fans that have willed Bidoof to the stratosphere thanks to a plethora of cute memes and tributes. The Pokémon Company is leaning into this movement, releasing a charming animated short called Bidoof’s Big Stand.
The eight-minute story stars a cowardly and accident-prone Bidoof who just can’t seem to do anything right, much to the chagrin of its fellow Bidoof and other wild Pokémon. It’s not until a chance meeting with a human trainer that it realizes its true potential. If you proudly identify as a Bidoof stan or simply need a cheerful pick-me-up, Bidoof&#x27;s Big Stand offers a cute and humourous tip of the cap to the beaver-like critter.

If the animation has you pining to capture a Bidoof of your own, you&#x27;re in luck! You can find plenty of them roaming the Sinnoh region in the recently released Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. With any luck, we’ll also bump into a Hisiuan version in the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</span>

                    <span>Ubisoft has announced Ezio Auditore&#x27;s adventures will finally grace the Switch next month. Assassin&#x27;s Creed: The Ezio Collection will be available for Nintendo&#x27;s portable hybrid console on February 17.
The collection, which was originally released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016, features the Italian Renaissance trilogy starring the aforementioned Ezio Auditore. Included in the package are Assassin&#x27;s Creed II, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Brotherhood, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Revelations, all with enhanced visuals and now Switch-specific features. Other than the apparent new portability of these games, developer Virtuous has added support for HD Rumble, a touch screen interface, and an optimized HUD.

Check out the trailer above to see how the second generation of Assassin&#x27;s Creed translates to the Switch. If it&#x27;s looking like an offer you can&#x27;t refuse, it&#x27;ll only set you back $39.99. Otherwise, grab The Ezio Collection on PlayStation or Xbox if you can&#x27;t wait a few weeks.

Spencer had previously told his staff in an open letter that leadership was “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments.” He clarified what that means as well as the publisher’s larger philosophy on maintaining relationships with partners embroiled in workplace controversy.

She’s proven herself, becoming a hero in the eyes of the populace around her. Of course, once you succeed and earn the title of “greatest machine hunter in the land,” the pressure’s on to live up to people’s expectations, and Aloy isn’t going to have it easy this time around.
When it rains, it pours. Six months after the events of Horizon Zero Dawn, Aloy heads westward to find out more about a mysterious Red Blight, which signals the degradation of the biosphere. If the stakes weren’t already high enough, her journey to new soil also brings new threats. This time peril comes not just in the form of harrowing machines, b…</span>

Lego has delayed the upcoming release of its Lego Overwatch 2 Titan set as a result of the ongoing Activision Blizzard controversy. 
This news comes by way of TheBrickFan, which reports that Lego is pausing the release of the set in order to review its partnership with Activision Blizzard in light of allegations against the company and leadership within. The latest of said controversy was revealed back in December when a current Blizzard employee said in a press conference that she was demoted after filing an HR complaint about sexual harassment. Here’s Lego’s official statement regarding the indefinite delay:
This decision by Lego must have come in the final hour because the Overwatch 2 Titan set was due out very soon. With less than three weeks to go, it wouldn’t be surprising if these boxes were already being sent to retailers before today. 
There’s no word on when this set will be released or when Lego’s review of its partnership with Activision Blizzard will be complete.

                    <span>Bungie revealed way back in 2020 that Savathûn, the sister of Oryx from Destiny’s The Taken King, would be getting her own expansion and last year, the studio revealed that our guardians would be taking on The Witch Queen come February. 
With February 22 right around the corner, Bungie’s marketing for the upcoming Destiny 2 expansion has been ramping up and today, the company released a trailer all about the new exploration area in it: Savathûn’s Throne World. As seen in other trailers, Savathûn is a big fan of anything with a dark hue of green and her throne world is no different. However, all is not as it seems there as Savathûn considers the area to essentially be an extension of her mind.

“Tell me, oh honored guest,” Savathûn says in the trailer. “Why would you want to escape? This Throne World is indistinguishable from my own mind, Guardian. Every step taken, every bullet fired, I keep and count them all. It’s not too late to turn around.” 
That’s not foreboding at all…
As you can see in the trailer above, the Throne World looks quite unique compared to other places we’ve visited in Destiny 2, with a distinct horror feel to it all. It also looks quite diverse, too, which is exciting. The trailer’s description mentions Savathûn’s “glistening palace” and “gnarled roots in the swamp” so it sounds like there’s a journey ahead of us before actually reaching Savathûn’s Throne. 
We’ll all learn more when The Witch Queen hits Destiny 2 on February 22. 
While waiting for this expansion, check out Game Informer’s Lore Refresher on Savathûn and then read about how you’ll need need the digital deluxe edition of The Witch Queen to play through its dungeons, less you want to purchase them separately. Watch this narrative-focused trailer for Destiny 2: The Witch Queen released back in December after that.

                    <span>Far: Changing Tides, the sequel to 2018’s Far: Lone Sails, has secured a release date, and it’s not too far (eh?) away. The meditative post-apocalyptic adventure sets sail on March 1. 
Like its predecessor, Changing Tides tasks players with piloting and maintaining a large makeshift vessel, this time to explore a flooded world. Along the way, you’ll explore underwater cities and other vestiges of humanity while solving environmental puzzles in the ship or on foot. The adolescent protagonist can dive beneath the surface to recover scrap and other materials as well. Like in the first game, don’t be surprised if you grow attached to your ship as you constantly tinker with it in order to overcome new obstacles. A new release date trailer offers a fresh, albeit brief, look at what’s in store.

Ross spoke rather freely with FTW about his philosophies of creating games, stories from the creation of Days Gone, and what he felt went right and wrong with the project. He also spoke about iteration in games, which he was hoping to do in a potential sequel to the open-world zombie/biker adventure. Comparing Days Gone to other popular franchises, Ross points out how the Batman: Arkham series or Uncharted build upon the ideas and features as the installments go on. &quot;So you create the minimum viable entry and then hope you get to build the second one,&quot; Ross says, &quot;Because you’re…</span>

This studio was formally created on December 1, 2021, as a “second development base in Japan,” as first reported by Gematsu. Sapporo was established to focus on new software development and debugging. It will be led by former Phantasy Star Online 2 chief producer Takaya Segawa, who was promoted to a senior corporate position for Sega in April of last year.

Not at all unlike the stormy weather featured in EA Dice’s latest release, Battlefield 2042, players can use these new tornadoes to traverse the battle royale map quickly by simply hopping in. You’ll know a tornado is on the way, too, as it’ll swirl in the sky first before touching down.

“If you see a tornado start to form, that’s no signal to flee,” a press release about the v19.01 update reads. “Instead, run into it as a swirling escape strategy. You’ll spin round and round ‘til you choose to glide to safety – or if you stay spinning long enough – ‘til the twister spit…</span>

                    <span>If you’ve been playing Halo Infinite, you’re likely aware that the game’s popular 12v12 mode, Big Team Battle, can be quite broken under certain circumstances. 
If you’re playing solo or with one other friend, launching into a match is much easier than launching into one with a larger squad. If you fall into the latter camp, there’s a good chance you can’t even get into a match proper and while 343 Industries attempted to get this issue mitigated before the studio’s holiday break, it wasn’t able to get it completely fixed. According to a new post-holiday break Halo Infinite blog post, a fix is coming soon.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s Big Team Battle mode has been unplayable for many almost since the shooter&#x27;s release. 343 Industries tried to address the issue last month without success, and then holidays hit and delayed things further. In an update posted yesterday, 343 say they now have a fix in testing and hope to release it as soon as they can.

                    <span>After trundling across the desert with a wee sandskiff in the delightful Far: Lone Sails, developers Okomotive will soon invite us to sail above and below a strange ocean in the sequel. They announced today that Far: Changing Tides will launch on the 1st of March and oh goodness me, it&#x27;s another anticipated indie that will be available through Game Pass from the start. (Anticipated by us, anyway—it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated games of 2022.)

Lots of studying and cataloguing plants, serving customers, and feeling proud of your wee business. Plus solving mysteries in ways only an occult plant shop owner can. Not long to wait now, as the makers announced today that the game will launch on the 21st of January.

                    <span>Over the weekend, Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take &quot;500 hours to complete the game&quot;. This turned out not to be the exciting selling point they expected for the open-world zombie-mashing parkour-o-shooter. Many found this claim exhausting because oh my god 500 hours is over 20 days, what do you think we do with our lives, and how much of that is busywork? After initially backtracking to clarify that 500 hours is how long it&#x27;d take to do absolutely everything, Techland have now explained that you can finish the game&#x27;s main story in 20 hours, or 80 if you hit every side quest too.

                    <span>The director of Moon and Warcraft is still dreaming of making a movie version of Full Throttle, the classic LucasArts adventure game about rough &#x27;n&#x27; tough bikers and lovers. A year ago Duncan Jones released a tentative script he banged out in a fit of procrastination, and in 2022 he&#x27;s still thinking of the smell of asphalt. In a cheeky wee tweet over the weekend, he asked fans to bug LucasOwners Disney to let him do it.

                    <span>Giant sprawling MMORPGs are a rarity these days compared to when it seemed like new options were available for players every week. Lost Ark has already had success in other regions, but the title will finally see a launch in North America next month after many years. In a nutshell, Lost Ark has a ton of features and mechanics that you’d expect in a traditional MMORPG like dungeons, raids, loot, crafting, home building, and more. So what’s the hook? It’s all tied together with stylish action combat, more akin to what you’d find in a modern ARPG like Diablo, Path of Exile, or Torchlight. Check out the trailer below to get a taste of what you can expect!

With various character classes to suit most traditional archetypes and years and years of content already online in other territories, Lost Ark has a blueprint for launching heavy and hard come February 11 on PC. We’ll have to see exactly what choices Amazon Games has made to many systems, especially monetization, but we won’t have long to wait. Are you looking forward to Lost Ark?

                    <span>Over the weekend, developer Techland made waves on social media by tweeting that its upcoming open-world zombie sequel, Dying Light 2: Stay Human, would take &quot;at least 500 hours&quot; to fully complete. While the studio likely thought this was good messaging to showcase just how much content is in its branching-narrative story, the announcement was met with some backlash amidst the excitement, as some players bemoaned the length and worried about bloat or that they would never see the end of such a massive adventure.
Later, as the studio saw some of the negative response, the Dying Light Twitter account clarified to one fan that you can complete the story and side-quests in 70 to 80 hours, &quot;if you&#x27;re not in a rush.&quot; Then, the official Twitter account took the messaging wide, saying that &quot;500 ho…</span>

                    <span>I’m old enough to remember when the first Yakuza game released on the PlayStation 2 in 2006 (2005 in Japan). That initial release was treated like a joke in the U.S. Yakuza was seen as a Japanese crime curio by some and an inferior Grand Theft Auto knock-off by others. But mostly, it was just ignored. 
Over the years, creator Toshihiro Nagoshi and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio continued to churn out one Yakuza sequel after the other. I remember a small minority in the gaming community praised the series’ combat, humor, and storytelling, but the general public broadly waved off these games. However, slowly something started to change. With each new Yakuza, that vocal minority grew until they just couldn’t be ignored. 
I decided to find out what everyone was going on about with the release of Yakuza …</span>

                    <span>Update, 2:50 p.m. EST, 1/10/21:
Following this past weekend’s reveal that doing every single thing in Dying Light 2 Stay Human will take 500 hours (and less than 100 hours to beat the story, complete all side quests, and explore the map), Techland has told Game Informer that the main story of Dying Light 2 can be completed in about 20 hours. 
“Completing all the side quests, learning about the world’s history, and engaging with all characters can easily take 80 hours or more, depending on playstyle,” Techland says. “Dying Light 2 takes place in a complex world filled with content and built both broadly and vertically.” 
For comparison, Techland says that in the original Dying Light, finishing the main story and all side quests took about 30 hours. 
“According to our internal QA testing, it…</span>

                    <span>These days, you can&#x27;t shake a stick without bouncing brown beams around the room. Raytracing has been a hot high-end graphics trend for a few years, with new games boasting support for the complex lighting simulators and old games being retrofitted with shine. This year, a new Half-Life mod will add raytracing support to Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter, and even as someone usually perfectly happy with old games looking old, I think it doesn&#x27;t look half-bad. See for yourself in the new video, below.

                    <span>As we’ve already seen from the demo, the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise spruces itself up considerably from the Nintendo Switch original. It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

                    <span>After the roaring success of Monster Hunter: World back in 2018, the idea that the next big PC entry in Capcom&#x27;s dino pants craft &#x27;em up is a game that originally started life on the Nintendo Switch is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom&#x27;s stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

                    <span>Zynga, the company whose games made being Facebook friends with your family even more annoying, are selling to Take-Two. The owners of Rockstar and 2K plan to buy up Zynga shares in a deal that&#x27;ll value the company at $12.7 billion (£9.4b). Take-Two hope to use Zynga&#x27;s social and mobile expertise to make more games based on their games. Sure sure, #business and all, but I&#x27;d rather spend that much money on 9.8 billion Greggs sausage rolls instead of Grand Theft Autoville or something.

                    <span>One of the presents I got for Christmas this year was a copy of PS5 exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I had about a week where I was completely by myself this year, and I spent it being Spidey and self-yeeting around New York. It&#x27;s a great game on many levels, and I especially liked that one of the outfits you can unlock through story missions is a scarf and ear warmers. Mostly though, it&#x27;s just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By &quot;more games&quot;, I mean &quot;every game&quot;.

                    <span>I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That&#x27;s okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn&#x27;t how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don&#x27;t think about it.

                    <span>Techland have achieved something incredible. With a single Dying Light 2 marketing Tweet, they caused the greatest mass exhalation seen, perhaps, ever. Thousands of adults were informed that to &quot;fully complete Dying 2: Stay Human, you&#x27;ll need at least 500 hours&quot; and collectively sighed at their desks, heads in hands. Even some hurried backtracking from Techland&#x27;s marketing team couldn&#x27;t save us from exhaustion.

                    <span>Nová verze 6.2 operačního systému DragonFlyBSD přináší tři klíčové novinky. Tou pro desktopy nejpodstatnější je zahrnutí ovladače AMDGPU, tedy konečně moderního ovladače pro Radeony mnoha posledních generací, který v DragonFlyBSD chyběl. Prozatím to má ještě jednu mušku, systém zde zakládá na verzi z Linuxu 4.19, tedy nezahrnuje nejnovější možný ovladač AMDGPU se všemi architektonickými optimalizacemi.

                    <span>V linuxovém jádře často nastane situace, že je potřeba uvolnit stránku paměti. V současnosti se o to stará algoritmus LRU (Least Recently Used). Google ale již nějako dobu pracuje na multigenerational LRU (MGLRU). Podle Google současný LRU spotřebuje mnoho CPU a často se rozhodne pro uvolnění nesprávné stránky. Nové MGLRU je přímočaré, výkonné a univerzální. Hodí se jak pro mobilní zařízení, tak pro výkonné servery.</span>

                    <span>V prosinci na Kickstarteru začala kampaň s UPS HAT pro Raspberry Pi. Podporovány jsou všechny modely, ale rozměrově HAT odpovídá velkým Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3 a 4. Použity jsou dvě Li-ion 18650 baterie (není součástí balení). Nabíjí se externím zdrojem 8,4 V 2 A. UPS umožňuje v reálném čase sledovat napětí a proudy přes I2C.</span>

I&#x27;ve had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various &quot;Happy Ending Mods&quot; to change the close of Commander Shepard&#x27;s story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

                    <span>Developers have good taste in games. That&#x27;s the take away from each year&#x27;s Independent Games Festival Awards, which consistently selects shortlists of excellent games. The nominations for 2022 are up, and the contenders for this year&#x27;s Seumas McNally Grand Prize includes Unpacking, Inscryption, Loop Hero, Cruelty Squad, The Eternal Cylinder and Unsighted. Sounds about right.

                    <span>Video game marketers are eternally trying to one up each other with stupid terms. From the industry which bought you &quot;levelution&quot;, the &quot;drivatar&quot;, and &quot;gameplay trailers&quot; which aren&#x27;t gameplay comes a new one: &quot;gameplay lore trailer&quot;. The year has barely begun but Ubisoft are gunning it out the gate with the new Rainbow Six Siege trailer. This new gameplay lore trailer—yeesh!—explains why a game set within Tom Clancy&#x27;s serious world of paranoid jingoistic masturbation is overrun with a weird parasite mutating people into monsters.

                    <span>The person who edited Austin Powers into Mass Effect, to the delightful and horror of all, has now spliced up another storm. Their latest video melds Mr Bean clips with scenes from Cyberpunk 2077 and goodness me, he seems thrilled to enter a dystopian megacity. You might fear Night City will eat the rubber-faced fool alive, but maybe he&#x27;s the only one of us who could survive it. Come watch!

                    <span>2021 was the year of the time loop wasn&#x27;t it? Deathloop topped a lot of charts and made an appearance in our game of the year list. Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the &quot;time skip&quot;, instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren&#x27;t without their flaws, but I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

                    <span>CES is a gloriously mad hodgepodge of different tech fields; the kind where smartphone chip makers share floor space with car manufacturers and sex toys. It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

                    <span>I was a little worried about Left 4 Dead-alike Rainbow Six: Extraction. You know, after it was announced as Rainbow Six: Quarantine, changed its name, dipped under the radar for ages, then re-emerged with news it was being delayed. Signs pointed to a shaky spin-off from Rainbow Six: Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode. But no, I was totally wrong! After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

                    <span>2022 is finally here and that can only mean one thing. We&#x27;ve got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we&#x27;ve been busy rustling up the ones we&#x27;re most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won&#x27;t find them here, but trust us, you&#x27;ll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we&#x27;ve listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We&#x27;ve got games big and small here, and they&#x27;re all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we&#x27;ve missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

                    <span>Last September, Studio Pixel Punk released Unsighted, a top-down action RPG with a unique time limit on the life of its NPCs. It quickly garnered high praise from critics, including RPS&#x27; own Katharine Castle who named it one of the Best Games You Missed in 2021. To find out more about this indie gem, I got in touch with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s pair of developers Fernanda Dias and Tiani Pixel to talk to them about its inspirations, turning off its timer, and the true meaning behind the game&#x27;s name.

                    <span>Developers Might And Delight call Book Of Travels a TMORPG, a &quot;tiny&quot; MMO that&#x27;s focused on fleeting interactions with other players, as opposed to lots of them. It’s a lovely looking adventure with a neat concept, so it was sad to hear that they&#x27;d been hit with layoffs after a difficult launch. However, some heartening news! More levels are on the way, as well as new character customisation tools. They also reaffirmed that despite being a much smaller team than before, they&#x27;re committed to working on the game for the foreseeable.

                    <span>Unsurprisingly, E3 will once again not happen as an in-person event this year, what with the whole global pandemic and all. The Entertainment Software Association, who organise E3, had hoped that the main event on the video games industry&#x27;s marketing calendar would return properly this year, after skipping 2019 and going online in 2020, but nope. While they haven&#x27;t yet confirmed whether or not they&#x27;ll arrange an online E3 in its stead, they seem to be considering it. But even if not, the industry will doubltess manage to host its own advert-o-ramas without the E3 banner.

So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It&#x27;s now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

                    <span>I have a strange relationship with Dead Cells. I picked it up in 2019 and played it for a while, by which point I&#x27;d clearly had my fill. No DLCs to my name, nothing. I&#x27;d done a big run and put the game down.
Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I&#x27;m nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can&#x27;t be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

                    <span>If you prefer Earth be but a blue marble alone in the void, two of the latest Game Pass additions might tickle your spacefancy. Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today adds BioWare&#x27;s remastered Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy as well as the beautiful clockwork mystery Outer Wilds, which was our favourite game of 2019. The cooperative and chaotic first-person firefighting game Embr hit Game Pass today too but that has, like, gravity? So passé.

It&#x27;s called The Queen And The Sea and is home to shipwrecks and lighthouses infested with monsters, mainly. And a throwable shark. That’s me sold.

In all likelihood, though, that’s not going to happen, so instead let’s put our chins in our palms, angle our heads slightly and gaze off into the sky while picturing all the neat PC hardware that’s launching this year.

                    <span>Konami, the Japanese company best known for squandering every shred of goodwill they built through series like Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, are getting into NFTs. Of course they are. Should&#x27;ve guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

Today they announced a release date of January 18th for Nobody Saves The World, a top-down ARPG with where players can transform into everything from a rogue to a rat, and customise them to be even weirder. It will be on Game Pass, too.

The monster-mashing spin-off from R6 Siege isn&#x27;t one of their full-price games, coming at a slightly cheaper £34, but still, damn, that&#x27;s a good get. And exactly the sort of game I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy new but would try on Game Pass.

                    <span>In a serious of coordinated raids, Turkish police have detained 40 people suspected of involvement with a money laundering ring which allegedly used Twitch for money laundering. Supposedly they were using stolen credit card info to buy Bits (Twitch&#x27;s virtuacurrency), which they would then donate to Twitch streamers who had agreed to give money in return in exchange for keeping a portion for themselves. This first came to light following Twitch&#x27;s big data leak last year.

It&#x27;ll also be one of the few games to support Intel&#x27;s new XeSS upscaling fanciness.

                    <span>Steam has existed in a grey area in China, technically not following rules which require all games be approved yet never drawing the ire of authorities. Many have long expected it to eventually be banned, though, especially after Valve partnered with Perfect World to launch the limited Steam China. This might now be happening. Maybe. Or it&#x27;s possibly being hindered, at least. This all started with a big stink on Christmas Day that led some to declare Steam had been banned by the Great Firewall which restricts access to many sites outside China, but the reality is not so clear cut.

                    <span>The vanguard of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs had some seriously good chips in it – including two of the best CPUs for gaming overall – though there weren’t many models for aspiring PC builders on tight budgets. Now, though, Intel has used CES 2022 to launch the rest of the 12th Gen desktop lineup, adding loads of more affordable Core i5 and Core i3 processors on top of new Core i7 and Core i9 options. Intel also unveiled its new H-series, 12th Gen gaming laptop chips, which use the same hybrid architecture (combining powerful P-cores with smaller, less energy-intensive E-cores) as their Alder Lake desktop cousins.

Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature.

                    <span>Nightingale certainly isn&#x27;t the sort of game I was expecting from a former BioWare developer, but I&#x27;m well excited to give it a go. Announced at The Game Awards 2021, Nightingale is a survival craft &#x27;em up set in a fantastical, alt-history world. It&#x27;s being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. 
But don&#x27;t go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare&#x27;s recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it&#x27;s being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.

                    <span>Happy New Year, folks! 2021 may be behind us now, but before we start looking ahead to all the hip new video games coming our way this year, we thought it was as good a time as any to look back at all of our favourites from the last twelve months. If you kept up to date with our hale and healthy Advent Calendar over the course of December, then you&#x27;ll already know our game of the year selections for 2021, but this post gathers all those lovely words and entries together into one handy list.

                    <span>Riot Games, the makers of Valorant and League Of Legends, have agreed to pay out $100 million (£74m) as part of a proposed settlement to a class-action suit brought against them for &quot;systemic sex discrimination and harassment&quot;. Money will go to current and former female employees and contract workers. The suit started in 2018 following widespread allegations of a festering workplace culture, and was originally due to be settled for $10 million (£7m) until California state authorities raised objections that it wasn&#x27;t enough.

                    <span>The first rule of video game club (apart from not talking about video game club) usually involves saving the world somehow. We do our best to rescue others from harm, to avert world-ending disasters, and give everyone around us the happy ending they deserve. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned about myself in 2021, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a cruel, heartless robot who will happily toss others under the bus if they don&#x27;t provide any material benefit to me. Or at least I am when I&#x27;m playing Unsighted, the gorgeous and criminally underrated action RPG from Studio Pixel Punk that puts a ticking time-bomb inside each of its characters&#x27; metallic chests which, if left unchecked, will remove them from the game entirely, preventing you from gaining some potentially very handy upgrades to help you in your quest to fight back against your human oppressors. 
It&#x27;s an ingenious system, as you&#x27;re not only fighting against the hordes of enemies that appear onscreen, but your own ineptitude.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re anything like me, when you start a game you will almost invariably try to run off into the woods or swamp and aggressively ignore anything even passably resembling a main story. After hours of feeling like a brave rebel by doing this in Vagrus - The Riven Realms, I realised it&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to play it. This is not a game about some Epic Quest or grand campaign. It&#x27;s a game about running a caravan in a world that just happens to have a cool history.

                    <span>2021 was hot boy summer for detectives. Well, not summer. Hot boy autumn? Is that a thing? Anyway, I not only played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, but also an incarnation of Hercule Poirot as a bright young thing in Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. And yes, that name is a bit of a nightmare, but the game itself is very sweet. There&#x27;s &#x27;orrible murder, conspiracy, blackmail, union busting, and a cast of Cluedo-esque characters trapped inside a snowy manor. And yes, I am reusing the shoddy Love Island promo photo composite I made for a header picture, because it deserves the mileage.

                    <span>Ghost Time Games’ Tux And Fanny, from co-developers Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig, is not only the game I think you may have missed this year, but it is also my Game Of The Year for 2021. This game sends two best friends (alongside a courageous flea and a mischievous cat) through adventures great, small, and absurd to stunning effect – and you owe it to yourself to give this little marvel a play before the year is well and truly out.

                    <span>It’s pretty difficult to quantify which games actually whip ass, mostly because it’s a little subjective. That being said, if barrelling through the streets of a futuristic, neon-glazed Detroit, hopping over pursuing cop cars and racing through business offices and factories to the tune of an engrossing soundtrack doesn’t whip ass, I don’t know what does.
