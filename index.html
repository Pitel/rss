This week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct went out with a bang, announcing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond would be releasing at some point in 2025. Alongside the title and release date reveal, we got our very first look at the new chapter, which was originally announced seven years ago.
If you&#x27;re hungry for even more footage, it seems there is actually a little bit extra featured on Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese teaser website for the game. The background of the page features another look at the jungle-like environment, which we got a brief look at in the official trailer.

Ahead of the launch of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD for the Nintendo Switch next week, Walmart in the US has reportedly been cancelling physical pre-orders.
As highlighted by GoNintendo, the &quot;exact same situation&quot; that played out with pre-orders for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door last month is now happening with Luigi&#x27;s new release. The retailer is once again offering a discount code of $25 on the next purchase over $45 as an apology but hasn&#x27;t explained why it&#x27;s cancelling orders.

Switch Online&#x27;s N64 library didn&#x27;t get off to the best start, with select games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time filled with a bunch of emulation issues. Nintendo rolled out updates for the app in response to this and since then the situation has somewhat improved.
Unfortunately, it seems one of the latest releases for the service is reportedly in a rough state at launch. The Switch Online emulation of Rare&#x27;s famous first-person shooter Perfect Dark supposedly has a whole range of &quot;problems&quot;, according to well-known GoldenEye 007 enthusiast &#x27;Graslu00&#x27;, who previously lifted the lid on the cancelled Xbox 360 title.

                              <span>People enjoy Warhammer 40K for a number of reasons. The stories and lore, the aesthetics of the models, or even just for the video games. Many players, however, are out to win tabletop battles. And for that, you&#x27;ll need a strong army.


Below is a list of 10 Warhammer 40K armies that have over a 50% win rate according to official statistics. So for one reason or another, they&#x27;re pretty good. It is thanks to Stat Check that we know these statistics, although the reasons behind each army&#x27;s success has been gathered from public opinion and my own knowledge.


Also remember that nothing good ever lasts in the grimdark future, so expect some nerfs to the top performers as time goes on. Additionally, I have not ranked these entries as the data will shift around, and subtle overtakes could occur …</span>

                              <span>The Expanse is easily one of the best space operas of all time, and there’s no shortage of ways to dive into the series.


The novels by James S.A. Corey kicked off The Expanse all the way back in 2011. Since then we’ve gotten six seasons of a TV adaptation, a number of comic books, a TTRPG ruleset, and a five-chapter Telltale Games series. All of that hasn’t been enough to satiate my desire for more of The Expanse, and I know I can’t be alone. Fortunately there are plenty of other video games that manage to capture the overall vibe of Corey’s series, and if you’re working your way through another re-read, there’s a game that almost perfectly pairs with each book in The Expanse.

                              <span>You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It&#x27;s a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it&#x27;s not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Sega announced Fearless: The Year of Shadow, a yearlong celebration of one of Sonic&#x27;s biggest rivals, adversaries, and frenemies, Shadow the Hedgehog. In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
&quot;Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise. They&#x27;re very popular and dynamic characters.&quot;

Despite the setback, the tool&#x27;s developers are not giving up.

                              <span>UK police are reporting yet another pirate IPTV-related arrest. A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

                              <span>The consensus on Destiny 2&#x27;s latest expansion pack is quite clear: The Final Shape is a delight in most ways that matter, and it delivers a superb finale to the Light and Dark saga. For those eager to grab all the available content through the Legacy Collection, though, there is bad news.


Specifically, even though it&#x27;s a good thing that Bungie has bundled all of Destiny 2&#x27;s previous expansion packs into a single Legacy Collection bundle (which makes the deal particularly enticing for newcomers), you don&#x27;t actually get all of the older legacy content at once. Instead, you&#x27;ll still be missing out on Dungeon Keys for the Lightfall and Witch Queen expansion packs. In effect, this means you only get access to the three classic dungeons (Pit of Heresy, Shattered Throne, and Grasp of Avarice) a…</span>

The new cinematic quest is great for those who&#x27;ve caught up with the story so far, the newest frame Jade makes for a great support frame, and all the new weapons make for easy Mastery, or possibly some new tools for your arsenal. 


One aspect that&#x27;s not talked about much however can be massive for your builds. Here are all the new mods introduced with Warframe&#x27;s Jade Shadows update.

                              <span>Warframe&#x27;s Jade Shadows update brings with it a ton of new stuff, including a surprisingly emotional new cinematic quest. It even brings a bunch of quality of life, such as showing which planets you&#x27;ve completed all nodes on at a glance. 


One of the newest additions is a new mission type, though how you access it can be a little confusing at first. Here&#x27;s how to access the Ascension mission type in Warframe.


How to get into the new Ascension mission in Warframe

To access the new Ascension mission, you first want to complete the main quest Jade Shadows. This quest requires you to have completed the New War quest, so you&#x27;ll need to progress the story until you&#x27;ve done that before you can consider the new mission type. Once you complete Jade Shadows, a new variant of the node Brutus, Uranus should appear, letting you play Ascension. This is a 40-50 level mission, so be sure to bring some good gear along with you.


The Ascension mission begins with a Mobile Defense portion where you must defend a Mote Collector, before moving to a constantly rising elevator. This elevator must be powered up using power cells located in each of the side rooms within the elevator shaft. Once you reach the top and deal with the spawning Sisters of Parvos, the mission will be complete. You&#x27;ll also receive Vestigial and Volatile Motes, which can be spent at Ordis in Larunda Relay.


As it stands, Digital Extremes has yet to confirm if the Ascension mode will come to other nodes (or receive its own node). It may be similar to Mirror Defense where it&#x27;s kept very limited and may receive a new node rarely if the situation arises.

                              <span>Monopoly GO seasons typically last anywhere from one to three months. During this time, you collect stickers to complete albums, which reward you with dice, cosmetic tokens, and a ton of cash for your landmark upgrades. Let&#x27;s find out what happens to any leftover stickers you have at the end of a season and whether your stars carry over to the next.


What happens to sticker stars when a season ends in Monopoly GO?


What happens to your stars at the end of a Monopoly GO season depends on the season itself. For example, while the previous Monopoly Origins season turned your stars into a vault for the next album set, the current Making Music season converts your stars into dice rolls. So far, each season has had different conversions for stars, and it&#x27;s unknown what Monopoly Games will do once it ends later this year.


For the Making Music season and album set, any leftover stars you have will convert to dice rolls. One star equals one dice roll, with the maximum being 700 stars for 750 dice rolls. In other words, if you don&#x27;t plan to purchase a last-minute vault for extra stickers, you&#x27;ll at least start Monopoly Games with extra dice.


Overall, this is a solid conversion rate compared to what you get from vaults. With each vault, you can get a maximum of 230, 420, and 575 dice, while the star-to-dice exchange at the season&#x27;s end can give you far more. On the flip side, you can also get extra stickers by buying vaults, but this comes at the risk of not getting what you need to complete your albums. You can also give sticker stars to friends if they want to take a shot at an expensive vault for extra cards.

                              <span>The Nuno Mendes Make Your Mark is now live in EA FC 24, and interestingly, EA Sports has offered it in the form of an objective. 


In simple words, everyone will be able to obtain this card by completing all the tasks that are part of the objective set. However, it&#x27;s important to understand the conditions associated with all the tasks, which will help players complete them quicker (and unlock the new promo card sooner). 


EA FC 24 Nuno Mendes Make Your Mark objective tasks


The latest objective set has eight different tasks, and all of them have to be completed in the Champions game mode.

Play 3: Play 3 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Play 6: Play 6 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Play 9: Play 9 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Play 11: Play 11 matches in any Champions Game Mode while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Win 4: Win 4 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Win 6: Win 6 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Win 10: Win 10 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.


Win 12: Win 12 matches in Champions Finals while having a Full Squad of players from Argentina.



Completing the EA FC 24 Nuno Mendes Make Your Mark objective won&#x27;t be easy as getting 12 wins in Champions Finals, only using Argentine cards, is pretty difficult. However, the 95-rated LB item is pretty meta, and obtaining such an item for free is well worth the extra effort.

How to become a Vet in BitLife


Becoming a veterinarian in BitLife requires graduating from university with either a chemistry or biology degree before completing veterinary school. Graduating with any other degree type, including those under the science umbrella, will still make you unqualified for veterinary school, so chemistry or biology are your best options.

                              <span>Taking its inspiration from the Shunsui Kyoraku character from Bleach, Theatre is a Shikai/Bankai Element for Shinigami in Type Soul. It’s a rather powerful one, so let&#x27;s take a closer look at it.


Theatre is a Legendary Shikai Element. This means that it has a drop rate of 3%. Once you receive your Shikai, if it’s not the one you want (which I assume is Theatre in this case) you’ll need to use a reroll to try your luck again.


Getting Shikai is an early task for Shinigami. For full instructions, you can check here. Then in order to get Bankai, you’ll need to jump a great many more hurdles, which are outlined right over here.


Shikai


Z - Kageoni - This causes you to teleport behind your opponent with an opening attack. It will ragdoll the opponent and can be followed up with a combo.


X - Wraith - A quicker but less flashy teleport that will move you in front of your opponent with an attack.


C - Iro Oni - This puts you in a stance. If your opponent hits you while you’re in this stance, you’ll teleport (of course) and hit them from behind, causing them to ragdoll.


Bankai


T - Plague - This is an AOE (area of effect) move that will mark all the enemies in your vicinity. After a few moments, it will stun and damage the enemies.


G - Final Play - This has a long(ish) windup that then releases a massive slash in front of your character. It guard breaks anyone in range and does massive damage.

Acquiring this card is pretty simple - complete all the tasks that are part of the SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. Weah has received a new promo card after a long time in Ultimate Team (his last one was during the Radioactive promo). Let&#x27;s take a look at all the tasks and their conditions.

Not only has its value never dropped, but every content creator I follow has nothing bad to say about it, often using boxes for giveaways. 


That&#x27;s why, when Wizards of the Coast announced Modern Horizons 3, I knew I needed to get in on it and pay attention. It would hopefully be the new standard for sets in Magic: The Gathering until Modern Horizons 4. Now that it&#x27;s out, we know that this set absolutely lived up to our extremely high expectations.

                              <span>In the right hands, Hollowburden in Type Soul can be a deadly weapon. It has a two-staged crit that can be difficult to defend against if you land it correctly. Our tier list has it at an A rank only because it requires a particular build.


Hollowburden is a Mythic weapon, which means it’s among the rarest in Type Soul with a 3% drop rate. In order to get Hollowburden, you need to be on the Arrancar path, meaning you need to be a Hollow. These come from pulls using Hollow Boxes gained by buying them after a raid. Unfortunately, there isn’t much you can do to improve your chances of getting one, so you’ll need to grind raids until you get lucky.


Otherwise, you can try to find someone to trade with. If you have a different Mythic weapon and would prefer to swap it out for a Hollowburden, you may be able to find someone who will oblige.


How to use Hollowburden in Type Soul


If you manage to get your hands on Hollowburden, then you may find it a bit unwieldy to use. Generally, you want to be using Kendo because it provides useful skills to supplement its somewhat weird function.


Essentially, Hollowburden’s critical will cause your character to leap backward pretty far. As I mentioned earlier, however, it’s a two-stage critical, so recasting will jump you back forward in a follow-up attack.


It’s a strange maneuver. Some players favor it, others can’t get a handle on it. Considering its rarity, it can be disappointing if you don’t click with it, so consider this your warning.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Raven Software has dropped a nerf to reduce the effectiveness of C4 explosives, and while some Warzone players are delighted, a vocal group is not pleased with the decision. 


In a tweet late on June 18, Raven confirmed they had &quot;shipped a minor update that includes changes to C4.&quot; The patch reduced the explosive&#x27;s throw velocity by 15%, brought its radius down from eight to seven meters, and toned down outer radius damage from 155 to 138. 




C4 has always been useful, and at times has been dominant in the meta. Most often, they are used to eliminate downed opponents, as you can simply throw one in the general direction of an injured enemy, press your trigger, and blow them back to the lobby. 


Recently though, they&#x27;ve been used more often as an offensive weapon against opponents who are not downed, and players were complaining about their range and the damage output, so it&#x27;s no surprise that many of the comments in response were in favor. 


However, there were dissenting voices too, with some calling it &quot;lame,&quot; while others suggesting they should have been focusing on other things, like the upcoming nerf for the Kar98k or issues with anti-cheat or the game&#x27;s party system. 


For some, the nerfs simply don&#x27;t go far enough, with a player named Tom responding: &quot;That&#x27;s barely a change at all, still going to be overpowered.&quot;


Still, it&#x27;s an improvement on days gone by, when the C4 was so powerful that you couldn&#x27;t spot an opponent without seeing a C4 flying through the air toward you. This nerf isn&#x27;t going to make them unusable, but should make them a little more balanced. If you can throw one and get it at your enemy&#x27;s feet, you&#x27;ll still be able to blow them to smithereens, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest ditching them from your loadouts just yet.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3 is full of interesting opportunities to jam out to Metallica music, drive cars through high-speed portals, and take over massive war buses. If you&#x27;re looking to defeat some bosses and get your hands on some fun turrets, then the War Bus is what you&#x27;re looking for.


Where to find a War Bus in Fortnite


During your matches, you can find a War Bus accompanying one of two NPCs: The Machinist and Megalo Don. When you first enter your Fortnite match, you&#x27;ll find the two boss icons on your map. They&#x27;ll either sit in their respective bases and defend their territory or patrol the map alongside the War Bus. Your goal is to spot one that&#x27;s patrolling the map and land near them without getting bombarded by turrets and NPC shots.

Once you approach a patrolling group, you&#x27;ll typically spot the Machinist or Megalo Don driving their cars, with the War Bus following close behind. They&#x27;ll all become hostile when you approach, so watch your shields and health to make sure you don&#x27;t get eliminated immediately. You may also spot players nearby, so watch for them, too.

Depending on your current quest goal, you may be looking to ride on the War Bus, take damage, or inflict damage to it. The easiest way to deal damage to it is to shoot at it, use Nitro Fists against it, or crash down using Ride the Lightning. Alternatively, if you&#x27;re fine with taking some damage, you can let it run you over or let nearby NPCs use the War Bus turrets. 


As for riding the War Bus, you&#x27;ll have to eliminate the NPCs controlling the turrets before using them yourself. Using the turret will complete the weekly quest instantly, allowing you to either use the turrets to attack others or quickly hop off and continue with the rest of the match.

                              <span>Black Elixir in Roblox’s Type Soul is an item that, er, itemizes Ultra Skills. That is to say, it will turn an Ultra Skill into an item. You can then hand that item over to other players or just hold onto it to save for later. It’s an Ultra Skill in your pocket.


The bad news is that Black Elixir is a Mythical rarity item. To get it, you need to participate in clan wars and hope for the best. You can also trade for it if you can find a player magnanimous enough to accept a trade.


The better way to get it, on the other hand, is to use a code. You can check our code guide to see if one is available now. At the time of writing, you can get a Powered Black Elixir, which I’ll explain in a moment.


As a note, Black Elixir doesn’t work on Formless or Yamato. If you try, it will just fail, and the Black Elixer will be gone, which sounds painful.


How to get Powered Black Elixir in Type Soul


There’s an upgraded Black Elixir in Type Soul, the Powered Black Elixir. This is similar to the basic Black Elixir, but it instead turns your Fighting Style into an item. Again, this is so you can trade it or just keep it in your pocket to reapply later.


To get Powered Black Elixir, you’ll need to visit Myrnite in Karakura Town. You’ll find them out in the greenhouses wearing a white suit. Not the best outfit to do gardening in. Myrnite won’t talk to you unless you have the Black Elixir in your inventory, as well as 350,000 kan. They will then take your money and provide you with Powered Black Elixir.


Again, the alternative to this rigamarole is to get a player to trade it to you, which probably will be even more expensive.

This success appears to have attracted scrutiny, however, as the game&#x27;s developer has had to issue a statement about how Banana isn&#x27;t a scam of some kind, as reported by Eurogamer.


For anyone not in the know, you can earn bananas (either by clicking enough times or waiting long enough), which can then be sold on the Steam marketplace. While most only go for a few cents, there are reports of people spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on these bananas, even though they don&#x27;t do anything in-game. As such, members of t…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been keeping up with Elden Ring&#x27;s spin-off manga, Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree, you may be disappointed to know that it will be skipping next month&#x27;s update. However, the author has a perfectly understandable and relatable reason... he wants to play Shadow of the Erdtree.


For anyone who wasn&#x27;t aware, Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree is an adaptation of the game, but is more of a comedy story starring an original protagonist. It&#x27;s been getting new chapters biweekly; in fact, a new one dropped earlier today. As spotted by Automaton, author Nikiichi Tobita has opted to take some time off to enjoy the new Elden Ring DLC, which is scheduled to launch tomorrow (or on Friday depending on your timezone). This means the manga won&#x27;t be getting a new chapter on July 19 as initially expected.




You can&#x27;t be mad with him for his decision. How many of us have booked time off work to play a hot, new video game? How many of us have booked time off specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree? People have been clamouring for more Elden Ring since the game launched in 2022 and, based on all the reviews, it sounds like the wait will be worth it. Plus, writing and drawing manga chapters on a regular basis must be exhausting work, so Tobita is probably due a break anyway. Playing the DLC may also give him new ideas for future manga chapters.


Would you believe this isn&#x27;t even the only Elden Ring manga? Just last week, publisher Bandai Namco announced a second one titled Elden Ring: Distant Stories from The Lands Between (via Famitsu) and while it&#x27;ll also be a comedy, the focus will be on the various NPCs players have met in the Lands Between. Serialisation will begin on July 4, but there&#x27;s no mention of an official English translation. Since Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree has been localised for Western fans, hopefully this second manga will follow suit.

                              <span>When you think of horror gaming, chances are you picture Resident Evil in one of its many forms. From its humble beginnings as a puzzle-based zombie game that took cues from Alone in the Dark and Sweet Home, Capcom&#x27;s survival series has become almost the final word in scary video gaming. There&#x27;s not much that comes close to it in terms of worldwide success and brand recognition.


With that, I&#x27;m going to attempt to rank all the mainline Resident Evil games that have been released over the decades (almost 30!) based purely on their sales figures. Now, there are a couple of things I want to clear up before I get started.


First off: there seems to be some debate about whether the likes of Revelations and Revelations 2 count as &quot;main games&quot; in the series. As such, I won&#x27;t be discussing them,…</span>

                              <span>Video game remakes are all the rage nowadays, and with the Fallout series enjoying a boon in popularity thanks to the Amazon TV show, some might think Bethesda should put out a remake of one of the older Fallout games. Especially since Fallout 5 won&#x27;t be a thing for a very, very, very long time. Surprisingly, Bethesda&#x27;s own Todd Howard has shot down the possibility of remaking either of the first two Fallout games.


Earlier this week, Howard spoke with YouTuber MrMattyPlays about the future of the Fallout series (via VGC), where he was asked if Bethesda would ever remake the original Fallout games. Those first two games are quite different to their successors, being isometric turn-based RPGs. Ever since Bethesda bought the IP from InterPlay Productions, though, the Fallout games have been…</span>

                              <span>Warzone has a storied history of &quot;pay to win&quot; weapons and skins that have dominated the meta, and YouTuber and expert JoeWo thinks he&#x27;s discovered the latest in that long line of annoyingly good guns. 


If you&#x27;ve purchased the Season 4 Battle Pass, you may have noticed the Poisoned Caress BlackCell blueprint for the AMR9. While it may not look like anything too special to begin with, this special version of the SMG comes with one very specific upgrade: The iron sights. 


&quot;It makes the iron sights absolutely broken,&quot; the YouTuber explained. &quot;That is the number one problem with the AMR9, [they&#x27;re] probably the worst in Call of Duty history if you don&#x27;t have this blueprint. They&#x27;re absolutely horrible.&quot;


With the blueprint attached, however, JoeWo says the changed iron sights are &quot;some of the cleanest we have for any SMG.&quot; You can take a look at the video below, timestamped to 29:31, to compare. 




If this sounds like your cup of tea, then JoeWo also dropped the meta loadout for the gun right now, so you can put together the best class to make the most of the newly improved sights. The blueprint can be found in Sector 11 of the Battle Pass.



Muzzle: ZEHM35 Compensated Flash Hider


Underbarrel: XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop


Stock: JAK Cut Throat


Rear Grip: Phantom Grip


Magazine: 50 Round Mag



While this definitely has a big advantage over the regular version of the gun, the good news is that it isn&#x27;t super overpowered like other &quot;pay-to-win&quot; items in the past. Who can forget the notorious Roze skin that blended into the shadows, or the Gaia skin which was almost impossible to see at times? Let&#x27;s pray we never see anything like that ever again.

The Jade Shadows questline is the latest added in Warframe, and if you&#x27;re floundering with the new choices presented along the journey, we&#x27;ve got explainers to help. 


Stop here now for everything beyond will be spoilers related to the new quest involving the Stalker and Jade.


Should you name the baby Sirius or Orion in Warframe?


After being spared by the overwhelming barrage of shots, the Stalker escapes, with his child in his arms. Not yet named, you, the player, are now tasked with naming the child. So, do you name them Sirius or Orion?

                              <span>Once you&#x27;ve completed The Final Shape&#x27;s campaign in Destiny 2, you&#x27;ll gain access to the Exotic Quest to unlock one of the best Swords in the game Ergo Sum. That Sword can be improved upon with its Exotic Catalyst, but you&#x27;ll need to work to get it. 


An Exotic Catalyst acts as an additional ability or Trait for Exotic weapons in Destiny 2. They must first be unlocked; then, quests or requirements must be met to help them reach their true potential. An Exotic weapon as powerful as Ergo Sum with a Catalyst is something to be proud of and something for enemies to fear. It&#x27;ll make light work of even Salvation&#x27;s Edge in the right hands.

                              <span>Since XDefiant first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. 


Ubisoft confirmed that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience.  


Team Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as Modern Warfare 3, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. 




XDefiant features two different types of maps. Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. 


As for other highly requested game modes, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin previously confirmed on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update.

This console is a special edition of the Nintendo Switch Lite, possibly the best ever made. In the past, we&#x27;ve had slight variations on the design, the most recent of which was for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but only the Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and Sword and Shield Editions really went anywhere with their designs. The Hyrule Edition kicks things up a notch with a striking look for what looks to be an amazing game.

                              <span>Ubisoft expedited XDefiant&#x27;s weapon leveling process by decreasing the XP requirement. However, to maintain player engagement, the development team made the weapon mastery unlock process harder, dividing players. 


As part of the June 18 XDefiant update, Ubisoft lowered the XP needed to level up a primary weapon from 3.500 to 3,000 and a secondary weapon from 1,500 to 1,000. As a counterbalance, the Bronze camo level was increased from 50 to 100, Silver from 75 to 150, and Gold from 100 to 200. 


Previously, XDefiant developer Patrick ‘ACHES’ Price explained that one kill equals 100 XP, meaning it took around 35 kills per level. Considering that there are 18 primary weapons and all attachments aren&#x27;t unlocked until level 43, that&#x27;s a steep undertaking for a player of any skill level. Mul…</span>

When building a kernel targeted for a specific device/platform with a given number of CPU cores, the compiler can optimize CPU mask routines and shrink the size of the resulting kernel image rather than having to accommodate up to a dynamic upper-limit for the number of CPU cores to be found at boot time. Linus Torvalds himself has turned to demoting this CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS option further to avoid confusion...</span>

                              <span>The release of Sonic Generations in 2011 gave players a series-wide greatest hits remake package to celebrate 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog. Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it&#x27;s not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic&#x27;s abilities, but we&#x27;ve seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…</span>

                              <span>Metal Slug Attack actually began as a mobile tower defense game for iOS and Android devices many years ago, but today, as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Summer Direct presentation, it was revealed the game is getting &quot;reloaded&quot; for just about every platform. Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

Our initial reaction to The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom reveal at the June Nintendo Direct was something along the lines of &quot;Ahhhh-WHHHAAAAAAAAA&quot;.
If you had asked us for some of the game&#x27;s distinguishing features after that first watch, we&#x27;d probably be able to mutter, &quot;Hero Zelda, er, magic rod,&quot; and, after a long pause, &quot;... beds&quot;.

Developer Cococucumber has established itself as a dependable indie studio over the past few years. Specialising in accessible throwbacks, it adds a fresh spin on old genre formats. Although its latest title Ravenlok is (pun intended) locked away behind Xbox exclusivity, Switch owners can finally try the second in the dev&#x27;s self-styled ‘Voxel Trilogy’ - Echo Generation.
A nostalgic and charmingly funny adventure/RPG hybrid, it takes the beautiful voxel style of the developer&#x27;s 2019 title Riverbond, and applies it to the bizarre summer holiday of a group of suburban kids. Tipping a hat to the point-and-click classics of Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer, there&#x27;s also more than a little reminder of EarthBound in its creepy view of suburbia.

During Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct showcase, the incredibly promising The Hundred Line -Last Defence Academy- was revealed from developer Too Kyoo Games and publisher Aniplex.
Born via a collaboration between Danganronpa series writer Kazutaka Kodaka and Zero Escape creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, the game is set to launch in 2025, but according to an interview with Famitsu (thanks, Automaton), it seems the project had some difficulties progressing, eventually putting Too Kyoo Games in debt.

But, later this week, we&#x27;ll be getting an update regarding this rerelease of the GameCube era cult classic (thanks to our friends at Push Square!).
The official Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 (remember that game...?) Twitter account announced that we&#x27;ll be getting some news about the Anniversary Edition during the Limited Run Games showcase this Thursday, 20th June, at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST.

When Nintendo closed out its latest Direct presentation with the full reveal of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the world briefly got a little bit louder as fans celebrated the glorious return of one of the company’s most revered franchises. Finally, after its initial announcement back in 2017, Prime 4 is scheduled to launch in 2025, and it looks spectacular.
Although an overwhelming majority reacted to the trailer with excitement and anticipation, there are also those who felt disappointed, citing the game’s similarities to previous Prime entries, both in terms of its visuals and gameplay.

The Albanian right winger, Jasir Asani, rocked up to the fixture in a pair of custom Super Mario-inspired boots. The design proudly displays the Nintendo mascot on the outside, while gold coins adorn the teal background.

                              <span>Can we get a new amiibo too, then?
It looks like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have amiibo support when it launches on 26th September 2024. At least, that&#x27;s what the game&#x27;s Japanese website says.
Near the bottom of the official page on Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese website, we and many other fans have spotted the little amiibo symbol next to the game&#x27;s box art and release date. We&#x27;re not too surprised, given that the Link&#x27;s Awakening remake — which uses the same art style — also has amiibo support, but it certainly has us thinking &quot;Hey, can we get a Zelda amiibo in the same style as the Link&#x27;s Awakening one?&quot;.

Walking into the Devolver’s booth for The Plucky Squire at Summer Game Fest Play Days, we felt like we were going back to our childhood. There was a huge, colourful mural on the wall, depicting All Possible Future’s upcoming adventure game in front of us. A cute, cosy couch was positioned to our left; soft plush, and a deep orangey-red. There was a bright geometric-print rug on the floor. And a little desk with a book titled ‘The Plucky Squire’, written by E.N. Arthur and published by Peanut, was tucked in the corner. The finishing touch? A big TV with the game glowing from the screen, an Xbox controller, and a PC tucked away in a cabinet. It felt like the childhood den of our dreams.
The book itself was empty – sorry to James Turner, co-director of The Plucky Squire, that we’ve revealed the secret – but that’s kind of the point. The Plucky Squire is a game about discovering the story of hero Jot, preserving that story, and saving creativity, all to preserve the innocence and imagination of kids. In the game itself, it’s a boy called Sam, whose favourite book is the titular tome, but in reality, we couldn’t help but think of kids everywhere and want to protect that creativity that youth gives us – and that age can sometimes take away.

Donkey Kong Country Returns is returning for a third time early next year and it seems we might already know who is behind the latest HD iteration. According to some official documentation which has already been spotted by many fans online, the Polish team Forever Entertainment SA (Panzer Dragoon: Remake) is helping out with the upcoming Switch release - with today marking the &quot;launch of the marketing campaign for the game&quot;.
While the original developer Retro Studios currently has its hands full with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (due out at some point in 2025), Forever Entertainment has seemingly been busy visually enhancing DKCR and also adding in some other extra bonuses like the extra levels from the Nintendo 3DS outing.

In case you somehow missed it earlier on, Nintendo has finally rolled out its &quot;mature&quot; rated Nintendo 64 app for Switch Online users here in the West. This was announced alongside the return of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Rare&#x27;s legendary title Perfect Dark - &quot;now with online multiplayer&quot;.
This app is one extra tile on your Home menu and there&#x27;s no way to merge these games with the existing N64 releases, but it is what it is. On a more positive note, this does mean even more mature-themed Nintendo 64 titles could one day make their way across to the Expansion Pack service (come on, Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day).

                              <span>Zelda historians are already linking the dots...

One of the most exciting games announced during the latest Nintendo Direct was The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - a brand new entry in Link&#x27;s top-down adventures, where you&#x27;ll be taking on the role of Princess Zelda after Link goes missing.

The latest Nintendo Direct broadcast was packed with all sorts of Switch-related goodness, and early on in the show, NES fans were treated to another look at the upcoming release Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition.
This title will be arriving next month on 18th July 2024, with a collector&#x27;s edition also on the way, and as part of the latest trailer, Nintendo teased some of the speedrunning challenges, the online leaderboards, the Legend challenges - like completing Super Mario Bros. in one go, and a survival mode.

                              <span>Look, who knows when we’ll see Fallout 5 - there’s an increasingly less-than-zero chance we’ll all be living in a real post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland by the time Bethesda get around to revealing anything, if their deliberately slow approach to The Elder Scrolls 6 (it’s been nearly THIRTEEN years since Skyrim) is much to go by. Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in multiple seasons of a television show, in Fortnite, and now in Call of Duty.

                              <span>If you were playing Final Fantasy XIV in December 2021, you will remember the launch of its last expansion Endwalker - though not for all the right reasons. The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

                              <span>When it comes to the ultimate showdown of all-time great fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 might well take my personal bet for being the best of the best. I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

We&#x27;ll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He reckons it&#x27;s thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age&#x27;s combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.

                              <span>Yesterday, we learned that Sims-like Life By You had been canceled, and its developers Paradox Tectonic had been shut down by parent company Paradox Interactive. Later the same day, game designer Willem Delventhal shared more a detailed account of his experience working on the game through to its cancellation, via LinkedIn.

                              <span>Tales Of The Shire unfolds in a world without shadow. There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

                              <span>Like many I’m sure, I have extremely fond memories of the original Fallout games, 2 especially. I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

                              <span>When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. &quot;Gobshite&quot; became &quot;bastard&quot;. The &quot;polis&quot; were localised as the &quot;police&quot;. And every &quot;yersel&quot; sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became &quot;yourself&quot;. Well, turns out that&#x27;s the result of the game defaulting to &quot;International English&quot; for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There&#x27;s another option, says one of the game&#x27;s developers.

And it&#x27;s by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there&#x27;s one thing that really gets me going, it&#x27;s a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

                              <span>There is very little in this world that would get between me and playing an RPG made by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, double for one with a soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form. Have a trailer.

                              <span>Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993&#x27;s Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It&#x27;s a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don&#x27;t talk about their sacrifices enough. It&#x27;s out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020&#x27;s Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I&#x27;ve got a trailer&#x27;s worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

                              <span>Less than a day after publisher Paradox Interactive canceled Life by You, the company announced that the game&#x27;s developer Paradox Tectonic is shutting down.


The news was delivered earlier this morning by the publisher. Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, called the move, which affects 24 people, &quot;difficult and drastic,&quot; and shutting down the studio was a &quot;tough decision.&quot; 


&quot;This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,&quot; Wester said. &quot;Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.&quot;

Paradox Tectonic is shutting down after Life by You cancellation


Paradox announced the cancellation of Life by You yesterday. In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: &quot;A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release.&quot; The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down The Lamplighters League for approximately $23 million a week after the game launched. 


It has been troubling all around. Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s shuttering feels like another stone in the road for an industry that has already experienced a lot of job loss in 2024 — and we&#x27;re only halfway through the year. Just yesterday, before the news of the Life by You cancellation, Embracer Group announced the closure of Alone in the Dark (2024) developer Pieces Interactive. Microsoft closed down the Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin (along with Alpha Dog Games) ahead of its big June showcase. Needless to say, the move dampened the excitement before the show.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

Ace Attorney Investigations Collection comprises two games: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit. Neither game has been on PC before, and the latter has never been released outside of Japan.

                              <span>Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. &quot;Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he&#x27;s already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,&quot; notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. &quot;So he&#x27;s kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.&quot;

                              <span>If nothing else, Workers &amp; Resources Colon Soviet Republic will give anyone an appreciation of the incredible complexity and difficulty of building and maintaining a city. On another day I might call it the first ever city building game.
Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn&#x27;t realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It&#x27;s about co-ordinating all your pieces so they&#x27;ll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don&#x27;t organise its parts. It is… a lot. It&#x27;s too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the &quot;themes or core elements&quot; of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a &quot;short-term way&quot;, by the experience of having a daughter.

                              <span>I&#x27;d been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, &quot;It&#x27;s hefty, but I think that&#x27;s probably pushing it&quot;.
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game&#x27;s Lands Between, but it&#x27;s knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring&#x27;s finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn&#x27;t that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there&#x27;s a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

Ok, so the visual component helps too.

You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. &quot;Habbo Hotel is back!&quot; is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

                              <span>Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the &quot;same&quot; money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I&#x27;d save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money&#x27;s worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I&#x27;d eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

                              <span>Life By You, the Sims-like management game previously troubled by several delays, has been canceled by Paradox Interactive, and Californian studio Paradox Tectonic have been shut down. The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

                              <span>The trailer and Collector&#x27;s Edition give some hints.
How are all of the RPG fans doing after that Nintendo Direct, hey? One of the highlights of the show was Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, which made its long-awaited return after years of silence. We got music, a new trailer, and a release date of 14th November.
We also know some new features are coming to the game. Nintendo Life had the opportunity to go hands-on with the remake, and we were told by Square Enix that the job system will be &quot;modernised&quot;. We weren&#x27;t told what that meant exactly, but today&#x27;s trailer — and the newly-revealed Collector&#x27;s Edition — may provide a few hints.

                              <span>So much more than &quot;Sanrio meets Animal Crossing&quot;.
“One World, Connecting Smiles.” That’s the tagline Sanrio, the company responsible for creating Hello Kitty, established back in 2021. Its brand is all about &#x27;Minna Nakayoku&#x27;, which means &#x27;all of us friends&#x27; or &#x27;Getting Along Together&#x27;. Unity, friendship, and love encompass the world of Sanrio, and it’s worked. For me, Hello Kitty has always been that unifying figure – an icon, kind of like a cuter Barbie, who is capable of anything but always puts her friends first. I had Hello Kitty Dream World figures, where the eponymous cat had a mushroom house, a pineapple juice bar (complete with a pineapple-costumed figure), and even a dolphin yacht. There was also a bee costume figure with detachable bee wings. What’s not to love?
Hello Kitty is one of the biggest brands in the world (for context, Hello Kitty grossed more merch money than Frozen, Batman, and Sesame Street in 2018). So it might be a surprise that she’s never really had a successful video game, despite starring in many, dating all the way back to the Famicom. That is, until 2023’s Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Well, well, that was a packed one, wasn&#x27;t it?
We&#x27;ve gotta be honest, expectations were sensibly low around these parts. For every wild card dream we had of a new Mario &amp; Luigi or that 2D Zelda we&#x27;ve been hoping Grezzo would make as a follow-up to Link&#x27;s Awakening, there was a wise voice in our ear warning us to be cautious and realistic. Switch launched back in 2017 and Nintendo has said there&#x27;s a new hardware announcement coming in a matter of months — surely all the big-name games are getting banked for the new system&#x27;s launch, right?

This one will see you embarking on a journey through a decaying wasteland in the hope of preventing the apocalypse — no pressure there then, eh? You&#x27;ll be building a party and working through five different &#x27;Confessions&#x27;, each with its own challenges and bosses.

Appearing briefly at the end of today&#x27;s announcement for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo revealed an all-new &#x27;Hyrule Edition&#x27; Switch Lite console which will be launching alongside the game on 26th September 2024.
This might just be the most eye-catching design of all the special edition Switch Lites. The &#x27;Hyrule Edition&#x27; console brandishes a gorgeous gold casing reminiscent of that sweet GBA SP model or Link Between Worlds 3DS XL, with the Hylian crest proudly displayed on its underside.

In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software&#x27;s most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game&#x27;s many fans.

                              <span>Hot off the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.</span>

                              <span>We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you&#x27;ll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it&#x27;s also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it&#x27;s up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players&#x27; first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new &quot;hand-drawn character visuals&quot; for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</span>

                              <span>In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.


The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today&#x27;s announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994&#x27;s X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</span>

                              <span>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she&#x27;s become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it&#x27;s up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there&#x27;s no clear indication that it is connected to Link&#x27;s Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create &quot;echoes&quot; of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…</span>

                              <span>We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro&#x27;s other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The long-awaited Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake appeared during today&#x27;s highly anticipated Nintendo Direct. We learned much more about the upcoming game, including its release date, which falls in November. On top of that, during Summer Game Fest 2024, we spent about 45 minutes checking out the upcoming retro remake of one of the most beloved and important Dragon Quest games of all time.
In Dragon Quest III, which takes place years prior to the first two games in the series, you step into the shoes of the only child of Ortega, a great hero who failed to defeat Baramos, an …</span>

The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.
The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

If you haven&#x27;t checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.
Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth&#x27;s greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.
You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you&#x27;ve already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian&#x27;s ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its June 2024 Nintendo Direct presentation with the surprise reveal of a new Mario &amp; Luigi game. This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a &quot;seafaring adventure&quot; that will include new evolved &quot;Bros moves&quot;.


The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</span>

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…</span>

                              <span>Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars&#x27; Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming&#x27;s past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company&#x27;s past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.</span>

                              <span>Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park&#x27;s 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park&#x27;s logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.</span>

While not all blocking requests were honored, this is the first &#x27;dynamic&#x27; order, allowing the targeted domains to be updated.

                              <span>Elden Ring fans are likely counting down the seconds until the release of its hotly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion this Friday. For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion&#x27;s content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers and don&#x27;t plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you&#x27;ll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don&#x27;t care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom&#x27;s big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…</span>

                              <span>Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced its previously confirmed summer Direct will air tomorrow, June 18. The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.
The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company&#x27;s fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it&#x27;s likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.</span>

                              <span>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they&#x27;re quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Black Myth: Wukong is an action role-playing game that closely follows the events of Wu Cheng’en’s seminal novel Journey to the West. The work, based on Chinese mythology and Buddhist folklore, follows a monk who meets a spirit called Sun Wukong, often called Monkey King, during his search for sacred religious texts. While its central narrative is still unknown, Game Science’s upcoming Soulslike depicts Wukong’s encounters with Yaoguai, various creatures and demons in Chinese myth, set within stunning Eastern landscapes…</span>

                              <span>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

                              <span>Fumes has starred in a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It&#x27;s an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

                              <span>The perpetually scarlet-faced and jovially maladroit folk of Embracer have done their usual vaudeville comedy routine of spinning around with negative-dollar signs in their eyes and trampling on another game development studio - in this case, Pieces Interactive, creators of the recent Alone In The Dark reboot. The Swedish studio&#x27;s website is now a tombstone, bearing the dates 2007-2024. Oopsy-daisy!

                              <span>Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss&#x27; office for a severe dressing-down. It&#x27;s a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors&#x27; performances are so spot-on, that it&#x27;d feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

Shovel Knight, the retro platformer that started it all (it all being everything from a roguelike spin-off to a Dead Cells cameo) turns 10 this month, and Yacht Club Games are releasing a ultimate edition to celebrate. Entitled the ‘Shovel Of Hope DX’, this definitive-me-doo bundles in the original game with old and new features like saving and rewinding, over 20 playable characters, local and online co-op, and new modes. Grab your shovel and prepare to dig for the trailer, then look foolish as you realise it’s directly below this paragraph.

                              <span>&quot;Two&#x27;s company, three&#x27;s a crowd,&quot; the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely &quot;three&#x27;s a moderately balanced squad, two&#x27;s a massive liability&quot;? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare&#x27;s Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which &quot;only&quot; allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. It&#x27;s another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more &quot;intimate&quot;, and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&amp;A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

Many have fallen to it, but I will overcome. Oh, Elden Ring? I was talking about male pattern baldness. It will eventually destroy all that was once beautiful about my hairline, but at least I’ll have five fancy new hairdos to pick from when the open world RPG’s newest free update releases this Thursday, 20th of June. There’s also some QOL tweaks to inventory management and summoning pools, but I can’t wear those, can I?

Due to a shortage of hands at the pump and persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster. Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself. Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.

                              <span>Organizace IuRe (Iuridicum Remedium) varuje před návrhem, který představilo belgické předsednictví Rady EU. Populární služby jako Messenger, WhatsApp nebo Signal by dle něj bylo možné plně používat až po odsouhlasení kontroly komunikace. Ta by měla zamezit šíření dětské pornografie. Podle IuRe by však taková kontrola přinesla hlavně závažný dopad na soukromí uživatelů.</span>

He was quickly discovered, but despite patient attempts to explain that it&#x27;s  been several years since he was last here, and as per tradition he&#x27;s now dead to us, we&#x27;ve so far been unable to dislodge him. Like the smiley face hidden in the above image, he&#x27;s just... there. So I decided, hell, let&#x27;s hear what he&#x27;s playing this weekend as well.
Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. 
The studio also states, “We&#x27;re committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn&#x27;t just another sequel - it&#x27;s a bold new adventure that will la…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Developer Arc System Works has revealed Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers, an anime adaptation based on its hit 2021 fighting game. Though there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight, Arc System Works says Sanzigen Studios is producing the anime. Notably, Sanzigen Studios is the same studio behind protagonist Sol Badguy&#x27;s &quot;Find Your Way&quot; music video in Guilty Gear Strive. 
As for what to expect from a plot perspective, Arc System Works has revealed little, though it says Dual Rulers will be at this year&#x27;s Anime Expo 2024 in July. 
&quot;Shigeru Morikawa (famous for Argonavis the Movie: Axia) will direct,&quot; the Dual Rulers announcement reads. &quot;Others attached to the project include Guilty Gear writer Norimitsu Kaihō for series composition and Seiji Mizushima (famous for Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Fullmetal Alchemist) as associate producer.&quot;

                              <span>Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop&#x27;s first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw&#x27;s release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder&#x27;s Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.
Alongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. 
Plus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has &quot;auto rock on,&quot; an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. 
Check all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: 


Lollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

After 10 years of storytelling, the overarching saga that was introduced in the original launch of Destiny has finally concluded. With The Final Shape, Bungie ties a bow on the vast majority of its lingering plotlines and questions and sets the stage for a new direction in subsequent releases. Ahead of that, this concluding chapter is extremely satisfying, offering a rousing, heartfelt, and character-driven wrap-up that does right by what has come before. From narrative to gameplay, this is not the installment that welcom…</span>

When I first played Astro&#x27;s Playroom on the PlayStation 5, I was blown away by its gorgeous art style, engaging level design, and overwhelming charm. Each level was so carefully packed with easter eggs and fun platforming challenges that I assumed it was a positive side-effect of the game&#x27;s short playtime; the only way so much delight could be crammed into each stage was because the development team only had so many levels to work with, so a longer game would probably feel less impressive. But after going hands-on with Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel from Team Asobi, I can …</span>

The E3 replacement included multiple online showcases and onsite events, each aimed at drumming up excitement for a flood of upcoming games. Which games rocked? Which ones sucked?

                              <span>There’ve been a ton of Jackbox Party Packs over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today&#x27;s idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I&#x27;ve had a tonne of fun with, when&#x27;s the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It&#x27;s a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year&#x27;s Keighleycon, and it&#x27;s one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it&#x27;s out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so&#x27;s time.

                              <span>Back in February, Graham wrote about potential redundancies at Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM following the cancellation of a standalone expansion to that game, codenamed X7. Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive People Make Games documentary. You can, and should, read PC Gamer’s report here.

                              <span>Popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy has gone &#x27;offline&#x27; overnight. While downtime is quite common for pirate sites, a mysterious statement by the team is open for interpretation, leading some to believe that it will not return anytime soon. Since the site is a prominent source of new movie and TV show releases, this is a big deal.

                              <span>The company behind notorious anti-tamper technology Denuvo, filed an interesting DMCA takedown notice at GitHub this week. According to Irdeto, unnamed parties cloned the company&#x27;s website, registered a similar domain, and ran their own mail server behind the scenes. A short investigation by TF suggests that the culprits may have known Irdeto would attempt to track them down and may have left Easter eggs along the way.

                              <span>Everywhere is a creative suite that aims to let players build their own 3D games - such as shooters, racing games, and platformers - without code. Instead, players can use a developer- and user-created asset library to build and &quot;remix&quot; game worlds, then publish them for other folks to play. 

Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

                              <span>Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown&#x27;s first story DLC got a two-second trailer during Ubisoft Forward on Monday, confirming its name and its coming release this September. Here&#x27;s a more specific release date that&#x27;ll matter more to some of you: The Lost Crown itself will come to Steam on August 8th.

                              <span>The latest Helldivers 2 patch is memorably titled 01.000.400, but for my money, it&#x27;s hovering on the  brink of being one of your gold-varnished &quot;X.0&quot; updates of note. It adds a fair few mechanics and makes various substantial adjustments to Arrowhead and Sony&#x27;s liberty-humping, cheerily xenocidal squad shooter.

                              <span>In the past I&#x27;ve described Phantom Blade Zero, the foetid and frantic new action-RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, as a Soulslike, and more specifically a Sekirolike. I must now hang my head and await the executioner&#x27;s ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero&#x27;s ambience and layouts owe something to From&#x27;s work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.

                              <span>Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft &#x27;em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it&#x27;s quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It&#x27;s possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018&#x27;s Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma. Getting rocket-speared in the bum was only the start of its worst day ever.

It’s from Antistatic Studios, who include former Cyberpunk 2077, Bioshock, and Borderlands devs among their ranks. The FPS lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on. You’ll need to join the game’s Discord if you want to play. Trailer below.

Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I&#x27;d be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a &quot;top down art adventure with light RPG elements&quot; that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.

As if the unholy swarm of trailers and game announcements from Summer Game Fest was not enough, this week the fearful megalords at Valve decided to drop their regular cavalcade of coming-soons onto their megastore. The beautiful (and terrifying) thing about Next Fest, of course, is the overwhelming number of demos that come out during the event. A small herd of video games are standing on my toes as we speak. But that&#x27;s okay, we are expert curators. Here&#x27;s a handy list of our nine favourite demos of the lot.

                              <span>In what is possibly the biggest scandal the UK has seen since the last time the price of Freddos went up, a digital rights campaigner is suing Valve for £656m in compensation, accusing the company of overcharging and anti-competitive behaviour. The accompanying website describes the collective action claim as a “ground-breaking legal action,” which is very gamer of them. 16 times the litigation, etc.

                              <span>Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive first arrived on the platform on April 30. 
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That&#x27;s quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada). 
Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May:
Sea of Thieves
Madden NFL 24
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III
Helldivers 2
NBA 2K24
MLB The Show 24
Stellar Blade
Fallout 4
Who’s Your Daddy?!
Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege
Grounded
Another Crab’s Treasure
Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
NHL 24
Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game
Rise of the Ronin
Assassin’s Creed Mirage
WWE 2K24
Elden Ring
For more on Sea of Thieves, we spoke to Rare to reflect on the series shortly before its PS5 launch. You can read that retrospective here.

The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay. 
The story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange. Max has moved far away from Arcadia Bay for a fresh start and now works as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University in upstate Vermont. She has sworn to never use her time-rewind ability again, and hasn&#x27;t since the first game&#x27;s conclusion. Despite this, Max’s power has evolved.

Growing up, I didn&#x27;t spend much time watching anime outside of the Pokémon animated series after school each day. However, friends kept telling me about this incredible show from Japan called Dragon Ball Z. While I have gone back and experienced the legendary anime in adulthood, as a kid, streaming wasn&#x27;t an option, so outside of catching a few episodes airing on Toonami, I was extremely late to the DBZ anime party. However, in early 2003, I went to my local game rental shop and picked up Dragon Ball Z: Budokai. For this reason, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai became the primary way I interacted with the Dragon …</span>

                              <span>PlayStation is rolling out an update in the coming weeks that will finally allow players to join a Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 consoles. Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. 
The update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. 


To start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center&#x27;s Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you&#x27;d like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you&#x27;re set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. 
This upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. 
Are you excited about this update? Let us know in the coming weeks!</span>

                              <span>A French court has ordered Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco to poison their DNS resolvers to prevent circumvention of blocking measures, targeting around 117 pirate sports streaming domains. The move is another anti-piracy escalation for broadcaster Canal+, which also has permission to completely deindex the sites from search engine results.

The enforcement actions show that the organization is on high alert. Meanwhile, the EU Intellectual Property Office adds support by clarifying that cheers of legitimate viewers &#x27;mean more&#x27; than those from pirates.

Several defendants are now on trial in Las Vegas in a case that generated 19TB of data and 175,000 pages of print discovery, and has taken five years to prepare. After accusing MPA and HBO executives of presenting prejudicial evidence to the jury, the lead defendant called for a mistrial; the government didn&#x27;t give an inch.

Whether you remember or not, this year’s long-awaited sequel Dragon Age: The Veilguard should have you covered, with the ability to carry over your story choices from the previous game and get a refresher on what happened last time around.

As it turns out, most players on Steam haven’t even progressed far enough in the original game to access the DLC - something publishers Bandai Namco have now issued a friendly FYI about.

I have no idea where the game came from - a dream, perhaps - but 30 years later, I still think about it as a perfectly formed way to lose hours on the PC without actually doing anything.

Not that it will get dirty forever.” I’m not sure I’ve ever felt the crushing weight of universal entropic decay so keenly as in that RPG maker textbox, nested upon Felvidek’s nicotine-stain hues. I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s not Silversun. Sit down, Brian. Let somebody else have a go at answering. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I&#x27;ve played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you&#x27;re being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven&#x27;t got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I&#x27;ll let the game&#x27;s designer tell you then.

                              <span>Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n&#x27; strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It&#x27;s got teeth, but it&#x27;s also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

Citizen Sleeper took me by surprise in 2022, giving me a rare new video game experience, both mechanically and narratively, and my dice-centric role-playing adventure has stuck with me since. I still think about my Sleeper and what they&#x27;re up to now. In a year where Elden Ring didn&#x27;t release, it would have been my game of the year with a bullet – read my Citizen Sleeper review here to find out why. Now, a little more than two years later, I&#x27;ve played parts of the opening hour of Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector and find myself desperate to play more. It brings bac…</span>

Despite being a flagship franchise, Atlus has never shied away from taking risks and experimenting with Shin Megami Tensei. Even without taking spinoffs like Persona or Devil Summoner into consideration, the “core” series has taken new forms and reinvented itself over multiple decades and platforms. 2021’s Shin Megami Tensei V was a prime example, both respecting its oppressive, hardcore roots while embracing Atlus’ evolving audience and conventional shifts in games as a whole. It only makes sense that in revisiting such a r…</span>

The lucky players who took a chance on 2021’s Before Your Eyes were rewarded with a well-written, highly emotional narrative adventure with a unique mechanical twist. Players control a departed soul traversing the afterlife who relives his entire life, and it can be played entirely by blinking, utilizing webcams to capture their optical input (though the best version is on PlayStation VR2). I loved it, writing in my review, “It’s a concept I’d love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldn’t be happier that something like this exists.” 
That sentiment was shared by Graham Parkes, who wrote Before Your Eyes and now serves as creative director and writer at Nice Dream. He a…</span>

                              <span>Square Enis has announced that Visions of Mana launches August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. 
For the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.
In the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character&#x27;s class to attune to different elements. They won&#x27;t be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player&#x27;s party in combat, according to the trailer. 
Check out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:


The standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector&#x27;s Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector&#x27;s edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector&#x27;s edition will not be available in the U.S. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the Visions of Mana Collector&#x27;s Edition: 
Visions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29.

                              <span>As part of a voluntary agreement with copyright holders, German Internet service providers must block structurally infringing websites. The list expanded recently with Romslab, a site that offers links to pirated games and emulators such as Yuzu and Ryujinx. Official records redact the name of the game company that requested the blockade, but several signs point in the direction of a 135-year-old Japanese corporation.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s solution to IPTV piracy is already operating beyond the limits of its design. Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country&#x27;s ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy&#x27;s blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a little sheepish about how much I&#x27;m looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It&#x27;s neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it&#x27;ll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That&#x27;s why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never played League Of Legends and I have no interest in doing so, but Arcane was superb. Set within the world of Riot&#x27;s MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix&#x27;s mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.

A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as &quot;the final chapter&quot;.

                              <span>It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a Trackmania player has finally beaten the racing game&#x27;s most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game&#x27;s community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.

                              <span>Good news, everybody! Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there&#x27;s a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

                              <span>I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid strategy antics of Metal Slug Tactics ever since it was first announced. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

                              <span>AI nowadays is big business and it&#x27;s pretty terrifying, honestly. FACEMINER captures both of these things well, as it sees you build a biometric data processing empire from scratch. And most scary of all, is you&#x27;ll relish upscaling your organisation as you mine mugshots. I mean, I went from, &quot;Hmmm, this is dubious&quot;, to a sicko excited by the fact I didn&#x27;t have to click much to harvest strangers&#x27; portraits. Nic wrote about it a while back, but I&#x27;d like to draw attention to it again as it&#x27;s very good.

Still, I’m not entirely un-thrilled to learn that stealth action game Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could be arriving as soon as the 17th of November this year, according to a hastily scrubbed X post by retailer GameStop. Thankfully, the folks at the (good, handsome) Ian Games Network grabbed the offending information square before it was deleted. Here’s said square:

It’s a figurative &quot;Go nuts,&quot; and given how much more this narrative-heavy, third-person exploration yarn seemingly has to give, it&#x27;s an attitude I’m seriously hoping holds firm throughout the full game.

Nearby to this now-famous site of grace camps a merry band of blood-cursed Albinaurics, as well as a stupid gross bird you can trick into killing itself over and over again. I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.

Whenever a legendary trio of game creators known for a single franchise embark on a new IP together, it rightfully captures a lot of attention. That’s exactly what director Katsura Hashino, art director Shigenori Soejima, and composer Shoji Meguro, the trio best known for the beloved Persona series, is doing with Metaphor: ReFantazio. Though it derives inspiration from many of Persona’s most prominent elements, Metaphor is a wholly new experience disconnected from the Persona franchise.
Taking place in the fantasy kingdom of Euchronia, Metaphor tells the tale of …</span>

                              <span>Madden NFL 25 (the new one, not the bizarrely titled 25th-anniversary entry of the same name from 2013) has found its cover athlete. Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.
The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.

EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details &quot;soon.&quot; 
Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year&#x27;s Madden NFL 24 here. For the first time in years, Madden won&#x27;t be EA&#x27;s only licensed football sim this year, as EA Sports College Football makes its comeback on July 19.

                              <span>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of Arcane, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show&#x27;s last.


Season 2 is billed as &quot;the final chapter&quot; and will center on Jinx&#x27;s attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won&#x27;t be the last animated tale based on the franchise. 
“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,&quot; said Linke. &quot;From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season. But Arcane is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”

                              <span>Developer BioWare has released the first official gameplay trailer for its upcoming RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Featuring more than 20 minutes of gameplay, this is the first look at the game&#x27;s action combat, the magical city of Minrathous, the player-character Rook, some of the companions who are joining Rook&#x27;s journey, how dialogue choices work, and more. 
In the gameplay trailer, which begins in Minrathous, we see returning fan favorites Varric Tethras and Lace Harding alongside newcomer companion Neve Gallus, a private detective mage, and Rook. Solas, the once-ally mage turned foe at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s Trespasser DLC, is attempting to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and the continent of Thedas. Our team, seemingly not quite the titular Veilguard just yet, is attempting to stop him. 
Check it out for yourself in the official gameplay trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below:


At just 20 minutes, this gameplay reveal is a tease of what&#x27;s to come in the final game when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this fall. However, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is Game Informer&#x27;s next cover story, and in the latest issue, you can get an exclusive in-depth look at what happens next in the game alongside new details about the extensive character creator, the game&#x27;s main hub location, the action combat, and so much more.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that &quot;addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game,&quot; but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.
A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker&#x27;s look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, which can be seen on PlayStation&#x27;s blog, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that &quot;is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old.&quot;

Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend.

                              <span>It’s been almost a decade since Rebel Galaxy ably picked up the sci-fi trading and exploration mantle handed down by Freelancer, but it looks like a successor to the serene galaxy-venturing vibes of both is finally upon us. Star Trucker is exactly what it sounds like, transplanting the chill A-to-Z courier journeys of Euro Truck Simulator to the interplanetary, uh, roads of space. It’s out this September, and it looks wonderful.

                              <span>For me, sandbox games are never better when there’s an inherent chaos about to erupt at any given second. In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what &quot;scoundrelly&quot; means in a videogame context. Whatever it means, Han Solo homage Star Wars Outlaws ain&#x27;t it. Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment&#x27;s open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

Anno 117: Pax Romana will be the earliest period for the franchise yet, travelling back to the time of a peaceful Ancient Rome. After the biggest gap between Anno games yet, we at least won’t have to wait too long for the newly revealed entry: it’s out next year.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

                              <span>How do you like your coffee? For those who answer: &quot;served by a barista with ten arms wearing a mask adorned with intense scarlet lipstick&quot;, you are in luck. The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it&#x27;s a good souls &#x27;em up remains to be seen. I&#x27;ve only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I&#x27;ve collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game&#x27;s first café.

                              <span>I Am Your Beast is a tactical, smack-tical, I hope this tree branch doesn’t crack-tical while I’m hopping off it to land on this dude’s back-tical FPS. It’s from Strange Scaffold, of El Paso, Elsewhere and Booked For The Week fame. It is a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage that has you chaining together thrown knives and solar plexus punches, headshots and tree-fu. Lob an empty pistol at your screen, and then replace it, because you’ll need it to watch the trailer below.

                              <span>One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

It&#x27;s being developed by Sonderlust Studios, headed up by Mark Of The Ninja&#x27;s lead designer Nels Anderson, alongside other talented developers like Karla Zimonja, who worked on Gone Home. Yeah, it&#x27;s definitely one to watch.

Even the set-up is similar to the farming game. You rock up all chef-like off the train, and you&#x27;re soon greeted by your guide Hazel, yet another Boba-clutching robot. I might be misremembering Stardew. Fry yourself off a nice chunk of trai-loumi below.

It&#x27;s not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That&#x27;s about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don&#x27;t worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.

                              <span>&quot;Deus Ex but tiny and hilarious&quot; is how I pitch the first Streets of Rogue to people in elevators. Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. &quot;It&#x27;s also total chaos!&quot; I yell, as the elevator plummets. &quot;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&quot; Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It&#x27;s coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

You can’t fool me, god of game reveals, this one has been openly in the works on GameJolt for 2 years.
