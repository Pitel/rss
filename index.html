Nintendo has just released a sizeable update for its online racing game F-Zero 99, adding in private lobbies, secret tracks and much more.
Private lobbies will come with a 4-digit passcode, allowing players to use passcodes to meet in the same lobby race. The new secret tracks will &quot;occasionally appear in the game and some other changes have been made like the increase of the maximum level and skill rating.

The new &quot;open-world survival and crafting game&quot; Palworld has become insanely popular overnight, with sales surpassing the seven million mark and now supposedly overtaking first-week records of games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Of course, there&#x27;s also been a lot of debate about this game online - mostly in regards to the monster designs. While Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have refused to comment on this new global sensation, TPC&#x27;s former chief legal officer has chimed in with his thoughts, admitting he&#x27;s surprised it got this far.

                              <span>EXS to impress.
Japanese developer Frenchbread&#x27;s phenomenal anime fighter, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late, impressed the heck out of us when it dropped in its final revised form on Switch back in 2020. Nabbing a 9/10 score in our review, it quickly became one of those very special games that we just straight-up refuse to ever delete off our SD cards. Still easily one of the console&#x27;s best fighters, it&#x27;s a slick and addictive work of indie art that only missed out on a perfect score due to some very disappointing online issues. And hey, now it&#x27;s got a sequel!
Yep, UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes (herein referred to as &#x27;UNI2&#x27; because we&#x27;re down with the kids) sees you return to a world where humans ravaged by the &#x27;Hollow Night&#x27; (scary void monsters) become In-Births. In-Births gain the ability to control a power known as EXS, and that&#x27;s how...well, that&#x27;s how they fight so good. We don&#x27;t understand much more of the story in all honesty, beyond this and the fact there&#x27;s a 500-year-old girl named Linne knocking about, we&#x27;re just happy that we understand what the franchise&#x27;s crazy name is all about now.

By the time I saw the credits on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, I felt like I had been through the emotional ringer. I was mentally exhausted. I think that&#x27;s by design.

                              <span>Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. 
Reincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.
The shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.


In a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, 
Until service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. 
Former editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that &quot;Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.&quot;</span>

Both concerts were set to be a part of Nintendo Live events in December of last year and this month, too, in Tokyo, Japan, but these events were canceled over safety concerns, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Now, everyone will be able to watch these concerts when they hit the official Nintendo YouTube channel next month. 
More specifically, The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert will go live on Friday, February 9, at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, and the Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert will be posted on February 10.

That&#x27;s when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it&#x27;s when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. 
Nintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: 


For the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go &quot;way back&quot; with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina&#x27;s co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. 
With the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It&#x27;s likely Agent 8&#x27;s colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we&#x27;ll have to wait until February 22 to find out. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass.

                              <span>We all know cats have nine lives, but Umbraclaw is on the way to prove they also get successively cooler powers each time they die. The latest side-scrolling action game from Inti Creates (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Blaster Master Zero) is set to launch on consoles and PC on May 30, 2024.


Specifically, Umbraclaw is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. A demo is on the way to the February 2024 edition of Steam Next Fest, and you can see how much ass this little cat kicks in the release date trailer below. 




Umbraclaw follows a house cat named Kuon, who awakens in the Soulplane after dying in our world. In order to return home, she&#x27;ll have to brave this realm of the dead, which has a really cool art style to it. While cats do have nine lives, those lives come and go rather easily. Whenever Kuon takes a hit she dies; simple as that. Thankfully, she has an &quot;Anima Revive&quot; power that can bring her back to life with a new skill each time, paving the way for different play styles and leading her toward multiple possible endings. 


Some of those skills are animal transformation skills like the Crow, Tyrannosaurus, and Elephant (take that, Mario). Kuon can also change into a humanoid form for &quot;full fighting action,&quot; switching the focus from enemy avoidance to direct combat. Blaster Master Zero director Satoru Nishizawa is at the helm for this one, and hopefully, it&#x27;s as fun to play as it is to watch. We&#x27;ll see how the sampler pans out next month ahead of the May launch. We&#x27;ll also find out more about the other mystery game Inti Creates is working on During PAX East 2024!

                              <span>Remember Diablo 2 and its infamously stingy inventory system? Years ago, the classic RPG taught many of us how remarkably satisfying it feels when all of your loot clicks together just right. Enter Backpack Hero: a game that takes this very system and runs —nay, sprints with it.



To be clear, Backpack Hero isn’t the first attempt to make a game out of loot packing. The Save Room games, for example, turn Resident Evil 4’s inventory system into a standalone puzzler. What, Backpack Hero does, instead, is interpret this concept as a full-fledged, deckbuilding roguelite. The result is surprisingly engaging, even if some of the game’s supplementary systems don’t quite stick the landing.

                              <span>Every so often, a game comes along with an amazing elevator pitch but as soon as you jump into it, it becomes obvious why it&#x27;s a bad idea. 


We&#x27;re all capable of well-meaning bad ideas, and Rotten Flesh is one of them. It features a concept that blends genuinely terrifying cosmic horror with a gimmick that should have never made it this far. You find yourself in a strange underground sewer (at least for as long as I played) and complete typical Resident Evil-style environmental puzzles (it&#x27;s even got a typewriter to save!). Your objective? To find your dog, named Roy.


To locate the right direction to travel in (even with a lantern it&#x27;s quite dark) you need to call out for Roy who&#x27;ll bark back in response. As an experiment for how terrible of a gameplay mechanic this is, try yelling out Roy five times right now: I&#x27;ll wait! I&#x27;d do it too but I live in an apartment, and as a society, we have rules.




Raising your voice like this to your dog is annoying in real life and it gets no better when you&#x27;re dealing with a microphone on a controller or the Steam Deck or your laptop that&#x27;s actually hooked up to a monitor and sits under your desk. 


You can avoid some of these problems by pressing a button for your main character to do the yelling for you, but that takes away a key component of the game&#x27;s identity. The aim was to make a sound-inspired game. On that front, we have an amazingly unpleasant title. 


It&#x27;s also worth mentioning how tiring it is to keep yelling for Roy when you&#x27;re lost. I&#x27;d rather use any of my other main means of communication, even eye-tracking as the game Before Your Eyes does beautifully, than yell at my game. 


There&#x27;ll be some who enjoy this title and its uniqueness. I generally like idiosyncratic titles. Give me an FMV or unique indie any day. But not Rotten Flesh. He&#x27;s not a good boy.

                              <span>Yoko Taro’s NieR series has been synonymous with live service crossovers since the release of NieR Automata. Everything from Final Fantasy XIV to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has seen the likes of 2B make an appearance, so it&#x27;s tragically ironic that NieR’s own live service game, NieR Reincarnation, is closing its doors soon.


An announcement was posted to the official NieR Reincarnation website confirming that the game will officially end service on April 29, 2024. As a small consolation, NieR Reincarnation will continue to receive updates in the interim. In addition to boosting item drop rates and giving out pulls from its gacha every day, the game’s “The People and the World” story arc will see its final chapter on March 28.

                              <span>Say what you will about the likes of Resident Evil 4, its iconic B-movie cheese means it&#x27;s a game that doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously. However, there&#x27;s being flippant about certain aspects of your IP and...whatever&#x27;s going on with this mod.


If you want to see the kinds of things people do to mess about with their favorite games, look no further than Nexus Mods user SupremeLeader777. For some reason, they&#x27;ve decided to take Ada Wong from Resident Evil 4&#x27;s &quot;Separate Ways&quot; DLC and swap out her character model for that of a harbor seal.

If there&#x27;s any rationale behind it, they&#x27;re not saying so on the download page. The images suggest it&#x27;s exactly as you would imagine: RE4 Remake with a seal instead of Ada running (flapping?) around the place.


You can almost hear the slapping sounds


As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s still the same DLC content – still the same game – just you play as a slippery, Arctic mammal instead of the infamous mercenary. If you go through SupremeLeader777&#x27;s other mods, you&#x27;ll see this is not the first instance of swapping the vanilla character out for someone (or something) else. It&#x27;s the appeal of modding, I guess.


A couple of days ago, I wrote about how someone has made it possible to play RE4 in first-person without needing a headset. One might argue this is quite a nifty download for anyone who hasn&#x27;t got – and/or can&#x27;t afford – VR.


That&#x27;s not to say anything negative about the Ada Wong/seal mod. Seeing the silly things people in the community do is one of the reasons I love talking about modding. But now all I can think about is whether the harbor seal speaks in Wong&#x27;s voice, or the audio has been replaced by &quot;arfs&quot; instead.

                              <span>Excitement for Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s upcoming action-RPG Avowed has no doubt ramped up since it was shown off at Developer Direct. Since then, some extended footage has been doing the rounds, with an in-depth discussion about the game from its two directors.


In the recent video from the official Xbox podcast, Game Director Carrie Patel and Gameplay Director Gabe Paramo take us through some moments from Avowed&#x27;s Shatterskarp area. We get a pretty tasty morsel of what&#x27;s to come from Obsidian&#x27;s next release (though it needs to be said that all footage is from the alpha build currently).




The action looks pretty sweet and while the game is not intending to be Skyrim adjacent, I can&#x27;t help but see a little bit of TES5 in all that sword swinging and shield bashing. I&#x27;m here for it, essentially.


Doing what Obsidian does best


While all this high-octane, fantasy action is a key part of the gameplay, there will be plenty of people who&#x27;ll be interested in how well the story will be written (yo). Obsidian is known for crafting rich worlds with great dialogue options, something which Avowed will likely feature.


Remember, this is the same studio that brought us the narrative-rich Pentiment (a game I absolutely fell in love with when I played it). Oh, also something called Fallout: New Vegas. Maybe you&#x27;ve heard of it.


It seems Obsidian Entertainment can&#x27;t do much wrong at the minute. Whatever genre it dips its toes into, the studio often come up with something that has an equal mix of great gameplay and fantastic writing. Win-win.


On top of that, Avowed will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on launch day. We don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s releasing exactly, but it&#x27;s expected later this year.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 fans woke up to big news this morning. After initially being slated for Spring 2024, the second wave of the game&#x27;s DLC is getting a bump up. It&#x27;s now scheduled to be released toward the end of next month. 


Splatoon 3 Sider Order is now confirmed to be heading our way on February 22. It&#x27;s included as part of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass. The pass consists of the already released Inkopolis DLC and the upcoming Sider Order content. The Expansion Pass is currently listed at $24.99.




Today&#x27;s Side Order release date trailer looks like it purposely evokes a Matrix vibe. We see Agent 8 fall asleep on a train just as the screen starts to glitch. It then quickly becomes overwhelmed by falling symbols that&#x27;s quite similar to the Matrix series&#x27; green coding. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see whether the sci-fi series is alluded to any further in the upcoming DLC.


Inkopolis reintroduced the first Splatoon game&#x27;s main hub as an explorable area. There were some minor changes to the environment, but nothing radical. Side Order looks to be a much meatier piece of new content.


Side Order introduces a new location in the Spire of Order. In this single-player campaign, players will experience a challenge tower of sorts. You&#x27;ll attempt to advance through the Spire of Order&#x27;s various floors by taking on wave after wave of oncoming enemies. Nintendo says the new content is meant to be played over and over.


More single-player content for the &quot;superb&quot; Splatoon 3 is certainly something to be excited about. We&#x27;ll see how it all comes together on February 22.

                              <span>Fans of Zelda music, take note, because Nintendo is bringing The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert online. The full pre-recorded performance will be available to stream for free via Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel on February 9. 




According to the official website, viewers who tune into the concert can look forward to music selections ranging from the first Zelda to Tears of the Kingdom, all performed by a full orchestra. The video is listed as being around 30 minutes in length, and you&#x27;ll be able to catch it starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time right here.


This particular concert was originally scheduled to be performed at the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event, which was canceled due to unspecified threats. The event was planned for January 20 and 21 at Tokyo Big Sight before &quot;aggressive&quot; threats were made toward Nintendo staff and attendees. This also resulted in the postponement of national and world championships for Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Beyond the concerts, the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event was also going to serve as a showcase for the latest games from Nintendo.  


The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert isn&#x27;t the only event that just announced its rescheduled plans. The Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert was also lined up for Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO, and now it will stream via Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel on February 10. Hey, that&#x27;s two back-to-back days of Nintendo concerts on YouTube! February&#x27;s already lookin&#x27; up.

Prior to the ridiculously successful launch of Palworld, Pocketpair promised a “one year roadmap” shortly after launch. Although this is more of a vague guideline of what’s to come, it gives a lot of hope for the future of Palworld.


At the top, Pocketpair confirms it&#x27;s focusing on addressing &quot;critical issues&quot; with Palworld, prioritizing fixing those problems. This includes world date rollbacks and the loading screen persisting when trying to load into new worlds.

                              <span>Time marches forward, and with it, gaming must also keep itself relevant. A few months back, we talked about how Nintendo was ending online support for two of its now-defunct consoles. A recent update from the company has since narrowed down exactly when that&#x27;s going to be happening.


As of April 8 – at exactly 4 p.m. PDT – most online services for the 3DS and Wii U will be shut down for good. That&#x27;s according to a recent Twitter post, which leads to a customer support page that goes into more detail.




The information says the discontinuation will be for the following: New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL, New 2DS XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, Wii U Deluxe, and Wii U Basic. This will affect &quot;online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.&quot; A second tweet says it&#x27;s possible to &quot;merge your unused Nintendo eShop balance to your Nintendo Account&quot; for use on the Switch. Details about that can be found here.


A number of caveats


While the servers themselves are being turned off, Nintendo does say that players &quot;will still be able to use features and game modes that do not require online communication.&quot; It also won&#x27;t be ending the StreetPass feature for now, as that uses local communication and doesn&#x27;t require online connectivity.


For the time being, you will still be able to update and redownload purchased games, and the service shutdown won&#x27;t have an immediate impact on Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. People should still be able to download update data and redownload purchased software and DLC from the eShop. Again, that can all change in the future.


I was honestly surprised online was still supported for the Wii U and 3DS. The latter was discontinued in 2020, while the former&#x27;s lifecycle was ended back in 2017, almost seven years ago. Shows how much I have my finger on the pulse of outdated Nintendo consoles.

                              <span>The Palworld Steam and Xbox/Game Pass version debacle continues thanks to patch 0.1.1.0 that arrived on January 23. To the surprise of many, including myself, Paldium Crystals got renamed to Ancient Civilization Parts in Palworld on Xbox and PC Game Pass.


To bring anyone confused up to the present, the Steam version of Palworld differs from the version on Xbox/PC Game Pass. Those playing the latter are actually a patch or two behind, even with the latest update.


According to developer Pocketpair, the reason is due to certification requirements. The Steam users are playing, 1.2.0, is still going through Microsoft certification. Presumably, as versions are certified, players of Palworld on Xbox will soon get caught up with their Steam friends.

                              <span>Pokemon has announced that a new set of accessories are now available at the Pokemon Center. The new drop features everything you need to prove you&#x27;re a Pokemon professional. 


The new accessories feature new designs for card sleeves and playmats, including some showing off the Paldean legendaries Koraidon and Miraidon. Fans who have been there since the beginning aren&#x27;t forgotten, so you also get products with Porygon. 


For something a little more varied, grab the products featuring Garchomp, who used to be a competitive titan. There&#x27;s also a Kanto version featuring Fire, Water, and Grass throughout the generations. 


These are far from all the new designs that have been added, and you&#x27;ll have to check the rest out at the Pokemon Center. It appears Pokemon is setting the ground for new players to gain interest, as we also got the Pokemon TCG: My First Battle product to teach players the basics. 


You can look forward to more Scarlet and Violet products, including Paldean Fates which hit stores this week (26 January) as we head into 2024.

The rightsholders, who want to use comments posted to Reddit as evidence in a lawsuit against an ISP, argued that disclosing IP addresses doesn&#x27;t violate their right to anonymous speech. Reddit wholeheartedly disagrees and has asked the court to deny the request, just like it did the others.

Less than a week out from its launch in Early Access on Steam and Xbox, Palworld has proved itself to be a massive commercial success for developer Pocketpair and has dominated gaming discourse online since the weekend. Switch gamers can&#x27;t access it on Nintendo&#x27;s console, of course, but with its aesthetic parallels to Pokémon, it&#x27;s been the main talking point for many of us as we await the first Nintendo Direct of the year and the inevitable Pokémon Presents showcase at the end of February.
Palworld&#x27;s well-worn &#x27;Pokémon-with-guns&#x27; descriptor, coupled with a very successful marketing campaign — seriously, it feels like this was Promoted in our feeds for the last decade — has led to downloads in the millions and fiery debate online, with legions of fans coming to its defence from allegations of plagiarism and asset theft. These accusations suggest that Pocketpair — who has form when it comes to making games which look an awful lot like other games — may have taken its search for inspiration too far in this case, with certain Pal models that appear too close to certain Pokémon counterparts to be coincidence.

Nintendo has announced that online play for Steel Diver: Sub Wars has been permanently discontinued on the 3DS ahead of the full online shutdown on April 8th, 2024 (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Now, the service has technically been offline for a little while now after Nintendo commenced emergency maintenance on September 4th, 2023. According to an official post, however, the firm has been unable to resolve the issues and has thrown in the towel. As such, the game&#x27;s online service has effectively been discontinued.

Well, this is a surprise! Out of the blue, Nintendo has announced that the long-awaited Splatoon 3 &#x27;Side Order&#x27; DLC will be coming our way on 22nd February.
This one has been a long time coming. The single-player expansion was first announced back in last year&#x27;s February Direct, and was given a &#x27;Spring 2024&#x27; release window in the September one. Today&#x27;s surprise announcement looks like things jumped forward a little, though.

Before IO Interactive blew everyone’s socks off with the sublime World of Assassination Trilogy, Hitman: Blood Money was widely considered to be the crown jewel of the stealth franchise. In fact, many consider Blood Money to be the progenitor of World of Assassination; a game that thrives on freedom of choice, offering up a total of 14 excellent sandboxes, from a Chilean vineyard to the White House.
This re-release on Switch, dubbed Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, is a straightforward port of the original, retaining the same controls and visuals with slight tweaks to the user interface. What Feral Interactive has done, however, is take a few cues from IO’s more modern Hitman titles and introduce a few quality-of-life updates for players who might not have joined Agent 47 back in 2006.

Nintendo is back with yet another update for the slick squid shooter Splatoon 3. The latest patch brings the game up to ver. 6.1.0 and is available to download today.
The focus appears to have been on multiplayer modes and weapon rebalancing this time around, though we will also see changes made to Mincemeat Metalworks after the stage was removed from rotation earlier this week.

You know the classic saying, &quot;You wait ages for a bus, then two come at once&quot;? Well, perhaps not, but the point is that less than a full day after ZREO: Second Quest released an orchestral recording of &#x27;Midna&#x27; from &#x27;Twilight Symphony&#x27;, Nintendo itself has now announced that it will be broadcasting a special performance of The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert.
Taking place on February 9th, 2024 at 5 am PT / 8 am ET / 1pm GMT on Nintendo of America&#x27;s official YouTube channel, the pre-recorded performance will likely cover tracks from across the entire Zelda franchise (albeit with a particular focus on Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, no doubt).

Following on from 2021&#x27;s Heroes of the Night, this side-scrolling adventure game will once again see you playing as the superhero squad, setting out to thwart Luna Girl, Night Ninja and Romeo&#x27;s evil plans.

It feels like we&#x27;ve been waiting forever for Retro Studios to get Metroid Prime 4 out the door, and well technically speaking it&#x27;s been more than six years since the original announcement. One of the more recent updates was about a company recruitment drive, so what&#x27;s the latest? The Nintendo-focused YouTube channel &#x27;SuperMetalDave64&#x27; has reportedly spotted some new information online related to a new Retro Studios partnership and details about Metroid Prime 4&#x27;s playtesting.
The latest video from this channel sheds light on a new Retro &quot;production partnership&quot; with Next-Gen Dreams 3D - a &quot;triple AAA co-developer production studio for hire&quot; that has previously worked with companies like Ubisoft and TakeTwo and specialises in stylised trailers. It previously worked on a Game Awards trailer for the TakeTwo title Judas. The head of Next-Gen also has Retro Studios listed on their work profile with the date of &quot;September 2022&quot; attached.

HAL Laboratory is constantly pumping out new releases starring the pink puffball Kirby, so what&#x27;s planned in 2024? While there&#x27;s no official announcement just yet, unsurprisingly the company is looking towards the future and may already be hiring for its next big project to follow Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
As highlighted by Twisted Voxel, HAL is currently looking to fill roles for action programmer, UI programmer, graphics programmer, system programmer, sound programmer, 3D character artist, 3D animator, effects artist, UI artist, level design and planning assistant, sound designer and project manager. Phew, that&#x27;s quite a lot!

As part of this, it&#x27;s shared a special message thanking customers for their continued support and also posting an update about how users can merge their existing eShop funds with their Nintendo Account so it can be used on the Switch.

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s going to be amazing!&quot;.
Last year, the legendary Super Mario voice actor Charles Martinet retired from the role and was replaced by Kevin Afghani, who went on to voice the famous plumber in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The same talented voice actor also took on the voice of Wario in the new WarioWare game.
What about the future of other cast members, like the voice of Princess Peach? Well, in an update, it&#x27;s been confirmed Samantha Kelly will be reprising her role as the princess in Princess Peach: Showtime. This information comes from an expo clip doing the rounds on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), where a fan asks her if she&#x27;ll be voicing the princess in the upcoming game.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s entry-level Ryzen 7000 processor, the Ryzen 5 7600X, is down to $199. That&#x27;s $100 below the original launch price of the chip and the exact same price as the slightly slower but otherwise identical Ryzen 5 7600. (It&#x27;s even cheaper than Intel&#x27;s $204 Core i5 13400F, a chip that the 7600X beats convincingly in most games.) 
In the UK, it&#x27;s the 7600 that&#x27;s the better deal, at £189 versus the 7600X at £209, but both are fine value options too.

                              <span>Roots Of Yggdrasil - an inkwashed, roguelikey, card-playing, turn-based citybuilder, inspired by Norse myth - shot to the top of my wishlist after I read Katharine&#x27;s preview last week. And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn&#x27;t one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it&#x27;s a game about being on the run. 


In Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you&#x27;ll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

                              <span>Rival survival sims Palworld and the just-launched Enshrouded are now openly battling for hearts and minds on Steam, and here comes genre supremo Valheim out of the blind corner like, errrr, one of the celebrity WWE wrestlers who hasn&#x27;t turned out to be Problematic - I don&#x27;t know, maybe Zack Sabre Jr? Educate me, wrestling fans.
Valheim isn&#x27;t waving a folding chair or a small flight of stairs, mind you. It&#x27;s holding a development diary for the forthcoming Ashlands update, due sometime in the first half of 2024. The update introduces the titular Ashlands biome, a blend of graveyard and volcano level notable for the presence of burning skellingtons, some of whom emerge from glowering stone totems.

                              <span>Before Doom became the lean, mean murdermachine we know and love, Id Software had far bigger plans for their seminal satanic FPS. Ideas dropped during development include a big focus on story, four playable characters, elemental shields, demonic weapons, and more. The mod Doom Delta brings to life many such ideas from sources including an old design document and leaked alpha builds, which I think makes it fanfic? A new version of Doom Delta launched last week, offering a curious vision of the many Dooms Id didn&#x27;t make.

Case in point: over the weekend, it was discovered that humans, in addition to Pals, could also be stuffed into balls and set to work in your base camp, but now they&#x27;ve only gone and started capturing the in-game bosses, too, thanks to a surprisingly easy-to-achieve exploit involving my bestest of friends, the island police force.

                              <span>I realised several hours into my Enshrouded playthrough that I have an unspoken internal checklist for what makes a great open-world survival crafting game. Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it&#x27;s digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it&#x27;s getting crushed by the very tree you&#x27;d just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.
One paragraph in, and I&#x27;ve already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You&#x27;ll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that&#x27;s both an accolade and a reservation. Because it&#x27;s not quite there... yet.

                              <span>As much as I love looking at and admiring sandbox citybuilders like Townscaper, I am terrible at actually playing them. I get the same kind of blank canvas choice paralysis I do in games like Minecraft, or anything where there&#x27;s no real clear objective for what I&#x27;m meant to be building. I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction. I&#x27;ve been playing its gorgeous little demo this week in between Palworld sessions, and yes, more of this please, this is utterly delightful. Happily, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the final game now either, as it&#x27;s coming to Steam on March 8th.

He recently Xeeted about the studio&#x27;s upcoming projects C and D, described as &quot;next level FMV, hold onto your seats&quot;, and &quot;reinventing 3rd person horror again&quot;, respectively. The games now have heavily redacted Steam pages, and Barlow revealed a few more details on Kinda Funny Games (helpfully transcribed a bit by VGC if you can&#x27;t be arsed watching).

The monster-catching survival sim continues to set concurrent play records on Steam, and Pocketpair are presently focussed on fixing bugs. Beyond that, though, the sky appears to be the limit, as you might expect of a game that shifted a million copies in eight hours. In particular, Pocketpair seem markedly more confident about the odds of adding PvP to the game, having downplayed the idea in interviews before release.

                              <span>Some indie hits create a legion of copycats, but others, not so much. I don&#x27;t think there are too many Papers, Pleaselikes, for example - perhaps for obvious reasons given that game&#x27;s grim subject matter.

Lil&#x27; Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>Palworld, that survival game mashup, continues to grow in popularity. In the past 24 hours, its peak concurrent player count reached 1,864,421, the second highest of any game on Steam, ever. It took that spot from Counter-Strike 2 and the only game to reach higher is now PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds, aka Plunkbat, aka PUBG.

                              <span>420mm AiOs are quite rare - not many cases come with space for three 140mm fans in a row - but they&#x27;re the biggest size of consumer radiators currently available and offer unmatched cooling potential. Therefore, it may be of interest to you to learn that the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 is down to just £79 at Amazon UK, a crazy-low price for a cooler of this size and prowess.

                              <span>Dear reader, are you - like everyone else I know - keen to build a small form factor PC? If so, you&#x27;ll probably want a Mini ITX AM5 motherboard, and this one from Asus is one of the very best available: the Asus ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming WiFi. It cost £329.99 last year, but now it&#x27;s on sale from Amazon UK for just £239.99 - a £90 savings and still £30 cheaper than Asus&#x27; official web store.

                              <span>Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off &quot;about 530&quot; people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to &quot;create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future&quot;, in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The &quot;biggest impact&quot; will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot&#x27;s own intellectual properties.

                              <span>Readers with keen memories may remember that I recently self-described as being in my scented candle girlie era. I&#x27;m currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They&#x27;re just candles of lies.

                              <span>A new update for the PC Game Pass and Xbox versions of Palworld has fixed some of its many, many known issues today, but those hoping for some fixes to its online multiplayer options will sadly have to wait a little longer. Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don&#x27;t have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren&#x27;t having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some quiet time - and I certainly am, because the people upstairs are having their kitchen refitted, and the resulting powerdrill noise is literally shaking things off my desk - I recommend a stroll across the plains of Planetside 2. This might seem odd advice, given that PlanetSide 2 is a shooter in which hundreds or even thousands of players fight each other simultaneously, but the thing about planet-sized wars is that they require plenty of legroom, and the thing about crowds is that you can lose yourself within them.

                              <span>Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it&#x27;s refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word &quot;Mayan&quot; does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say &quot;the Yucatán peninsula&quot;, and sometimes &quot;the mystical land of Jukatan&quot;, which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn&#x27;t make me less sus. I&#x27;ve hedged my bets by saying &quot;Mayan-ish&quot; - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

Seeing as you voted the seminal immersive sim your seventh-favourite RPG of all time, I thought you might like to see it too. It&#x27;s very good.

                              <span>I try to be open minded, you know. What usually happens is I give an adventure game a chance though they&#x27;re all terrible (all of them), and I try. I really do. I made it several hours into Stasis Colon Bone Totem before getting frustra-bored and giving up. That may sound damning, but it&#x27;s actually very good indeed, because usually that happens within about ten minutes. I can&#x27;t say it defied my hatred of the genre as much as a The Last Express or The Cat Lady, but it had a good enough run to deserve talking about. Not least as I&#x27;m still curious about its setting.

                              <span>Ahhh, fast travel: the opinion generator. Speaking to IGN, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno threw his own hat into the ring, saying that he&#x27;s keen to avoid fast travel in DD2 and would prefer that &quot;players travel normally and experience the world around them&quot;. If you&#x27;re someone who argues all games should let you teleport to the objective, then Itsuno thinks you&#x27;re wrong. Hey, he doesn&#x27;t mess about, and I don&#x27;t disagree with him, as long as the game isn&#x27;t actually wasting my time.

                              <span>Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a brilliant foray into turn-based chaos, but some of its RPG elements didn&#x27;t quite lead anywhere. Well, in swaggers the frankly ginormous Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth to tie off the loose ends and give us a follow-up that links all the best bits of Yakuza into a far more satisfying reward loop. Some of the refinements make for superb silliness, while others are a bit eh - not everything is perfect. But spending time with Ichiban and his pals in the sun-soaked Hawaii and beyond is the real treat. It&#x27;s a wonderful, happy JRPG and it will never fail to brighten my day. Thank goodness for Yakuza.

                              <span>For such a ma-bloody-hoosive RPG, it turns out Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can fit rather snugly in the diminutive Steam Deck. Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

I&#x27;m not confident I will best the reaper in Iron Fist combat. But I cannot pass up the adrenally depraved possibility of successfully performing a ten-button airborne combo on mortality made manifest. It would be rad. It would be absurd and beautiful and I know, for a fact, that Death will play as Panda. 
But will we play Tekken 8? Or roll back to Tekken 7? Hmmm. Let&#x27;s find out.

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s Avowed is a game for the more indecisive or changeable RPG player, with no &quot;enforced&quot; classes and an emphasis on easily respeccing and experimenting with different combinations of weapons and abilities.

                              <span>astragon Entertainment and Mi&#x27;pu&#x27;mi Games have released Howl on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today. It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.


Howl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.




The announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.


There are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. 


I’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.


Howl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>Whether you simply forgot that the character was coming, or, it snuck up on you (because that&#x27;s what he does), Solid Snake makes his Fortnite debut today. 


We&#x27;ve known the character was coming since the Fortnite Chapter 5 launch trailer dropped in early December. But today, we now know exactly what the tactical espionage expert brings along with him. 




With the character&#x27;s inclusion, Fortnite will also be adding EMP Stealth Camo as a new item. It can render players nearly invisible for a brief amount of time. You can activate it as often as you like, though there is a cooldown timer you&#x27;ll have to wait through in between uses.


When the EMP Stealth Camo is disabled, an EMP pulse is discharged that will damage nearby shields and bring any vehicles in the area to a screeching halt. You…</span>

                              <span>After hoping for a release toward the end of 2023, we now know when the Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut will be landing on iOS and Mac devices. 505 Games, the team handling the port, has confirmed the title will be delivered next week. 


The release will make the definitive version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s 2019 hit available to a substantial new audience.  It&#x27;s playable for everyone with an iPhone 15 Pro or iPads and Macs with the M-series chip. It will be available for download via the Apple App Store on January 30. 




The Director&#x27;s Cut was initially released for PlayStation 5 in September 2021. It was then followed with a PC iteration in March 2022. Within it comes the base game, as well as a new underground factory location, expanded story missions, and various delivery assists to make navigating terrain a bit easier. 


505 Games is publishing the port. The Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is being listed on the App Store for $39.99. However, those who preorder ahead of the January 30 launch can enjoy a nice 50% discount on their purchase. It&#x27;s the first of potentially many future titles that Kojima has committed to bring to Apple&#x27;s platforms. 


Players who own multiple newer Apple products should be aware that the game incorporates Apple&#x27;s Special Delivery feature. This enables those with Mac and iOS devices to purchase the Director&#x27;s Cut once and have it playable across all platforms. Just be sure to have space available, as the Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut on iOS and Mac comes in at a sizeable 69.8 GB.

                              <span>The team behind 2022&#x27;s excellent movie-mystery Immortality is back with not one, but two new projects. Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid have stealthily launched Steam pages for Project C and Project D.


Both projects contain heavy redactions in their page descriptions and info, much like how Immortality was called &quot;Project Ambrosio.&quot; Barlow responded to the teasers getting spotted by accounts like Wario64, though we don&#x27;t have much more to go on now besides the pages themselves.




Project C is the new cinematic... something from Barlow and Half Mermaid, his studio that&#x27;s produced both Telling Lies and Immortality. (Barlow&#x27;s previous Her Story lists him as the sole developer and publisher.) You will appear to do something for the first time ever in a video game, for what that&#x27;s worth.


Meanwhile, Project D is a survival horror game from the Half Mermaid crew. Keywords include &quot;nurse,&quot; &quot;1983,&quot; &quot;nightmare,&quot; and &quot;be careful.&quot; Seems like something worth paying attention to for Silent Hill fans, at the least.


Life preserved in the pictures


Alongside this news, Barlow and co. also confirmed a partnership with Lost in Cult for a new Design Works book about the making of Immortality. All that, plus Immortality hitting PlayStation today, makes for a big news day for the Half Mermaid team.


It&#x27;s interesting to see the Half Mermaid crew tackle two projects, and tease them out at the same time. Immortality was an absolutely captivating game that easily stole a spot in my end-of-year favorites, so I&#x27;m keen to see what&#x27;s next for them. Both a cinematic work and a survival horror effort makes me curious, though. We really only have a few screenshots and scattered text to go on, though. It&#x27;s good fodder for all the House of Leaves fans, I guess.


We&#x27;ll learn more about Project C and D soon, hopefully. In the mean time, play Immortality if you haven&#x27;t, preferably with the lights off and sitting too close to the monitor.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner on February 29, so Square Enix is capitalizing on the thirst for more Cloud and Sephiroth with special screenings of the CG-animated Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children film a week ahead of launch. 


Originally released nearly two decades ago in 2005, the Tetsuya Nomura-directed feature is a characteristically over-the-top look at the world of Final Fantasy VII two years after the events of the original game. The film&#x27;s return to theaters is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix, Fathom Events, and Sony Pictures. It will mark the first time for the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete director&#x27;s cut version to hit cinemas.

The screenings will be in theaters for just two days. Those who want to see Cloud&#x27;s Buster Sword in the largest format possible can check out the English-dubbed version on February 21, followed by the subtitled version on February 22. The director&#x27;s cut is a whopping 26 minutes longer than the theatrical release, packing in various visual improvements and around a thousand updated scenes. The story finds a mysterious new illness spreading quickly throughout the world, bringing old enemies back out of the woodwork and forcing Cloud to pick up his impossibly heavy blade and get back into action. 


If you do decide to head to the theater for this one next month, Square Enix wants you to prepare for a history lesson before the lights dim. Folks who show up early will be treated to exclusive introductory content like the history of Final Fantasy VII, how it connects to Advent Children, interviews with Tetsuya Nomura and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, and more.

                              <span>Following some delays, Freedom Planet 2 finally made its PC debut in September 2022, and now it has its sights set on consoles. Publisher XSEED Games announced plans to bring developer GalaxyTrail&#x27;s sequel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2024.


In addition to showing off the four heroines of Freedom Planet 2 and their high-speed exploits, the release date trailer previews a brand new mode. When Freedom Planet 2 hits consoles it will come with the oft-requested Boss Rush mode across all platforms, including a simultaneous update on PC. Split into two divisions with 17 boss challenges in each one, Boss Rush mode will be accessible via the in-game Battlesphere when it goes live. Beating the bosses in both divisions will unlock an in-game VIP room full of easter eggs that long-time fans should appreciate.




XSEED has digital releases set for all platforms, with the Switch eShop release offering 10% off pre-orders from now until a week after launch. The PlayStation release will include a bundle of both the PS4 and PS5 versions, and those who opt to check it out on Xbox will be able to take advantage of Smart Delivery to access the optimal version of the game on both platforms. 


I haven&#x27;t played the sequel yet, but the first Freedom Planet was pretty much the ideal Sonic game I never knew I needed, so I&#x27;m psyched for this one to hit consoles. It all makes sense considering the series&#x27; origins as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame by GalaxyTrail founder Sabrina DiDuro. If you can&#x27;t wait until the console release, you can nab the sequel for the same price of $24.99 on Steam right now.

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting closer to Princess Peach&#x27;s next act on the main stage. Princess Peach: Showtime! is coming to the Nintendo Switch in March, and Nintendo dropped a new trailer today teasing what&#x27;s on the way.


The leader of the Mushroom Kingdom leaves the crown behind and takes on a series of new roles in the upcoming title. Many of which you can catch in the new Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer below. 




So far, we&#x27;ve seen Peach sport several different hats, including a cowgirl getup, detective &#x27;fit, swordfighter ensemble, and even a patissiere costume complete with Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie-inspired designs. 


The gist of Princess Peach: Showtime! revolves around Peach and a few of her closest toads putting on a show at the famed Sparkle Theater of the Mushroom Kingdom. However, shockingly to everyone, some bad guys arrive to heckle the performers and put an end to the show. 


Gameplay-wise, Peach will tackle a bunch of different roles as she travels from stage to stage in an effort to take down the nefarious Grape and the Sour Bunch. Yes, that is their real name.


To squash Grape and his crew, the Mushroom Kingdom Princess will take on numerous roles, including Swordfighter Peach, Patissiere Peach, Cowgirl Peach, Ninja Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, and likely several more that we haven&#x27;t seen yet. 


Princess Peach: Showtime! gives us the Princess&#x27; first solo outing since 2005&#x27;s Super Princess Peach on the Nintendo DS. It&#x27;s one of the better non-Mario Mario games out there. The character is long overdue for a new outing of her own, especially after the character&#x27;s strong depiction in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.


Peach will look to make Grape whine and go home when Princess Peach: Showtime! raises the curtains on March 22.

It isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.




Having played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.


I previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.


Pacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia&#x27;s RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.


In a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it&#x27;s a &quot;cutting-edge modding platform&quot; that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.




The above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We&#x27;re already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.


Also comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction


I suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it&#x27;s designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its &quot;level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine.&quot;


We know it works on older games because we&#x27;ve already seen it in action. The software &quot;works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines.&quot; Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.


Whether you&#x27;re sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other &quot;re-&quot; words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.

                              <span>As soon as the Internet first got its first look at juggernaut-to-be Palworld, many began accusing it of looking a lot like, well, let&#x27;s not play that game — you know what I&#x27;m talking about. 


Still, it seems as if it&#x27;s not enough to quench all that thirst for Pokémon content, as YouTuber ToastedShoes posted a video of a modded version of the game, replacing the pals with Pokémon and making the main character Ash.




Mechanics-wise, Palworld seems to remain essentially the same, but it feels like a weird new thing. It&#x27;s hard to avoid looking at Misty holding a shotgun and not think of the possibilities for a zombie apocalypse game set in the world of Pokémon.



The mod isn&#x27;t out yet for everyone, but Nintendo has shown they&#x27;re watching by immediately taking down ToastedShoes&#x27; original a…</span>

The importance of Project Zomboid&#x27;s Build 42 cannot be overstated. The last major revision of the long-lasting indie zombie simulator, Build 41, came out in December 2021. From that point onwards, the majority of Zomboid&#x27;s big and meaningful content and feature updates had been getting rolled up into Build 41. Examples include a substantial performance uplift, the addition of wildlife and animal/ husbandry, medieval-esque tools, fluid mechanics, map expansion, skyscrapers and bunkers, and loads more.

                              <span>With Phantom Liberty now done and dusted, CD Projekt Red is keen to get cracking on some new projects. With that in-mind, it seems the studio is now looking to make some headway on the new Witcher saga.


That&#x27;s according to a recent report from Reuters. The developer&#x27;s joint CEO, Adam Badowski, tells the publication that the team is aiming to start the &quot;production phase&quot; on the first entry in the next set of Witcher games, currently codenamed Polaris.




Badowski goes on to say that the company would like to &quot;have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year.&quot; CDPR is also at the &quot;conceptual phase&quot; regarding the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, with around 80 people expected to be working on that game by the end of 2024. CD Projekt Red has also apparently considered multiplayer elements for the new Cyberpunk, but isn&#x27;t discussing details right now.


Win some, lose some


On top of this, a recent post on Twitter announced that Phantom Liberty has been nominated for &quot;Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real-Time Project&quot; at the 22nd Annual Visual Effects Society Award.


The Cyberpunk DLC was not only the culmination of a lot of work fixing the glaring issues that plagued the game, but it was also something of a swansong for the dystopian RPG. CD Projekt Red may well take what harsh lessons it&#x27;s learned and apply them to the sequel.


However, the Reuters report goes on to say that the studio may be looking into artificial intelligence for some of its future releases. Michal Nowakowsk said he thinks &quot;AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production,&quot; but added that it couldn&#x27;t &quot;replace people.&quot; Make of that what you will.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio reset its flagship series with Yakuza: Like a Dragon, an aptly named title that saw newcomer Ichiban Kasuga take the lead in RPG hero fashion. With Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, RGG returns to the role-playing formula, with one foot in the future and the other in the past.


While Ichiban is back to lead, his predecessor Kazuma Kiryu returns, too. At first, the duo form a party together and then, eventually, split into two parties with each protagonist as their own leader. And while I dig a lot about what this does for the story, and the ways in which RGG Studio has clearly upgraded its blueprint from Y:LAD, it’s hard not to notice the stumbles it makes along the way.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is absolutely massive. It is a transition period for the series, mo…</span>

Due to release on February 2, Suicide Squad is also getting a suite of post-launch content, in true live-service fashion.


The very first batch of this content has only just been revealed, in fact, giving players a taste of what&#x27;s to come over the next couple of months. It should come as no surprise that much of what&#x27;s been revealed is classic live-service fare. Notably, not only was Rocksteady quite unshy about the game&#x27;s live-service leanings for some time now, but the whole thing got leaked not too long ago, adding even more fuel to the proverbial fire.

Maybe it&#x27;s a bit cliché to say it&#x27;s taking the industry by storm, but the data shows just how massive it&#x27;s been in such a short span of time.


We&#x27;ve already spoken about how the game has been smashing Steam records, but the numbers just keep going up and up. At the time of writing, not only has Palworld surpassed 1.8 million players within the last few minutes, but it&#x27;s also become the second-most-played Steam game ever, according to stats from SteamDB. This puts it ahead of Valve&#x27;s own Counter-Strike 2.




On top of that, a recent tweet from the developer says the game has now sold more than six million copies. That&#x27;s in the space of four days, remember?


Let me catch my breath, please!


I seriously can&#x27;t keep up with the figures. Between pitching this story and writing these very words, Palworld seems to keep breaking expectations. By the time this article gets published, I&#x27;m anticipating news about how it&#x27;s elevated itself above human comprehension and has taken over the very cosmos.


But how long can something like this last? It&#x27;s not even been a week, but the number of people playing has exceeded what anyone could have predicted. It&#x27;s knocked the Steam Deck off its number one spot, which is something that even the most hyped-up games struggle to do.


And the best part is, it is still in Early Access. It&#x27;s pretty bug-ridden (it&#x27;s straight up crashed my Xbox twice already, to the point where I thought it had bricked the console at one point), but there&#x27;s something about a &quot;Pokémon-with-guns&quot; game that&#x27;s got everyone talking. Surely the bubble will burst soon, yeah?

                              <span>One might say that Steam has something of a reputation when it comes to video game sales. We get quite a few of them throughout the year, and this latest one will appeal to your inner pirate (and ninja. Don&#x27;t forget the ninjas).


As of January 22, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest began, providing a host of discounts on all things related to the aforementioned buccaneer and/or stealth assassin lifestyle. The best way to get an idea of what exactly is in the sale is to open the link above, but the video below gives a quick overview of what to expect. 




You&#x27;ll find games like Sekiro, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, Pillars of Eternity II, Secret of Monkey Island, TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, and may more as part of the event. Essentially, if it&#x27;s a pirate or ninja-themed game, it&#x27;s probably here.


From laissez-faire economics to bootleggin&#x27;


Personally, I&#x27;m tempted by Monkey Island, as it&#x27;s still something I haven&#x27;t got round to playing yet. From the ninja category...well, you can&#x27;t go massively wrong with the original Shadow Warrior. Ah, 3D Realms. Whatever happened to you? Oh, yeah. You were acquired by Embracer Group.


It feels like we&#x27;ve had one Steam sale event already since 2024 began. That&#x27;s because we did. The Capitalism and Economy Fest was just a couple of weeks ago. These things tend to come around pretty quickly, I find.


Anyway, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest is ongoing until Monday, 29 January. So the standard week-long event for these types of sales. Blow me down, me hearties, etc.

                              <span>We&#x27;re not even a month through 2024 and it&#x27;s looking to be a rough year for the games industry. Massive developer and publisher Riot Games, home to League of Legends and Valorant, announced today it has laid off 530 employees or roughly 11% of its workforce. Legends of Runetterra, Riot&#x27;s competitor to Hearthstone, is also seeing a reduction in team size and will shift focus to its Path of Champions PvE game mode. Riot Forge, a division of Riot Games that focuses on teaming up with established developers and creating unique single-player experiences in the Runterra universe, will also be sunset.





Riot Forge comes to an end


Announced in 2019, Riot Forge has worked with other developers to release five single-player games over the last four years, with a sixth game, Bandle Tale, set to …</span>

                              <span>One of my oldest memories is of a time when my sister wouldn’t let my Ghostbusters action figures bust ghosts in her Barbie doll house. The exclusion was my only major exposure to the toy.


I did watch the hit 2023 movie, which I enjoyed. I think it was a fun idea to focus on the generational impacts the toy had on women rather than try to contrive some sort of hero’s journey out of it. Wait… it was a hero’s journey! That structure shows up in the strangest places.


Anyway, that’s not the reason I bought 1993’s Barbie Super Model. I did it because I’m still recovering from one of the worst games I’ve ever played. I need some comforting shovelware. Gosh, did I get it.

                              <span>Half Mermaid, led by Sam Barlow, is known for making video games using FMV, and they often require the player to sort through footage to solve mysteries. But for the studio&#x27;s next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid&#x27;s developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called &quot;Project C&quot; and &quot;Project D,&quot; have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here&#x27;s a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

Dubbed Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, this expanded version of the 2005 CG film is 26 minutes longer than the original. Square Enix states it features “roughly a thousand revised scenes with expanded themes and improved visuals.” 
Before the film starts, though, fans who arrive early will witness exclusive introductory content, such as a history of Final Fantasy VII presentation that explains its ties to Advent Children. Gameplay footag…</span>

                              <span>Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

Fittingly, these new Joy-Con are pastel pink, just like Peach&#x27;s signature dress. They will be available for purchase at select retailers and Nintendo&#x27;s online store for a limited time, although Nintendo did not mention exactly when players can buy them. 
And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach. 
Check them out for yourself in the new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer below:

The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos. Although Tekken 8’s fighting remains a treat thanks to some neat tweaks to its strong formula, the rest of the package, while respectable, falls short of some of its contemporaries.

                              <span>X Corp refuses to comply with a DMCA subpoena targeting X/Twitter users who allegedly leaked unreleased Genshin Impact content online. Publisher Cognosphere obtained the subpoena last November and views this is a straightforward matter. X Corp believes that the lack of judicial oversight built into the DMCA subpoena process poses a risk to the First Amendment rights of its users.

                              <span>Full steam ahead!
We believe it quite impossible to be a shoot-&#x27;em-up lover and not have stumbled upon HOT-B’s cult classic Steel Empire, the 1992 Mega Drive-exclusive horizontal shmup that mesmerised players with incredible steampunk aesthetics, an epic soundtrack, and a stiff challenge. Far from forgotten, there have been in the past two re-releases/remasters of the game on console, one on Game Boy Advance back in 2005 and 3DS in 2014. Is this third HD revisit — based on the 2018 PC release — worth its price in coal or is it just a load of hot air? Strap in to find out.
The action takes place in a familiar yet bizarre post-industrial revolution civilisation during a great war waged between the nations of the Republic of Silverhead and the Motorhead Empire (no smirking in the back, now). In this alternate 19th century, the steam engine has become the world’s greatest invention causing military machine design to evolve into gigantic monsters of steel and fire that rule the land, the sea. and the skies. You take the role of a nameless Silverhead republican pilot onboard the aircraft carrier Rheinhalt. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the technology of Silverhead is more advanced than their opponent, evident through your choice of aircraft and the mighty &#x27;Imamio Thunder&#x27; bomb devices that can cause devastating damage to the steel-dependent Motorhead military units.

My Time at Sandrock wasn&#x27;t in the best state when it launched on Switch last November. With few &#x27;new&#x27; features and a rough performance, developer Pathea Games had a lot of work to do to make sure that there was a brighter future ahead. We recently spoke exclusively to the team about their update plans and the road ahead, and today sees the launch of the massive ver. 1.1.4 update we discussed.
Shared on the official r/MyTimeAtSandrock subreddit, the latest update sets out to fix just about every issue that you could think of including improving pop-in and frame rate problems, and adds in all of the content from the full PC release with all the PC hotfixes until 10th December thrown in too.

Remember the range of pastel-coloured Joy-Con controllers that released last summer? It sure would have been cool to get one of those adorable pink ones for the right controller, wouldn&#x27;t it? Ponder these questions no longer! Nintendo has today revealed a new set of pastel pink Switch Joy-Con controllers which will be coming our way on 22nd March.
The new set will launch alongside Princess Peach: Showtime! (naturally) and will cost $79.99 (or your regional equivalent).

Nintendo has revealed a brand-new trailer for the upcoming Princess Peach: Showtime! on Nintendo Switch, launching on March 22nd, 2024.

He has an important bet to place at the goblinball arena so, naturally, he asks his 12-year-old daughter, Lil, to cover his shift at the guard shed.

I&#x27;m talking about a full set of 104 double-shot PBT pudding keycaps from HyperX, which combine the excellent legibility of a black backlit keycap tops with frosted semi-transparent sides. This is the perfect pairing for RGB wave fanatics, but it looks just as nice with a tastefully chosen single-colour or other effects. I am a huge fan of these keycaps, and at $12 they&#x27;re an almost essential purchase for mechanical keyboard owners.

                              <span>Double-wide 32:9 gaming monitors are becoming increasingly affordable, which is brilliant for anyone that prefers an ultra-wide aspect ratio but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with the relatively limited desktop real estate of your standard 21:9 ultrawide. 
Right now you can pick up LG&#x27;s 45-inch 45GR65DC, which essentially combines two 24-inch 1440p 200Hz screens into a single titanic panel, for just $550 - rather than the usual $700. That $150 discount turns this into a great alternative to a traditional two monitor setup, letting you have tons of space for getting work done as well as a super-immersive ultrawide gaming experience - just lovely.

Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures &#x27;remastered&#x27; by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn&#x27;t have mod support. I&#x27;ll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

                              <span>Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-collecting survival game Palworld has rekindled the eternal debate over what exactly constitutes a breach of copyright. While the game&#x27;s mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks&#x27; Pokémon games. 
The developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.

                              <span>The next Cyberpunk game from CD Projekt - currently codenamed &quot;Orion&quot; - might have multiplayer in it, according to co-CEO Michal Nowakowski. Please let it be some kind of deckhead &#x27;passenger-seat-driver&#x27; mode, where you get to play a crusty celeb uploaded to another character&#x27;s brain implants, who strolls around the landscape as a hologram, offering passive-aggressive commentary. Watch those corners, samurai! Hey, you missed an ammo pack. SAMURAI ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME.
It&#x27;ll be a while till we find out for sure: Orion is still in the conceptual phase, with CD Projekt expecting to have about 80 people working on it by the end of this year. The higher priority in 2024, it seems, is the next big steaming helping of The Witcher.

                              <span>For a series that&#x27;s defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom&#x27;s beloved lawyer &#x27;em up. Except poor old Apollo isn&#x27;t really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still the series&#x27; original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo&#x27;s debut game rolls its credits. What&#x27;s more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom&#x27;s first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series&#x27; best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye was caught by dozens upon dozens of spam accounts hijacking the tag to promote cryptocurrency garbage. Twitter&#x27;s journey to uselessness continues. But after reporting dozens of accounts in the vain hope that Twitter might at least knock these particular bots offline (knowing it&#x27;ll never actually address the wider problem), I was delighted to admire a great many attractive and interesting indie games. Check out this week&#x27;s pick!

                              <span>“Most of videogame history is alive and well due to the ability to pirate old video games,” Frank Cifaldi, founder of the Video Game History Foundation, tells me over a call. Last year, the preservation and archival non-profit put out a study revealing that 87% of games made before 2010 are out of print. “There&#x27;s no way to access them without either pirating them or buying antiques from vendors. That&#x27;s a scary place to be.”

                              <span>When Edwin popped the reveal trailer for new Metroidvania Deviator into The Maw this morning, he really wasn&#x27;t kidding about it looking a heck of a lot like Hollow Knight. You&#x27;ve got a small, diminutive hero with a nasty little blade up his sleeve, a haunting and melancholy piano score, a beautiful hand-drawn animation style, and lots of mean-looking creatures to fight. Then again, the trailer also makes it clear there are lots and lots of spikes and traps to navigate here, which puts me more in the mind of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Either way, I&#x27;m well up for another platforming-Metroidy hybrid, and developers Gami Studio have announced that there&#x27;s Steam demo coming in February.

                              <span>When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it&#x27;s among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it&#x27;s doing almost twice the numbers of Steam&#x27;s usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo&#x27;s monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck beta client update is out, and it’s made a pretty neat addition to the quick-access performance menu. A tap of the Y button now brings up a brief explainer for whichever individual setting is currently highlighted, a handy lil’ reference for anyone who wants to customise how their Deck (or Steam Deck OLED) runs without knowing exactly how things like TDP limits and half-rate shading affect performance. Clearly it’s also a brutal attack on the livelihoods of honest hardware editors who write guides to this sort of thing, but whatever, Valve.

                              <span>Developer Rocksteady Studios has pulled back the curtains on the free seasonal content coming to Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League after the game&#x27;s launch on February 2. Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he&#x27;ll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He&#x27;s second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there&#x27;s not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo&#x27;s courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.
The collection includes three games: Apollo …</span>

                              <span>Last week, the internet began to speculate that Gothic and Elex II developer Piranha Bytes was being shut down after fans noticed the studio&#x27;s website was essentially defunct. Many speculated Piranha Bytes was another casualty in owner Embracer Group&#x27;s purge of studios that began last year after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.


Studio closures at the hands of Embracer include Saints Row developer Volition Games and reformed TeamSplitters team Free Radical Design. Game Informer reached out to Piranha Bytes following last week&#x27;s speculation to see if it was, indeed, another closure at the hands of Embracer, and today, studio CEO Michael Rüve responded, stating the studio&#x27;s situation right now is difficult but that people shouldn&#x27;t w…</span>

Meanwhile, there are plenty of piracy growth regions too.

There&#x27;s a slight snag though: New Game+ mode, a staple of both the genre and the series, is this time locked away within the more expensive Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.

                              <span>After saying last weekend that I was aching for the cruelty of snow, I found it. When weather warnings popped up this week, I tracked forecasts and cloud movements for hours before booking a day off work to chase potential snow. When I woke up, it looked bad. Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really. It was so cold that snow settled on my shoulders and my hair froze. Perfect. That&#x27;s what I craved. Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>If you&#x27;re working on computers, sooner or later you&#x27;re going to have to face the facts and pick up a screwdriver set. Sure, that old Phillips screwdriver your dad gave you does the job most of the time, but wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to put it somewhere safe and get something a little more adaptable? 
Walmart are doing a good deal on a Hyper Tough 77-piece screwdriver set, which is $10 versus its regular $16 - a good deal for a set that includes everything you&#x27;d need for PC building and maintenance and has attracted a 4.5/5.0 star average after 245 reviews.

Today I&#x27;m back with a confusingly similar deal: an all-time low price on the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280, a 280mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon UK. It&#x27;s down to £70 following a 26% reduction, a great price for an AiO that regularly beats less powerful 360mm alternatives.

One look at how things are outside and I am ready to make plans to move to warmer climates (despite being from the east coast, I can’t tolerate anything under 35 degrees). But in light of…

During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s rumored N64 version, Zack&#x27;s importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game&#x27;s subtitle. My money is on &quot;Reloaded.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>After years of excitement and skeptism, the Pokémon-like survival game Palworld is now available in early access. The game drops player into a collection of tropical islands inhabited by monsters called Pals that you can catch as your own. Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It&#x27;s a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.
Watch Marcus Stewart and Alex Van Aken dive into the Xbox version of Palworld from the beginning to see how the game performs in its first incarnation. For more on Palworld, check out our recent feature in which we spoke to developer Pocketpair about the studios&#x27; origins and Palworld&#x27;s creation and features.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. 
Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn&#x27;t make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too.

                              <span>Last Epoch is gunning for the action-RPG crown long held by Diablo (and recently contested by the likes of Path of Exile and Grim Dawn). With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

There’ll also be a new area showcased with some shiny new visual tech, that you’ll be able to explore by transforming into a flying fish.

                              <span>For a game that&#x27;s been repeatedly described as &quot;Pokémon with machineguns&quot;, the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn&#x27;t already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you&#x27;ll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak&#x27;s catch &#x27;em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can&#x27;t-believe-Nintendo&#x27;s-lawyers-haven&#x27;t-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that&#x27;s not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it&#x27;s a Pokémon game on PC you&#x27;re after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

                              <span>Palworld was obviously destined for success the moment a million games journalists and Twitter users wrote “Pokémon with machine guns”. (Acceptable alternate nicknames include “Eevees with uzis” and “Abras who’ll stab-ya”.) Having finally launched into Early Access on Steam and Game Pass this week, that prophecy has rung true as the monster-catching survival game has caught (ha, ha) so many players that its servers are struggling to handle the load.

                              <span>It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don&#x27;t know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it&#x27;s the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I&#x27;ve been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it&#x27;s trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club&#x27;s dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

It&#x27;s set to release in Q2 of this year, and there&#x27;s a demo on Steam right now if you&#x27;d like to give it a try. Expect to make nice fortresses out of Lego-style bricks, then defend them from hordes of horrors. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a recipe for a good time.

                              <span>A &quot;third-person cyberpunk fighting MOBA&quot;. A villainous esports team owner. A horde of teenagers Naruto-running through a convention centre. Even as a keen viewer of Leverage: Redemption, I was leery of the heist-o-rama tackling esports. And sure, its fake video game is baffling, but I was surprised by how many notes the esports episode hit right. With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it&#x27;ll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

                              <span>I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I&#x27;ve since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it&#x27;s grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it&#x27;s an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

                              <span>The phrase &quot;best foot forwards&quot; implies the second foot will never be as good as the first, and that&#x27;s unfortunately the case with Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned For Danger. It has a 10/10 pun name and introduces/strengthens concepts that I expect will become series mainstays as we continue with this project, but this is definitely in &quot;difficult second album&quot; territory. I don&#x27;t hate it! But it&#x27;s no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that&#x27;s in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced what&#x27;s coming up in Season 3 of Diablo 4, and underneath the mountain&#x27;s worth of lore and loot updates, there was the surprisingly good news that WASD key controls were finally being added to help provide even more accurate and precise movement in the game over the series&#x27; traditional mouse clicks. Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night&#x27;s Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of &quot;was-dee&quot;, &quot;wased&quot; and &quot;double-you-ey-es-dee&quot; all over the shop as they debated this clearly very &quot;controversial topic&quot; live on air. Read on for more details about what they&#x27;re hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let&#x27;s get a poll up asap.

Enter yet more studio layoffs. 2023&#x27;s trend continues with Dead By Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive getting rid of about 45 staff, per Kotaku, while CI Games has laid off 10% of its workforce, including from Lords Of The Fallen studio Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior studio Underdog (via GI.Biz).

                              <span>Back in the depths of 2023&#x27;s February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I&#x27;d like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I&#x27;m very happy to report that it&#x27;s come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I&#x27;ve been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

                              <span>If you want to change your Destiny 2 wizard&#x27;s appearance, the only current method is to stash your wizard&#x27;s gear in your vault, create a whole new wizard with a new look (after deleting the old to free a character slot, if needed), grab your old wizard&#x27;s gear, then optionally replay any story bits to catch up. The MMOFPS has no barber, no surgeon, it&#x27;s new character or nothing. After six years (longer, if you count the first game), Bungie are finally planning to change this. An upcoming update will introduce the ability to change your character&#x27;s look—within limits. For drastic changes, you would still need a new wizard.

                              <span>I think we&#x27;re well into &quot;milking the gimmick&quot; territory for bodycam horror games now - last week&#x27;s Digested may have been one giant snake too many - but Zoochosis does have the additional virtue of being heavily inspired by the cute doggy scene from The Thing. And also, perhaps, Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s.
In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren&#x27;t supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren&#x27;t supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

We don&#x27;t have a Nate this week, but James has been playing Apelegs again and offers a surprising self-assessment of how he feels like he&#x27;s past his Apex Legends prime, and how confidence is a really necessary skill in competitive shooters. Worth tuning in for a listen to that.

                              <span>It’s been two whole graphics card generations since Nvidia last tried the whole Super-branded refresh thing, and from what I recall of that sweaty 2019 summer, most of the updated RTX 20 series cards were meek rejigs of GPUs that didn’t really need replacing in the first place. Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

                              <span>Four months after the troubled launch of Payday 3, developers Starbreeze have announced they&#x27;ve formed a &quot;strike team of veteran developers&quot; with the goal of bringing it &quot;up to where it will meet your expectations&quot;. The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you&#x27;re online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they&#x27;d just bought for £35.

                              <span>Your favourite beaver-based colony sim Timberborn&#x27;s latest big update has arrived, and honestly, I&#x27;d say your poor beavers won&#x27;t appreciate it one bit. The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn&#x27;t only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

                              <span>As we all know, I like vampire stories, and I like different takes on vampire stories. Yesterday Edwin dangled an upcoming visual novel called Vampire Therapist in front of my nose. I am intrigued, also because I appreciate a Ronseal approach to titles. In Vampire Therapist, out on Steam this June 17th, you play Sam, a vampire who becomes a therapist to other vampires. So the title works twice!

                              <span>Readers may remember how much I liked Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, principally because of how funny it was. It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it&#x27;s not quite as funny or as focused, but it&#x27;s also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

FatShark have detailed the closed alpha for Warhammer: Vermintide 2&#x27;s long-awaited Versus mode, in which the doughty Ubersreik Five go up against four player-controlled Skaven Pactsworn (translation: ratty supervillains) in addition to the rank-and-file AI-controlled rodent hordes. The alpha will launch in the &quot;near future&quot;, and sounds like just the dollop of rancid PvP shenanigans this lapsed Elven ranger needs to re-install one of the all-time great Warhammer adaptations, which unaccountably isn&#x27;t on our list of the best co-op games or the best multiplayer games on PC. You got something against horrible giant rats, Ed Thorn?

                              <span>Puzzle game classic Threes is getting a Steam PC launch to celebrate its 10th anniversary, developer Asher Vollmer has announced. The release date is 6th February, and here&#x27;s the Steam page. The new version adds controller and Steam cloud support together with achievements and leaderboards. Given its mobile origins, it should scrub up nicely on Steam Deck.

                              <span>The Cooler Master NR200 is a brilliant small form factor PC case - and now it&#x27;s heavily discounted at Amazon UK. This is a Mini ITX case which allows 360-degree access to the components therein, with space for a 240mm AiO or 155mm high air cooler, triple-slot graphics cards up to 330mm in length and seven fans in total. It&#x27;s often as high as £94, but for a little while now it&#x27;s been available for £70 - a great price that makes it well worth recommending to you, dear RPS reader.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Core i3 12100F is a surprisingly viable gaming CPU, with four Golden Cove P-cores and eight threads with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, all for under £100. Don&#x27;t be put off by &#x27;Core i3&#x27; either - this model is similar in speed to the last-gen Core i5 11600K and not too far behind the Core i7 10700K, such is the leap forward Intel made with its 12th-gen CPU architecture. Today this processor is even cheaper than normal too, with prices dropping to £88 at Ebuyer in the UK.

                              <span>Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates&#x27; response is simple: churn out more.

                              <span>The revival of this long-dormant franchise moves into the gear-and-power-gated family of games colloquially termed Metroidvanias, thanks to its similarity to early classics like Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …</span>

                              <span>Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

We also learned that it’s launching later this year. EW.com also confirmed that though Harrison Ford&#x27;s likeness will appear in the game, he will be performed by Troy Baker (The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite).
The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery. 
Like Machine Games’ modern Wolfenstein games, The Great Circle is a first-person experience. Expect to engage in shootouts and fist fights in…</span>

                              <span>Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its &quot;living world,&quot; a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players&#x27; decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara&#x27;s Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents&#x27;. The game&#x27;s score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today&#x27;s live stream, is building &quot;Triumphs,&quot; or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016&#x27;s Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its &quot;Insider Program&quot; after release, implementing player feedback.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise&#x27;s history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix&#x27;s excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana&#x27;s combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it&#x27;s due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

                              <span>Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge&#x27;s Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to &quot;craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.&quot; We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.</span>

                              <span>Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…</span>

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

The publication says its sources pointed to laid-off staff posting about the job cuts on LinkedIn, but has since received confirmation from CI Games.
It&#x27;s currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio.

However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio.

It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005&#x27;s Trace Memory for DS, and 2009&#x27;s Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.

                              <span>Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you&#x27;ll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game&#x27;s world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game&#x27;s App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.</span>

                              <span>Na konci minulého týdne jsme psali o tom, že Linus Torvalds je kvůli zimní bouři odříznut od internetu a přestal tedy pracovat na vývoji jádra. Linus průběžně informoval na Mastodonu o zlepšující se situaci, podle poslední zprávy se začalo oteplovat a dodavatel elektřiny slibuje brzké obnovení dodávek. Lidé prý už začínají vyjíždět auty ven, což podle všeho ještě není úplně bezpečné. Nemám zájem účastnit se tohoto konkrétního kontaktního sportu, a proto stále nevycházím z domu, i když obavy ze zamrzlých trubek pomalu mizí, píše Linus.</span>

Today, however, the studio announced the end of Rock Band 4 downloadable content.
The news comes more than two years after Harmonix was acquired by Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer Epic Games. Epic has since leveraged the studio&#x27;s expertise for a side game within Fortnite called Fortnite Festival, which utilizes gameplay similar to the Rock Band.

PTW was previously called Pole To Win and its services include quality assurance, studio support, and localization. Last week, on January 11, someone with knowledge of the studio told Kotaku about the layoffs, noting that roughly 45 people lost their jobs. 
The person with the knowledge of PTW also told the publication that the majority of those laid off live outside the United States – it has studios in North America, Europe, and Asia – and were QA workers. However, jobs were cut in other departments, too, Kotaku notes.

                              <span>Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game&#x27;s teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.</span>

Junes Lokka&#x27;s defense centered on his right to freely use copyrighted content for parody. Finding Lokka guilty of criminal copyright infringement for distributing the modified video on Twitter, the court found that derogatory racist content enjoys no fair use-style freedom.

                              <span>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been reading Ubisoft director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay&#x27;s thoughts from yesterday about how players need to &quot;get comfortable&quot; with renting their games as a package, rather than &quot;having and owning&quot; an individual copy. His broad takeaway is: that ain&#x27;t it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not&quot;. He feels that &quot;direct from developer to players is the way&quot;. As such you shouldn&#x27;t expect Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that Planescape: Torment&#x27;s Litany Of Curses is better than Half-Life&#x27;s Snarks. I hadn&#x27;t that expected that snark-off to be so one-sided but Morte&#x27;s cussing taunt took 80% of the votes. You have to forgive Snarks for snapping at your finger one day, Gordon, they&#x27;re just little critters. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between nostalgia and new styles, ya? What&#x27;s better: playing on an old patch, or asymmetrical outfits?

                              <span>When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don&#x27;t think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games&#x27; associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge&#x27;s creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what&#x27;s happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends&#x27; tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don&#x27;t let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours&#x27; worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life&#x27;s problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world&#x27;s portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there&#x27;s just as much to dig into here, so here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

                              <span>Take the little boy with lancing white eyes from Playdead&#x27;s Limbo, ruthlessly clone him a few dozen times (an extremely Playdead thing to do) and herd all the clones into a world redolent of Klei&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Starve, and you have something like The Tribe Must Survive. Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it&#x27;s a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the &quot;Lovecraftian Stone Age&quot;, with flagrant disregard for my nerves. Does the Lovecraftian Stone Age feature any actual walking trees? We&#x27;ll find out on February 22nd, when the game launches into early access.

                              <span>I enjoy Games Done Quick, an organisation that raises money for charity (this year is the Prevent Cancer Foundation) by playing games at peak efficiency. If you&#x27;ve never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you&#x27;ve never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year&#x27;s stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, &quot;playing&quot; a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

Plaintiffs Star India, Hotstar and Disney+ Hotstar, initially requested ISP blocking against less than 10 websites. However, since the court issued a dynamic+ injunction, they were free to keep adding domains, JW Player&#x27;s included. Instructions to unblock JW Player&#x27;s domain were not issued until January 9, 2024

                              <span>Developer Embark Studios surprise-launched its free-to-play FPS, The Finals, back in December – Game Informer documented everything that goes into a stealth release like this – and the game has continued to garner a strong fanbase. Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an &quot;experimental&quot; one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 &quot;Cash wins&quot; takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 &quot;comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play&quot; and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot; Its announcement coincides with 2024&#x27;s first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
&quot;Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis,&quot; a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is &quot;to come.&quot; 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that &quot;25&quot; is in the title, it&#x27;s likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two&#x27;s work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar&#x27;s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy&#x27;s new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized &quot;R,&quot; claiming it&#x27;s too similar to Rockstar&#x27;s own &quot;R&quot; logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the &quot;opponent&quot; in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake, which is a single game, has &quot;progressed into a production readiness stage.&quot;
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

                              <span>Diablo IV’s third seasonal event, Season of the Construct, has been revealed and kicks off next week. This time, players will journey beneath Kehjistan to battle demonically corrupted machines.
The story centers on the demon Malphas getting his hands on an ancient device called The Loom. Created by Zoltun Kulle for benevolent purposes, it’s able to create mechanical constructs, but Malphas has warped the Loom for his own sinister intentions to unleash a plague of evil machines. However, you’ve got your own trick up your sleeves.
Namely, Season of the Construct pairs players with their own mechanized companion called a Seneschal. In addition to lending a hand in combat, tanking incoming attacks, and healing players, the Seneschal serves as the primary power gain system for this season. It f…</span>

                              <span>The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.</span>

                              <span>Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the &quot;final release date,&quot; indicating GSC Game World is confident it won&#x27;t be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today&#x27;s delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine&#x27;s capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir &quot;Fresh&quot; Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we&#x27;ve been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

Jordon Longbottom faced a private criminal prosecution brought by the Federation Against Copyright Theft but avoided a custodial sentence after the case failed to be brought in a timely fashion. Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

                              <span>A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn&#x27;t have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn&#x27;t do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game&#x27;s logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
