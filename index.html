The new enemy is a hulking mechanical robot with a giant spotlight for a face. It will slowly walk around hunting players, but once it finds them will immediately enter combat mode. Here&#x27;s how to deal with fighting the Robot in Lethal Company and where you can find them.





How to Kill the Robot in Lethal Company


Unfortunately, the Robot seems to be a little overturned right now. The Robot will slowly walk around step-by-step when in its passive state. But as soon as it notices you and enters its aggressive state, will hunker down and start spamming rockets at you. If you get close enough, it will also start engulfing you in flames with its flamethrower.


At the moment, the rocket sp…</span>

This is one of the two new enemies in this update and features a pretty goofy-looking but typical Lethal Company character who can be annoying to deal with but also drops a useable Butcher Knife weapon on defeat. Here&#x27;s the best strategy to deal with the Butler as well as where you can find the new enemy.

Best strategy for dealing with the Butler


The Butler enemy in Lethal Company has both a passive and an aggravated state. It&#x27;s easy to tell the difference between the two, as while in his passive state, the Butler will simply sweep his broom across the floor as he walks around. However, once the Butler gets close enough to you he will enter his aggravated state and pull…</span>

In typical Zeekerss fashion, it can be a bit tricky finding out how exactly you are supposed to get to these moons, or at least learning their names. This is all of the Lethal Company new Moons added in the v50 update.


All three new moons in Lethal Company update 50


In total three moons have been added to the Lethal Company Version 50 update. One moon is publicly available via the terminal from the start, while the other two are secret moons. Here are all the new moons added in Lethal Company v50:

                              <span>After just over three months, the newest content update to Lethal Company, version 50, is now available. However, it&#x27;s not on the live version of the horror game but rather must be accessed through the Steam beta branch. If you&#x27;ve never done it before, it can be tricky. Here is how to access the Lethal Company v50 Beta update as well as how to revert back when you want to return to the live version.


How to enable Lethal Company Update version 50


In order to actually play the Lethal Company version 50 update before it goes live, you will need to enable the beta branch on Steam. Here&#x27;s how to enable the beta branch:



Right-click Lethal Company on Steam from your Library tab.


Left-click on Properties.


Left-click on Betas.


Under Beta Participation, click the dropdown box and choose “public_beta”.


Steam will now download the new beta files and update which overlaps your existing game files.


Launch Lethal Company from your Steam Library.



Keep in mind you will have to be on the same version as friends to play with them. So if you are on the v50 beta branch and want to play with them, they will also have to be on the beta branch.


If you want to stop playing on the beta branch and return to version 49 of Lethal Company, just follow the same process except under Beta Participation choose &quot;None&quot; instead of &quot;public_beta&quot; and it will overwrite your game files to be on the live version.


Furthermore, once the version 50 update finally goes live instead of only being on the beta branch, you will have to return your beta status to none. This will always return your version of the game to the current live version, regardless of which update version is currently the live one.

Lethal Company Update Version 50 Details


Unfortunately, Zeekerss has not yet provided official patch notes for Lethal Company v50, most likely due to the update releasing on Easter. However, we&#x27;ve jumped into the horror game to find all the details for you.

With internal developer resources having shifted almost 100% to the upcoming (yet still unannounced) &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;, Nintendo&#x27;s flagship game for the 2024 Holiday period will see a return to a less-than-fan-favourite party game series for a first-second-third outing.

                              <span>Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it&#x27;s hot — enjoy!

                              <span>While playing Stardew Valley, you might occasionally see a pop-up notification on your screen. With the 1.6 update, we saw the addition of the “you have new ideas to sleep on” notification, but there’s another that’s been around for longer - &quot;a train is passing through.&quot;


This notification can happen on any day between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm. It’s always worth running up to the railroad because the train can often drop resources. 


The trains of Stardew Valley


Various types of trains can pass through, and sadly, not all of them contain or drop resources. The most common type of train contains a variety of car types, such as passenger cars, resource cars, and even some cars with graffiti on them. 


Other types of trains include:

Of course, after taking a moment to think it through, it’s already April Fool’s Day in Japan. 


Getting ahead of the rest of the world, Pocketpair took to Discord and social media to share the following video that you’re either going to want to see come to fruition or will make you feel dirty in 100 different ways, and none of them good.




Possibly the worst part about this entire video is the fact that they start the whole thing off with a teaser about what’s inside the World Tree, only for it to be a school filled with &quot;cute Pals.&quot; Fans are desperate to know what’s special about that huge tree, but this …</span>

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is seemingly a superb game, when it&#x27;s not buggy or surprising its players with microtransactions. 

CD Projekt Red are no stranger to releasing buggy games, but they&#x27;re less keen on microtransactions - at least for singleplayer games.

                              <span>The Oculus Quest launched back in 2019, just five years ago, but come May new apps released in the Quest Store won&#x27;t be playable on the Quest 1. This isn&#x27;t because the Quest 1 isn&#x27;t powerful enough to play them anymore, but because developers will no longer be able to upload them and players won&#x27;t be able to see them.

                              <span>In the new Path of Exile 3.24 Necropolis league there is a brand new crafting mechanic involving the Undertaker and his Necropolis. You unlock this new mechanic after reaching Lioneye&#x27;s Watch but aren&#x27;t exactly told how to return to the Necropolis afterward. Here is how to get to the Necropolis in PoE 3.24.





How to return to the Necropolis and Undertaker


There are actually two ways to return to the Necropolis in Path of Exile 3.24. Here is how to get to the Necropolis once it is unlocked:



Kill a haunted monster that drops its corpse. After picking up the corpse, the Undertaker will appear. Talk to the Undertaker and he will have the option to Travel to the Necropolis.


Go to any Waypoint, either in a campaign act or in your hideout. On the right side of the World Map interface, there is a new button to Travel to the Necropolis.



For both options, the only requirement to unlock travel is encountering the Undertaker which you can do from the beginning. He will give you a quest and the Lantern of Arimor which unlocks the Morgue and the Necropolis.





How to access the Morgue


Even though the Morgue doesn&#x27;t have an actual location you can visit, you&#x27;ll still want to access it from time to time. The Morgue in Necropolis is essentially a storage space. As you kill haunted enemies and acquire their corpses, they will automatically be transferred to the Morgue after you collect them.


Here is how to access the Morgue:



Like the Necropolis, after picking up a corpse the Undertaker will appear and give you the option to View Necropolis Morgue.


When you are at the Necropolis, you can speak with the Undertaker and choose the option to View Necropolis Morgue.



The Morgue allows you to move around, delete, and put corpses into a casket so you can then resell them.

                              <span>The expression “kids these days...” never fails to precede a superior display of generational and cultural disconnect. I’m trying to inoculate myself against one day getting the urge to say that by getting dangerously exposed to the thing that’s currently taking the youths by storm. That thing, right now, is Skibidi Toilet. 


Skibidi Toilet is a bizarre YouTube series that combines Half-Life 2 character models with toilets to tell a bonkers story. If it helps, you can think of it as an attempt at making the new generation’s Space Ghost Coast to Coast, or the G.I. JOE PSAs by someone who likely doesn’t even know those exist. 


YouTube HL2 spoofs aren’t new, but the thing about Skibidi Toilet is how huge of a phenomenon it has become, and how it still managed to fly under the mainstream ra…</span>

With update 1.6, we gained more cat and dog varieties, and even some turtles, to bring home with us from Marnie’s. 


However, there is a particular type of pet that is eluding the playerbase - purple cats and dogs. 


If you follow Stardew Valley in any capacity, you’d be hard-pressed to avoid the discussion of these purple pets on YouTube, TikTok, Reddit and Twitter. Talk of these mauve moggies and plum pooches is seemingly everywhere, but every video or comment ends in the same way - how are we supposed to get them?

I&#x27;ve seen a few stories over the years about tributes developers have made to dedicated fans of their games. Be it the Robin Williams tribute in World of Warcraft or the time Bungie gave a weapon to a Destiny 2 player who had overcome tremendous adversity that no one else has gotten to this day. It&#x27;s always heartwarming to see a developer notice how important a game is to its fans, but it&#x27;s another thing entirely to see the game&#x27;s community demonstrate real compassion when someone they&#x27;re only connected to through a fictional universe loses their life.

Yesterday, the Helldivers 2 community struck a blow for Super Earth against the Automatons by finally liberating Troost. This was the first part of an operation spread across a few Major Orders, and once the second one appeared, players leaped into action, eager to maintain their momentum. As is so often the case in war, though, the celebrations and victory were short-lived, as Arrowhead Game Studios revealed a move from the Automatons that&#x27;s going to split players across the galaxy.

                              <span>Bungie has made a compromise following community backlash surrounding the time-gating of Into the Light weapons. Instead of releasing the second half of the Brave Arsenal through May 21, all weapons will become available by April 30. While there are still three weeks between the start of Into the Light and the full Brave Arsenal, Bungie&#x27;s willingness to reverse this unpopular decision is a victory within itself.


Into the Light is an April 9 content update for Destiny 2. While there&#x27;s still more to be revealed in Bungie&#x27;s upcoming streams, the studio has already shown off the Onslaught horde mode and rewards for the update. Following up on its second stream, Bungie shared a Dev Insight post adding further context to the Brave Arsenal&#x27;s reveal. Toward the end of the communication, Bungie r…</span>

                              <span>Get them &#x27;Eclipsed, pronto.
We&#x27;re big fans of Digital Eclipse&#x27;s work, especially the studio&#x27;s recent approach to documenting the stories of landmark games and their creators, exploring video game history in the medium&#x27;s native habitat. Atari 50 was its first &#x27;interactive documentary&#x27; title to launch, with The Making of Karateka kicking off the &#x27;Gold Master Series&#x27; in August 2023 followed by Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story just recently.

The surprising phenomenon of indies casting Hollywood talent continues with Open Roads, a three-hour narrative adventure. But then this is the latest release from Annapurna Interactive, a publisher of both films and games, which has a few similarly voice-acted examples in its back catalogue – the delectable The Artful Escape and less-well-received 12 Minutes to name a couple.
Open Roads is the product of Open Roads Team, a studio made up of former Fullbright (Gone Home, Tacoma) employees. It began as a Fullbright project until allegations of toxic workplace behaviour led to the departure of creative lead and company co-founder Steve Gaynor; following delays, development eventually continued with much of the original team under the new name.

The weekend is here, which means it&#x27;s time to dive into what we&#x27;ve all got planned with our Switches (and other consoles too, we guess).
Before that, however, let&#x27;s take a look at what&#x27;s been going on this week. First up, the Switch got its latest firmware update, and although it&#x27;s not the most exciting thing in the world, we always appreciate a bit more stability with our consoles. Nintendo also announced that F-Zero Maximum Velocity would be coming to NSO (and it&#x27;s out now!), while rumours started to gather pace about a potential Xbox handheld to give the Switch a bit of competition.

Just a reminder that you&#x27;ve got just over a week until the online servers for 3DS and Wii U are taken offline on 8th April 2024. There&#x27;s still time to enjoy some online play with the original Splatoon, then — just not long!
The Wii U and 3DS eShops closed on Monday 27th March, 2023. The North American stores closed at 5:00 PM PT / 8:00 PM ET.

The blue blur is back in the headlines this week with the Sonic 3 movie director Jeff Fowler yesterday confirming the latest movie has now wrapped. Apart from this, Paramount is also gearing up for the release of the Knuckles series, which will air on its streaming service next month.
With this mind it&#x27;s now released a new promotional poster seemingly drawing inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s original animated movie outing dating back to the &#x27;90s. As highlighted by Nintendo Wire, Knuckles is wearing a cowboy hat in this new post, which is a direct throwback to the animation.

With so many excellent platformers available on Switch, picking something out from the overwhelming selection can be hard. The genre has a very strong pedigree on Nintendo systems going all the way back to the original Super Mario Bros. on NES (which you can find on Switch along with several of its celebrated sequels via the Nintendo Switch Online NES and Super NES games).

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The four-part series features interviews with thirty of the game&#x27;s lead designers, such as director Naoki Hamaguchi, creative director Tetsuya Nomura, and producer Yoshinori Kitase, who discuss how Square brought Rebirth to life.
Each episode tackles different aspects of Rebirth.

Each episode runs between 15-18 minutes. You can watch the first episode below.

                              <span>Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.
Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. 


The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. 
Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.</span>

                              <span>Lightyear Frontier doesn&#x27;t have much of a story per se, but it does include what you can refer to as an overarching mission geared toward world progression. Here&#x27;s how you can restore all regions in Lightyear Frontier, with the needed tool upgrades.


That mission I mentioned is opening a massive door, behind which is a mystery. To start unlocking it, you need to begin completing missions about restoring the corrupted regions of the game. Doing so requires you to upgrade two tools necessary to finish the job.


Restoring the world of Lightyear Frontier to its proper place requires you to upgrade both the Vacuum Harvester and Irrigation Hose. The tools are found during the game&#x27;s tutorial where you wander about gathering your lost equipment.

Personally, Warframe fascinates me. It&#x27;s one of those constant &quot;always games,&quot; like EVE Online, that lingers on my periphery until some big news or wild story reminds me that it&#x27;s got a fervent, engaged, huge fan base. I point this out to clarify that my handful of hours in Warframe don&#x27;t really qualify me as a &quot;Warframe player.&quot;


So when I sat down with four big names behind Warframe, I approached it as such. Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford, Soulframe creative Geoff Crookes, community director Megan Everett, and voice actor Ben Starr were all in town for PAX East, hostin…</span>

To unlock the Weather Station in Lightyear Frontier, you first need to discover its blueprint by collecting certain materials. Softwood and Copper Wire are used in its construction, and gathering the latter will most likely drop the blueprint into your space farmer&#x27;s hands. Once you have the instructions on how to build it, you can easily do so after gathering the necessary resources. Naturally, that requires a few steps.

Stuck on Cache Cleanup in Progress


The most common way to fix the Cache cleanup in progress error is to start by restarting Path of Exile. However, there&#x27;s some other fixes that have worked as well.

The in-universe casino is home to plenty of painstaking MMO grinds and some of them gate beloved mounts, minions, and titles. The Gold Saucer&#x27;s currency, MGP, stands between you and those prizes.


Ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t have to be the most miserable, grindy experience, and you can make the best use of your time with a few of my favorite FFXIV MGP farming tips. My guiding advice here: prioritize any MGP event, seek every MGP Platinum Card you can, and do Challenge Log weeklies.

                              <span>The Brine is one of the first enemies players are introduced to in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, though they might not realize it, and it&#x27;s going to be a pain for the entire game. 


If you haven&#x27;t played the original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma, then you might not know that The Brine is an enemy that spans both games. It&#x27;s been part of the lore of this world since ancient times, long before players began their stories. For me, that makes it even more terrifying because somehow it&#x27;s managed to avoid being killed for what must be thousands of years, to the point where civilization simply coexists with monsters that will kill anything that ventures into deep water. This is the lore of The Brine and an explanation for why you shouldn&#x27;t go swimming in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.

As you make your way around Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s world, you&#x27;ll become pretty confident in using the oxcarts to travel between major locations. This is something I spent ages doing early on because I just wanted to see as many places as possible and explore as much of the map as I could without tackling the main quest. However, when I entered Border Checkpoint Town, which you travel to from Vernworth, I was informed that I should check out the Cenotaph. I had no idea what this was or where to find it, but it&#x27;s worth seeking out.

You can even do it with friends, who can join with their own customizable machinery. But can you play Lightyear Frontier cross-platform?


The news is good for interstellar farmers: You can indeed play Lightyear Frontier cross-platform. Users on Xbox or PC via Steam can join together to make the extraterrestrial ranch of their dreams. The process isn&#x27;t much different than what you&#x27;re used to if you&#x27;ve played with people across different platforms before.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a fungus fight happening in the Underdark, and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 demands you either side with Glut or Spaw to settle it. It&#x27;s another BG3 quest that quickly escalates into a blood bath if you aren&#x27;t careful, but things don&#x27;t have to end that way.


So, whether you&#x27;re interested in sewing a little chaos or making peace, we&#x27;ll explain here whether you should side with Glut or Spaw, plus outline how to complete quests like Avenge Glut&#x27;s Circle.


Should you side with Glut or Spaw?


In most Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 scenarios, you should side with Spaw. At least, that&#x27;s my personal recommendation in a game where there&#x27;s no real right or wrong way, it&#x27;s just juggling the roleplaying with your strategic wants and needs. 


Both Sovereign Spaw and Glut hang out in the Underdark&#x27;s Myconid Colony. You…</span>

The latest news suggests one horrific development: flying Automaton dropships.


Indeed, Helldiver forces have been remarkably successful in severing some key Automaton supply lines to get more information about what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes. Yet, things may be about to heat up like never before, as we&#x27;ve received updates that there&#x27;s a &quot;new Automaton type&quot; being developed on the sly: aerial gunships. If this doesn&#x27;t ring a bell or two, might we point out that something delightfully similar happened with the Terminid, too, as bug flyers began spawning in ever-greater numbe…</span>

                              <span>The great appeal of Phasmophobia is playing ghost hunter, investigating a number of locations to determine which apparition is keeping its occupants up at night. Along the way, you&#x27;re given the tools needed to pinpoint exactly which spirit type is about to haunt your ass. 


Each ghost also has a number of traits that help you to identify what you&#x27;re dealing with, even without the use of a night vision camera or D.O.T.S projector.


Additionally, the game has a number of Cursed Possessions. While they can be of great help, the name strongly implies there&#x27;s a Faustian bargain accompanying them, which can result in your demise. One of those is the Monkey Paw, so we&#x27;ll break down how said Monkey Paw and its Cursed Wishes work in Phasmophobia.

                              <span>Retro charm aplenty but no purring.
As one of the earliest animated characters dating back to the silent film era, Felix the Cat’s popularity has waxed and waned over the decades. His charm, though, continues to endure beyond his centenary. He may be the only cartoon mascot older than Mickey Mouse to have also tried their hand at the Super Mario Bros. formula in a side-scrolling platformer, too.
Originally published by Hudson Software in 1992, Felix’s foray into video games came relatively late in the Nintendo Entertainment System’s (NES) lifespan alongside a heavily condensed port on the Game Boy. The titles are well remembered by those who played them but have fallen into relative obscurity and now fetch eye-watering sums on the second-hand market.

As such, he goes on to endorse &quot;work&quot; games such as PowerWash Simulator, Car Simulator, House Flipper, and Cookie Clicker. Basically, games that don&#x27;t offer up what many would deem &#x27;traditional&#x27; game mechanics, but are nevertheless fun to play in their own way.

It might feel like a long time since Pepper Grinder was unearthed for Switch at the November 2022 Indie World Showcase, but it has been even longer for Riv Hester, the game&#x27;s solo developer at studio Ahr Ech, who first dug up the idea seven years ago.
This is Sonic the Hedgehog meets Drill Dozer (by way of a little Shovel Knight), as you glide booty-less pirate Pepper through a series of burrow-able stages with their trusty drill, Grinder, to reclaim their stolen fortunes.

Thunderful Group is once again back in the news today as it has been reported that the studio is selling Pumpkin Jack publisher Headup at a fraction of what it was bought for back in 2021.
Word of this sale comes to us from Gamesindustry.biz which reports that Thunderful has sold the publisher for €500,000 — quite the drop from the €11 million it spent to acquire the company just three years ago.

Hazelight Studios, the developer behind the charming co-op adventure It Takes Two, has announced that the game has now sold over 16 million copies.
Although it only launched on the Nintendo Switch in November 2022, the game has been out on other platforms since March 2021. It gained significant critical acclaim for its co-op gameplay and touching storyline, winning Game of the Year and Best Family Game at The Game Awards in 2021.

We are approaching six months (!!) since Super Mario Bros. Wonder leapt onto Switch, and while the launch chit-chat was dominated by the vocal talents of Kevin Afghani — the new voice of Mario — it turns out that the voice acting performance we should have been talking about was one by Nintendo&#x27;s own Koji Kondo (thanks, GamesRadar).
Note. We are about to head into some discussion of Mario Wonder&#x27;s final Badge. If you are still grinding out the platformer to discover its secrets yourself then we&#x27;d suggest looking away now. If not, brace for potential spoilers ahead.

Well, this isn&#x27;t something you see everyday. Over in Japan, a McDonald&#x27;s-branded Nintendo DSi briefly went on sale in a second-hand hardware store before being promptly delisted (thanks, Automaton).
For those who may be unaware, McDonald&#x27;s had produced specialised DSi consoles containing software called &#x27;eCrew Development Program&#x27; that would effectively serve as training tools for the staff (and you can see exactly what it looks like here). These were utilised until 2018 when the firm switched over to tablets.

There are some other small tweaks too, while Capcom dare to raise the question about future DLC in the wake of the game’s controversial microtransactions.

                              <span>Windowkill is the most inventive arcade shooter I&#x27;ve played for years.
It&#x27;s twin-stick shooting in a tiny window that temporarily expands in that direction when you shoot its edges. You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you&#x27;ll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.
It&#x27;s a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I played a game as effortlessly cool as Underdogs. This VR mech-fighting game has you pilot a giant mechanical gorilla, pummelling robots and human-controlled mechs with arms the length of lorries in grungy, trap-filled arenas. The combat alone is chest-thumpingly good, but Underdogs couples it with a fantastically evocative cyberpunk setting, and a smartly implemented rogue-like structure.

                              <span>So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.
I think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.

                              <span>I think its reasonable to say that the term ‘fetch quest’ is well passed the point of being a neutral descriptor and has moved firmly into the realm of full pejorative. You won&#x27;t see many games tout ‘epic fetch quests’ on their Steam Page, and you’re much more likely to hear the term lodged between the words ‘not a bloody’ and ‘again’, like two slices of exasperation-enriched bread stuffed with a shit-tier filling. Cucumber, perhaps. Not so, at least not for me, when it comes to Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. The action RPG game has more or less solved the fetch quest problem. All it took, it turns out, was some interesting world design.

I meet the news that it&#x27;s getting a VR version this year with some trepidation, therefore. Do I really want to vomit on the beat?

                              <span>Earlier today, megacorp Embracer announced they were selling Borderlands developer Gearbox to Take-Two. During an investor call about the divestment, CEO Lars Wingefors confirmed that this brought an end to the restructuring process Embracer announced last year. He was also asked whether this meant Embracer had plans to start acquiring other studios again.

Wingefors said it was &quot;way too early&quot; to restart &quot;the M&amp;A engines.&quot;

                              <span>A regular rogue&#x27;s gallery of independent game developers - including the makers of Dead Cells, Slay The Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Spiritfarer, Terraria and V Rising - have clubbed together to run their own videogame showcase: the Triple-I Initiative. Initially screening on 10th April, it&#x27;ll be a 45-minute, unhosted, back-to-back series of trailers, reveals and surprise game or demo releases, designed (as per the press release) &quot;to highlight fan-favorite games and hype up established indie classics as well as new IPs&quot;. It could become a yearly thing, but that&#x27;ll obviously depend on how well the first showcase goes down.


According to a few of the organisers, the IIIIs - as they shall now and forever be known - reflect a high level of anxiety even among more established indie teams about finding an audience, together with a feeling that they aren&#x27;t being served by existing showcases like the Geoffies, with their blockbuster headliners, celebrity cameos and extended Kojima soliloquies.

Ever the afterthought, Generals has shimmered between abandonware and temporarily available in some obscure place with no fanfare (I think? I honestly lost track) for years, but it&#x27;s now available in a bundle on Steam as part of whatever needlessly awkward thing EA are doing this month. There&#x27;s suddenly an opportunity to get into why its design and atmosphere make it probably my favourite of the whole collection, and why I wish I could say that without adding that it indulges in a lot of boring early-00s racism.

                              <span>Alongside announcing plans to buy Borderlands developers Gearbox from the collapsing wreckage of Embracer Group, Borderlands publishers Take-Two overnight casually mentioned that they are &quot;in active development on next installment in Borderlands series&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a formal announcement as much as a businessblast to hype shareholders, so it didn&#x27;t have anything specific to say about what Gearbox are up to with their wildly popular and deeply unfunny looter shooter series. It had seemed curious that the much-delayed Borderlands movie was coming out five years after the latest main series game and with no new one in sight.

                              <span>Pepper Grinder is one of those games that has so many great moments in it that recounting them would almost feel unfair to anyone hoping to play it. There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it&#x27;s also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.

                              <span>A month ago Arrowhead&#x27;s CEO revealed the existence of Joel (technically J.O.E.L., in game), a game master running the galactic battle of Helldivers 2. A human being who gets up in the middle of the night to throw more robots at players if they&#x27;re doing too well. We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting. Plus a straw poll indicates that only one of us would enjoy be at the middle of a maelstrom of chaos and being the Helldivers GM as a job. Bet you can absolutely guess which one of us it was.

                              <span>You know me and Soulslikes. We&#x27;re not particularly best buddies most of the time. We&#x27;ve had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death&#x27;s Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the &#x27;git gud&#x27; camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It&#x27;s all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you&#x27;re finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It&#x27;s all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that&#x27;s just launched on Steam, I&#x27;d strongly recommend giving it a go if you&#x27;re feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve griped before that Warhammer 40,000 Darktide hides satisfying challenges behind tedious grind, but another interesting challenge is easily missed and forgotten at the opposite end of the scale. Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It&#x27;s a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I&#x27;ve started a new character who&#x27;ll never learn skills or get a good gun. She&#x27;s quite bad, and that&#x27;s quite fun.

                              <span>Today I learned that ‘Wanko’ is Japanese for dog, rather than just being Aussie slang in the vein of ‘smoko’ or my favourite, &#x27;bottle-o&#x27;, which is what they call an off-license. I learnt this because of Doronko Wanko, a lovely free game about a dirty pomeranian where you try to score as high as possible by doing actual, financial damage to your owner’s home.

As for Warzone, highlights include the return of fan-favourite Rebirth Island, biometric scanners, new perks, and four new weapons. Let me break the details down for you, like how I used to break my friends&#x27; spirits by sprinting at enemies without communicating my intentions, going down, then spectating as they attempted to pick up the pieces.

                              <span>Stardew Valley, one of our favourite RPGs despite coming out almost a decade ago, still has an attentive steward in the form of developer Eric Barone. After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing &#x27;excess trash&#x27; to be fished.
Importantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don&#x27;t have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie&#x27;s. This is lovely.

                              <span>Embracer have announced that they&#x27;re selling Borderlands developers Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive, owners of 2K Games and GTA 6 developers Rockstar, for $460 million in Take-Two shares. Three Gearbox Software studios - the flagship studio in Texas, together with Gearbox Montréal and Gearbox Quebec - will change hands as part of the deal. Take-Two will also acquire the Borderlands and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands franchises, together with Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem.


Embracer will keep and rename Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, previously known as Perfect World Entertainment. They&#x27;re also hanging onto Cryptic Studios, who went through a round of layoffs in November, together with their MMOs Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online. They&#x27;re also clinging onto Borderlands 3 support studio Lost Boys Interactive, who went through a round of layoffs in January, plus 3D scanning and reconstruction outfit Captured Dimensions. Last but not least, they&#x27;ll keep the publishing rights to the Remnant series, Hyper Light Breaker and &quot;other notable unannounced game releases&quot;.

And now, players are learning that snowballs can lead to some of these far-too-frequent crashes.

                              <span>Embracer Group has divested Gearbox Entertainment from its stable of video game studios, with Take-Two Interactive purchasing the company for $460 million. This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. 
This move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…</span>

Cover story writer and editor Marcus Stewart and I traveled to Vienna, Austria, to play the game and speak with two of its leads, tech and production director and studio co-founder Gennadiy Korol and studio CEO and creative director Thomas Mahler. 
However, while the frosted glass of the front door of the two-story apartment we entered was engraved with the words &quot;Moon Studios&quot;, this studio is actually just Mahler&#x27;s workplace.

Sometimes, all it takes to get started on a great game is to come up with a compelling mechanic, and Pepper Grinder is a prime example. The titular grinder is as powerful as it is versatile, able to drill through the ground and power all sorts of wacky devices. The difficulty curve can be choppy, and ends more quickly than it should, but that core mechanic builds a sturdy foundation that kept me entertained from start to finish. 
That core mechanic is, of course, the Grinder, a conical drilling device protagonist Pepper uses to burrow through terrain, spin switches, and defeat ene…</span>

Once a tentpole franchise in the popular run-and-gun subgenre of action games, Contra has experienced a stark downturn in recent decades. Konami&#x27;s (mostly) side-scrolling shooter franchise has often gone long stretches without a release, and the games that have come out in recent years range from middling to downright bad. With Contra: Operation Galuga, Konami taps renowned retro-style developer WayForward, best known for its work on the Shantae series, to bring the once-renowned series back to its roo…</span>

                              <span>Celeste and Towerfall developer Extremely OK Games has announced its next game, Earthblade, has been delayed. The fantasy platformer was scheduled to launch sometime this year but has now been pushed to an undetermined window.
Earthblade was first announced in April 2021 before getting its first trailer at The Game Awards in 2022. The fantasy &quot;explor-action&quot; platformer stars Névoa, a child of fate who returns to uncover the mysteries of a fractured Earth. The game appears to be inspired by the Metroidvania subgenre, with the studio stating it features &quot;seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart.&quot; Outside of PC, Earthblade has no announced platforms.

Riggs byl zodpovědný za většinu enterprise funkcí PostgreSQL, včetně point-in-time recovery, synchronní replikace a hot standby.

                              <span>In 2020, indie studio Yellow Brick Games was formed by a collection of industry veterans with experience on triple-A franchises such as Dragon Age, Assassins’ Creed, and Mass Effect. After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.
The studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. 


The studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.

Yellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a &quot;people first&quot; work culture where employees&#x27; wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, &quot;deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.&quot;
&quot;We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release&quot;Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”</span>

                              <span>Sand Land comes from the mind of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, and despite the manga existing for over 20 years, it&#x27;s never received a video game until now. Its epoynomous video game debut is a open world action RPG featuring an original story, and after fans got to try a recent public demo, we traveled to Bandai Namco to check out never-before-seen sections of the game. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a new dungeon and boss fight from Sand Land, along with peeks at Forest Land and the game&#x27;s deep vehicle customization.

MLB The Show’s commitment to nuance, iteration, and diversity is what sets it apart. Since the long-running series arrived on Xbox in 2021, the baseball sim has recontextualized sports games – emphasizing the purpose of communities while fitting in new features like Pinpoint Pitching, custom stadiums, and online ranked co-op.

There’s a bit of a catch for now, though, in that it’s only a beta test for now with a small selection of games supported. Still, it’s something!

Apparently, the original was a dark fantasy action RPG with roguelike elements and MMO subscription models before developer Flagship Studios shut down. Then it was re-released a bunch of times, with London giving way to Tokyo in one expansion. Now, Hellgate&#x27;s original creator Bill Roper has announced he&#x27;s working on a brand new Hellgate game under his new studio Lunacy Games.

                              <span>Not every March-released, fantastical action-RPG will fall to bits on the Steam Deck. Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition succeeds where Dragon’s Dogma 2 spluttered, quietly yet capably adapting to handheld hardware. Keeping performance up requires a fair bit of fine-tuning the graphics settings, and a girthsome install size might trouble the internal drives of smaller models, but otherwise, Forbidden West is just as portable-friendly as Horizon Zero Dawn. And that’s still one of the best Steam Deck games around.

                              <span>I went into Open Roads pretty cold, knowing only that it was a story-driven road trip game with some element of mystery to it. The mystery is really just a backdrop, though - a device to better bring forth the themes of family and secrets. Most specifically it&#x27;s about mother-daughter relationships, as we join single mum Opal and her sixteen-year-old daughter Tess on a short (from our point of view) but bittersweet road trip when, going through Opal&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home post-funeral, they discover she may have had an affair decades before. Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter? If you left your daughter&#x27;s early-00s flip phone back at the motel, would you turn around and lose four hours, or hope it&#x27;s still there on the way back?

                              <span>I approve of the recent trend towards making building games as relaxing as possible (e.g. Summerhouse). Today sees the release of a new one on Steam, this one a teeny medieval city builder called Le Château that gives you strict limitations for building a castle. You can have a go of the demo for free - I like it a bunch.

                              <span>A couple of decades ago there was a period when all videogames and especially all Unreal Engine videogames had to be brown and grey and dingy. &quot;The Gears of Warrification of graphics,&quot; we used to call it, huddled up in the chest-high trenches with our Xbox 360 controllers. Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. 


Developers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.

                              <span>Is there a developer more fiendishly dedicated to giving fans endless returns on their initial investment than No Man’s Sky studio Hello Games? It’s not a competition, mind, but they’d surely be a strong contender if it were. Despite dropping the Omega update just last month, and unveiling fantasy survival game Light No Fire at last year’s Geoffies, the team are back once more with the Orbital update. It looks to be a sizeable one too, with ship customisation and a “complete space station overhaul” among the new features. You can read the full patch notes here. I hope it includes a note about how much sleep they’re all getting, because I’m starting to worry.

                              <span>Like the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.
This look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.

                              <span>In case Amy Hennig&#x27;s Captain America and Black Panther game 1943: Rise Of Hydra wasn&#x27;t going to be quite enough to satisfy your Marvel hunger, Netease have just announced they&#x27;ve got another comic book bun in the oven for you. Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play, third-person team shooter where two teams of six heroes and villains go head to head with each other in destructible arenas. I can&#x27;t say its reveal trailer has me particularly pumped - the game looks and feels a bit like it&#x27;s ten years too late. Still, why not come and have a gander at it below.

                              <span>When Herbert Spencer coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; to describe Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory, I&#x27;m pretty sure he didn&#x27;t envisage the rise of a species of videogame, the survival sim, which would one day itself suffer an unsustainable population explosion during the layoff-ridden years of 2023 and 2024. What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you&#x27;re Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you&#x27;re Enshrouded, it&#x27;s all about having a really neat building system. And if you&#x27;re Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms.

                              <span>Is there a definitive geological difference between rock and stone? Google tells me the main consensus is that stones are just smaller rocks, which sounds like a flimsy distinction to base a catchphrase on. I’m not sure when this would come up, unless maybe you were a biblical heretic trying to dunk on the people bludgeoning you to death by correcting them in some last gasp pettiness, but it still bothers me. Anyway, colony survival game First Dwarf cares not for rock, only stone, along with the wood you’ll use as the building blocks of your colonies. This is me burying the lede deeper than the mines of Moria, of course, because First Dwarf also has a tiny talking dragon companion that sits on the shoulder of the giant dwarven mech you use to swing a hammer at horrible toxic shitlizards. The dragon learnt your language by sneaking herself in a library. Do go on, game.

                              <span>Fallen London and Sunless Skies developers Failbetter Games have blogged about the dark art of running a sustainable business, while sharing a tiny bit more about their next, unannounced game. Said game is apparently a change of genre from Failbetter&#x27;s previous, exceedingly narrative-driven open world titles and free-to-play RPGs. It&#x27;ll also be a little less oppressive, aiming for a feeling of &quot;fireside menace&quot; - that is, &quot;an awareness of the world&#x27;s dangers, but also warmth and comfort&quot;, which certainly feels like an appropriate mood for a time of mass layoffs and game cancellations, to say nothing of recent conspiracy-fuelled harassment campaigns.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the post-apocalyptic wilderness, the giant dinosaur robots return. In fact, they never left! Go-gettin&#x27;, arrow-shootin&#x27; warrior Aloy managed to delay the end of the world in Horizon Zero Dawn, but the death train is still chugging along to all life on Earth station via a (currently resonant) eco-disaster. In Horizon Forbidden West it&#x27;s because the AI created to heal the planet from the prior extinction event caused by humans isn&#x27;t working properly. Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy&#x27;s job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It&#x27;ll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.

                              <span>Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven&#x27;t played it, have I, so I&#x27;ll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.
Not least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now.

                              <span>On March 31st, Ubisoft&#x27;s open world racing game The Crew will be turned off for good. As of right now, no one can buy the ten-year-old racer, but come the end of the month, even those that did buy it will no longer be able to play it.

On April 18th, The Crew Motorfest will arrive on Steam after several months available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft&#x27;s own launcher, providing a new venue to buy the third entry in the series. Or perhaps that should be &quot;rent&quot;.

                              <span>I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to &quot;a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it&#x27;s 1000 metres in extent&quot;. Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?


Still, I&#x27;m very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it&#x27;s the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based &quot;immersive experiences&quot; and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it&#x27;s a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it&#x27;s inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet &quot;secret cities&quot; given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn&#x27;t make the last bus out of town.

                              <span>Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it&#x27;s an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,&quot; says Levine. 


Judas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness.

                              <span>If you’ve  read my duology on spending far too long queuing in Hitman, you’ll know I’ve a predilection for the virtual people watching of NPCs in games that have some sort of schedule system. &quot;It’s a wholesome pursuit of game design knowledge!&quot; I stammer, as the guards approach. &quot;It gives me a greater appreciation for the obscure details lurking in the hidden corners of virtual cities!&quot; I protest, as I’m clapped in chains after being caught staring through a blacksmiths window for four hours watching him eat the same heel of bread, rubbing my hands together and grinning manically. Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.
Alfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.

Besides being a sumptuous, endlessly satisfying sci-fi romp with one of the prettiest open worlds in gaming, it’s also a very respectable porting job, with stable performance that scales well on aged PC hardware all the way up to glistening 4K rigs.
There are some imperfections, but generally, this shouldn’t be a repeat of Horizon Zero Dawn’s need for a post-launch patch regimen. On all the hardware I’ve tested, Forbidden West looks good to go, especially when choosing the right settings can smooth out performance even more.

                              <span>Swashbuckling third-person action-RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is, amongst other things, a gentle homage to New Zealand, developer A44 Games&#x27;s country of origin. You do have to look for it, mind you. The game&#x27;s art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.
Main character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking &quot;blackpowder&quot; pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed &quot;Hosts&quot; that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor&#x27;s spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology.

                              <span>Troubled city building game Cities: Skylines 2 is getting a little less troubled, as new patch 1.1.0f1 adds various performance and bug fixes alongside the main event: much requested mod support and tools in the form a nifty editor. We got a first look at the new editor tools last October, which looks to simplify the process by combining what was previously several different separate editors into a single application. It was later available only to some closed beta testers, but is now released for everyone. Emphasis on everyone, actually, since the tool looks refreshingly approachable, even for those with basically no modding experience.

                              <span>Maintaining the thrum of a finely-tuned citybuilder has to be one of the most satisfying acts of video game plate-spinning around. Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that&#x27;s the good stuff right there. Of course, it&#x27;s not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it&#x27;s the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it&#x27;s just that they won&#x27;t ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.
Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of &#x27;relaxed&#x27; and &#x27;something more&#x27;. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you&#x27;re free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.

                              <span>Yesterday I posted a story about Helldivers 2 game master Joel, which showed him delivering an unreleased vehicle to a random group of players before vanishing into the ether. But this morning came a thunderous plot twist. Someone on team RPS was contacted by a verified source with first hand knowledge of Joel&#x27;s shady activities. The source has confirmed that APC-deliverer Joel isn&#x27;t anything but an imposter, a fake, a generous fraud. The Real Joel, it seems, isn&#x27;t so brazen with his actions.

                              <span>Palia, a cute-looking life sim MMO inspired by e.g. Stardew Valley, has been in beta since last year, but now it&#x27;s officially out on Steam, where many more people can download and play it. With this launch comes a pretty substantial update - Patch 0.178, full notes here - which adds a new questline and Temple to explore, new furniture, and a bunch of new spring flowers and trees to grow in your garden. There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under &#x27;Adjustments&#x27;. The patch notes say simply &quot;What does he want? Does he come in peace?&quot; which makes him sound way more sinister than I think he is, but as you can see from the screenshot, he isn&#x27;t not sinister.

For anyone currently gathered around the hill, searching the pockets of their N7 hoodies for more heavy objects to fling at me, however, here’s some good news: the as-yet unnamed Mass Effect 5  is in the capable hands of “trilogy vets”, according to project director Michael Gamble, via Le Epic Musk Zone (OP didn’t steal), formerly Twitter.

                              <span>The source code of Italian anti-piracy platform Piracy Shield appears to have been leaked online. Nine repositories claim to contain everything from the front end, data models, storage and filesystem, through to the platform&#x27;s API and internal documentation. Presented with a manifesto of sorts, the unknown leaker claims that Piracy Shield &quot;isn&#x27;t just a failed attempt to combat online piracy,&quot; it&#x27;s a &quot;dangerous gateway&quot; to censorship &quot;disguised as a solution to piracy.&quot;

                              <span>Following at least two major blocking blunders at Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield system that were initially denied, it was hoped that authorities would take the opportunity to be more transparent. While that has failed to emerge, live data from the Piracy Shield platform is now being made available via an unofficial third-party service. That has revealed yet more blocking blunders, this time involving Akamai IPs.

It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.
For those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it&#x27;s no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.
Thirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.
The relevant section says, &quot;Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.&quot;
There&#x27;s really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there&#x27;s no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft&#x27;s private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.

                              <span>We love gaming magazines, and we&#x27;re hoping if you&#x27;re here, you do too. But ours can only survive with support from you. For $19.91 (the year of GI&#x27;s founding), our new standalone magazine subscription program sends a full year of 10 issues to your doorstep, filled with exclusive cover stories, in-depth interviews with game creators, long-form features and retrospectives, previews of what&#x27;s coming next in the gaming hobby, reviews of the most compelling games, and more.

New amicus briefs are signed by former U.S. politicians, former judges, and legal scholars. Industry groups such as the MPA and RIAA also rally behind the publishers.

Expected imminently, the blockade is Telegram&#x27;s punishment for not helping to identify IPTV pirates. Described as “necessary” and “proportional” by the judge, the order was made on behalf of rightsholders pursuing a private criminal prosecution.

                              <span>Remember when Ark: Survival Evolved was announced to be getting an animated series with a star-studded cast including the likes of Michelle Yeoh, Russell Crowe, Elliot Page, David Tennant and Malcolm-bloody-McDowell? I sure didn’t! That was over three years ago during the heights of a worldwide pandemic, though, so I think we can forgive ourselves a little. Anyway, Ark: The Animated Series has now arrived out of the blue, dropping its first six episodes on streaming service Paramount+.

Into that debate has waded the CEO of graphics card giants Nvidia to drop a prediction that can only be described as searingly flammable: we’ll see games where everything seen on-screen is fully generated by AI, in real-time, within the next 10 years.

But that one dull spot has already been polished out by modders, who are offering more convenient (and less expensive) ways to pick up items that you’ll either need to potentially grind or cough up real money for.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It&#x27;s the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.
Millennia is perhaps the Civ-like that&#x27;s clung most tightly to the genre&#x27;s apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they&#x27;re clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t a particularly good student.

                              <span>Here’s one for all you connoisseurs of the horrific consequences of your own actions. Regicide-em-up visual novel Slay the Princess’ new update brings with it new dialogue and music, fleshing out the game with additional choices, expanded scenes, and orchestral renditions of some choice tracks. The new content takes the form of new animations and “more than 3,000 words of additional and restructured dialogue choices and conversations.” That is easily enough words to tell the Stanley Parable-esque narrator that you’re on to him and whatever mind games he’s playing, with enough left over for the other voices in your head to make you doubt your own morality with alarming frequency.

                              <span>One of my favourite things about Helldivers 2 is the fact it&#x27;s home to a human game master,  known as &quot;Joel&quot;, who controls the narrative. Joel&#x27;s been known to leave surprises, namely mechs before they officially launched a while back. And now he&#x27;s seemingly granted a group of lucky players the chance to ride about in an armoured truck outfitted with guns. Maybe, just maybe this signals their imminent release?

The work of Struct9 founder Matej Vanco, it hands you a distressingly unwieldy and roofless hovership and cuts you adrift in a vast ocean of malevolent mathematics.

                              <span>At first glance, this shadow-hopping top-downer looks like a nostalgic stealth game designed to evoke the boxy subterranean environments of the first Metal Gear Solid. But really it is a tough single-player fighting game with stealth bits attached. It is closer in design to kung-fu brawler Sifu than it is to any of Solid Snake&#x27;s various mischiefs. And while this mash-up of influences intrigues me, it can also feel like a layer cake of awkwardly clashing flavours. Like that very pretty but questionable cake, Raw Metal feels a little underbaked.

                              <span>Graham wrote about WitchHand last month when the game came out. He compared it to Stacklands, and I can see where he was coming from. It&#x27;s a cute, deckbuilding strategy game where you&#x27;re a witch building up strength to take on some horrible void-y demon-y things. It has much higher stakes than Stacklands, but most importantly, you summon cat familiars in it, and they go &#x27;meow!&#x27;

                              <span>There’s a teaser image on the wall. We stare at it and we think that’s the whole multiplayer shooter set in the Control franchise. Then, Remedy sneak a second teaser image alongside some tantalising lore snippets into their latest investor report (Thanks, resetera!) Also there’s an air fryer that turns nuggets into miniature black holes, or something. I’m not sure because, honestly, I never learned to appreciate Control’s wonderful architecture and lore because the combat made me want to gnaw my fingers off. Good news, then, for everyone except me specifically. We’ve got a few more scraps of info about its (presumably) almost entirely combat focused spin-off title, currently known as ‘Condor’.

Many of the pre-order and special edition bonus items players can get with the upcoming Dawntrail expansion are suspiciously FF9-themed, you see, but when pointing this out to PAX-goers, Yoshi-P said &quot;the reason is a secret&quot; for now, sparking fresh rumours about Square Enix&#x27;s supposed Final Fantasy IX remake/remaster.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by the feature every single video game on this green Earth should have (a grappling hook), along with waterparks, a plant knight, a chunky shotgun, a kitbashed hovercarrier, and heaps more. Check out all these attractive and interesting indie games!

                              <span>GTA 6 is facing development troubles, leaving leadership “nervous” that the hotly anticipated open world crime-athon could be “falling behind’ expected schedules. That’s according to Kotaku, who were told by an anonymous source that studio heads are “worried” that the game could miss 2025 completely and not see release until 2026. Kotaku were told that the studio is still “aiming” for a Spring 2025 release date, but sources feel Fall of the same year is more plausible. However, the title could be delayed until 2026 as a “fallback plan.”

                              <span>Fantasy action-RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has had a tumultuous launch week: praised by reviewers, slated for its performance issues, and berated for its microtransactions, which appear to have been stealthily added after the game was sent to critics. Now begins the labour of patching the game. Capcom have released a few hints about forthcoming Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 updates. Their plans for the PC version include letting players acquire dwellings earlier on in the story, improving quality when DLSS super resolution is enabled, and adding the option to start a new game when save data already exists.

As alluded to in The Maw this week, there hasn&#x27;t been much news out of Bend Studios since then, but they&#x27;re now hiring for a lead project manager for &quot;crafting our next high-profile AAA title.&quot; Another clue? The successful applicant must have experience &quot;with an emphasis on live operations&quot; and &quot;in leadership roles shipping AAA live service games&quot;. Hmmm.

The sun and sky bear down with a terrible, holy light and I can&#x27;t seem to conjure any warmth into my elbows. In the street outside, a small dog is barking. Soon, very soon, I will catch that dog, place it in a box and FedEx it to China.

                              <span>Last week, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 was released to critical acclaim followed by intense fan backlash. While the game itself is enjoyable to most, it launched with microtransactions that provide in-game currency, as well as a litany of technical issues for some players. Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the &quot;near future,&quot; but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.
In addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements. For starters, the Pawn Guild now sells a lot more &quot;Art of Metamorphosis&quot; items, which is how you can change the appearance of a character or pawn after they&#x27;ve already been created.

The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions.

                              <span>Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn&#x27;t officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game&#x27;s opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.


Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, &quot;This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story.&quot;
Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January&#x27;s State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.
Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

Today we release 14.0-RC3, hopefully the last release candidate before the proper 14.0 release. Compared to the previous RC, some annoying bugs were fixed and the latest translation updates included.

                              <span>I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>

                              <span>As elements of the UK media continue to stomp on reality in exchange for piracy-related clicks, a new story doing the rounds has managed to reach a new low. Accompanied by the usual dire warnings, the stories claim that a new overseas anti-piracy system has Brits &quot;braced for a crackdown&quot; because it could &quot;stop Brits watching illegal streams for good.&quot; Perhaps the Premier League should buy this system right now? Yeah, about that.

                              <span>Acolyte of the Altar, the roguelike deckbuilder with a wasteland twist from developer Black Kite Games, hits PC via Steam on March 25. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch next week, Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer, which features plenty of deckbuilder action and another taste of this Magic: The Gathering and Shadow of the Colossus-inspired game. 
&quot;Journey through desolate wastelands and hunt down colossal Beasts to grow stronger and serve your chosen Patron deity,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. 
Check out the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Acolyte of the Altar continues to look great (and spooky), and we&#x27;re excited to try our hands at its unique style of deckbuilder. 
&quot;Beware,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;Beasts grow stronger during battle, allowing them to consume your creatures or counter your spells. Carve profane Gifts from these behemoths and grow stronger to serve your Patron. But serve them to what end?&quot;
That is the question players will answer when Acolyte of the Altar hits PC via Steam on March 25, 2024. If you&#x27;re interested, you can play a demo of the game on Steam right now. 
Here are some Acolyte of the Altar screenshots to enjoy in the meantime:

                              <span>Velan Studios, the team behind Knockout City, has announced it is entering a reorganization that will likely result in layoffs. 
In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio&#x27;s co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

                              <span>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of the year’s most anticipated games, and by most accounts, the experience lives up to the hype. The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.
In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

                              <span>Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game&#x27;s expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game&#x27;s story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. 



Are you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game&#x27;s writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After its gorgeous Steam Next Fest demo last month, tiny little house builder Summerhouse has now arrived on Steam in full, launching just a couple of weeks ago on March 8th. I&#x27;ve been having a swell time with this over the last few days, particularly as I noodle about in the other big backdrops that weren&#x27;t available in its earlier demo.  
But there&#x27;s been another Summerhouse development this week that has arguably delighted me even more. Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword &amp; Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they&#x27;ve seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let&#x27;s make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah?

                              <span>Readers may be aware that I am a Warhammer 40K orbiter, but I am not of Warhammer 40K. Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.

                              <span>Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it&#x27;s also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year&#x27;s Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.

                              <span>Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn&#x27;t really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.
Passing By - A Tailwind Journey isn&#x27;t aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It&#x27;s the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you&#x27;re meant to go when they get around to it. It&#x27;s not a purely vibe-based game, but you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.

                              <span>Last time I checked, my pawn Bronco sat at 80 in the monthly leaderboard of the pawn global rankings. Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn&#x27;t quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn&#x27;t being picked up by adventurers as much as I&#x27;d like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I&#x27;m not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

                              <span>One of the neat things about massive Amazon sales, especially if you’re not keen on filling their coffers specifically, is that rival retailers often counter with big deals of their own. The best one I’ve seen during the current Amazon Spring sale is this Ebuyer offer on the excellent Crucial T500 SSD: the spacious 2TB model isn’t just cut down from £163 to £140, but it comes with a free Gamesplanet code for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.

The platform was featured unusually prominently and the studios seemed confident of the operators&#x27; whereabouts. Whatever the intent, DoodStream&#x27;s operators are now being sued by Hollywood, Netflix, Amazon and Apple, who apparently identified them as long ago as last summer.

                              <span>Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.</span>

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. &quot;We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that&#x27;s made to create DLCs or expansions,&quot; Vincke said. &quot;We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It&#x27;s not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it&#x27;s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.&quot;


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There&#x27;s no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there&#x27;s a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze&#x27;s in-development D&amp;D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft&#x27;s D&amp;D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since Balatro, the poker-inspired deckbuilding roguelite, was released, and it has taken the gaming world by storm. In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn&#x27;t share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…</span>

                              <span>Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we&#x27;re still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.</span>

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…</span>

There was no apology for the journalists accused of reporting &#x27;fake news&#x27;, or an apology for Cloudflare after disrupting its business. Meanwhile, Cloudflare will draw attention to overblocking by urging customers affected by the blunder to file official complaints.

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.

                              <span>Hyper Light Breaker is not a sequel to Hyper Light Drifter in the traditional sense, but it does take place in the same world, which is all we needed to hear to be excited. While this isn&#x27;t gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

                              <span>Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other&#x27;s methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance&#x27;s story consultant, Marc Bernardin.</span>

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard&#x27;s big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a &quot;massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,&quot; so if you&#x27;ve been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they&#x27;ll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here&#x27;s the rest of the line-up:

                              <span>Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&amp;D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&amp;D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&amp;D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&amp;D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&amp;D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

                              <span>The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It&#x27;s so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it&#x27;s unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.</span>

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it&#x27;s a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you&#x27;re marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it&#x27;s a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

                              <span>Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I&#x27;m so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can&#x27;t grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I&#x27;m so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.</span>

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member&#x27;s library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

                              <span>Nikdo asi nebude namítat, že Windows a Office od Microsoftu je nákladný software, bez ohledu na to, kdo jste. Dokud si ale neuvědomíte kde koupit OEM licence, na které jsou mnohem větší slevy než je jinak obvyklé. Právě teď je na Goodoffer24.com snaha o poskytnutí levnějších Windows 10 Pro, Office 2019 Professional, a čehokoliv mezi tím za skvělé ceny.</span>

                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>
