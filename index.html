                    <span>I’ve reviewed a lot of video game adaptations as part of my board game coverage for Kotaku. As you’d expect, since this is first and foremost a video game website. Some of those adaptations have been OK, some have been pretty good, but I haven’t played any quite like Company of Heroes before.

                    <span>The good news first: EA’s classic Skate 2 is one of the over 70 games coming to the Xbox Series X/S’s backwards compatibility list. The bad news? It’s going to be missing its online multiplayer shortly afterwards, because EA is turning off the game’s servers next month.

In a dim, empty room, on a small table, lies a cube. Moncage dumps players right into the action with a few quick notes on how to manipulate this multi-faceted object. It tasks you with connecting similar objects found on the box’s different planes by spinning the cube and looking at things from unique perspectives. At first, the challenge seems simple. However, as the game progresses, puzzles grow more sophisticated, and the seemingly unconnected scenes reflected on the cube’s sides begin to weave into a narrative. I only wish that narrative had more substance.
Each side of Moncage’s six-sided cube displays a distinct vignett…</span>

                    <span>But you&#x27;ll just have to wait for an official patch on Switch.
As you might have heard, the rain is out of control in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Not only is it torrential, but it also has some &quot;sorting issues&quot; (as highlighted by Digital Foundry) where things like pools of water are layered in front of rain.
While Switch players will, unfortunately, have to wait for an official patch to be rolled out for the Nintendo Switch version of the game, as reported by Kotaku, modders appear to have come to the rescue on PC, and already making attempts to fix the rain issues (and this is after Rockstar wiped out the existing versions of GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas on the same platform).

Riot Forge and Nintendo&#x27;s Indie World team appear to be uniting to promote a special showcase that&#x27;ll be taking place today.
As you might recall, Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story is out tomorrow on Nintendo Switch - so it&#x27;s expected to be on display. Apart from this, we might see Ruined King: A League of Legends Story. The video below seems to tease what else could be on display:

                    <span>The head of Xbox just wants to deliver a &quot;complete package&quot;.
Bethesda, as you might recall, was officially acquired by Microsoft earlier this year for the sum of $7.5 billion. It&#x27;s naturally raised a lot of concerns about the future of Bethesda games on other platforms, like the Nintendo systems.
While we previously heard how future Bethesda titles would be &quot;where Game Pass exists&quot;, and that &quot;some&quot; new Bethesda titles would likely be exclusive to Xbox and PC, in a new interview with GQ focused on Xbox&#x27;s 20th anniversary, questions have once again popped up about The Elder Scrolls 6&#x27;s possible exclusivity.

Original article : It&#x27;s a rather exciting month for the Nintendo Switch, with a lot of huge releases on the way. We&#x27;ve just shared our review of Shin Megami Tensei V (it&#x27;s excellent, by the way), but if you&#x27;re looking for even more RPG action later this month, you might want to keep an eye out for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.

During the tech test of Halo Infinite that took place this summer, players took to the various maps to get their first taste of 343 Industries&#x27; upcoming free-to-play multiplayer. While many came away impressed by the ways Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer feels true to the series&#x27; renowned roots, nearly as many players were blown away by how impressive the A.I. bots were in battle. 
When firing up the multiplayer starting today, players can reunite with the bots who likely headshotted them into oblivion through The Academy, a mode that serves as an on-ramp for players looking to enter the competitive fires. &quot;Multiplayer is…</span>

                    <span>With winter just on the horizon, this is the last entry in our Fall For Indies series. So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of the year.
A Heaping Serving Of Fall Releases
The last leaves are falling, but there’s no shortage of indies to serve up, as the upcoming feast has many appetizing courses. The Pathless, an action-packed adventure from the creators of Abzû, the brilliant roguelike Death’s Door, an…</span>

                    <span>Xbox surprise announced today that the multiplayer portion of Halo Infinite, which we already knew to be free-to-play, is now live. They revealed this exciting news during today’s Xbox 20th Anniversary stream, where they also revealed even more details about the first season of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer called Heroes of Reach. 
If you’re excited to jump in and battle some fellow Spartans, now’s your chance, but first, you have to actually get into the beta. Here, we’ll break down exactly how to get in:

More specifically, Season 1: Heroes of Reach, which is a season based around the Spartans and characters from Halo: Reach, will last until May of 2022. That means Season 1 is half a year long, which should give players plenty of time to unlock all tiers of the battle pass. According to Xbox, doing so will yield you over 100 rewards.
Season 1: Heroes of Reach officially begins today. All of your Battle Pass progression, Spartan customization, and shop purchases will carry over from the beta to the full release of #HaloInfinite.

                    <span>The first teaser trailer for Microsoft and Xbox’s upcoming Halo TV series has been released and it features just a small snippet of what we can expect in the full show. 
Set to launch on Paramount+ next year, the show follows Master Chief, played by Pablo Schreiber, and Cortana, voiced by Jen Taylor. The teaser itself isn’t anything too wild – it features about what you’d expect from a Halo TV series teaser – but it’s still neat to see Master Chief’s iconic helmet in a live-action format such as this.

You can check it out above – as you can see, it’s short and sweet, featuring a brief glimpse at Schreiber’s Master Chief and the voice of Taylor’s Cortana. 
Elsewhere in the cast, we know that Natascha McElhone, of Californication fame, will be playing Dr. Halsey, the person responsible for turning John 117 into the Master Chief we all know and love today. Little else is known about the show, however, but we’ll learn more sometime next year when Halo hits Paramount+. 
While waiting for that, prepare for what’s next in the world of Halo by checking out Game Informer’s Halo Infinite game hub. There, you’ll find a 4K first look at the game’s opening level, an exclusive reveal of a weapon new to the Halo universe, our thoughts on Halo Infinite after going hands-on with it, and more.

However, unlike previous beta-like technical previews for 343 Industries’ latest go at Halo multiplayer, all progression in the beta carries over to the full launch on December 8.

This news comes by way of IGN, which first reported that someone on Twitter, Waggle_ua, pointed out to EA and Dice that the “Little Green Man” skin available for the Russian specialist, Pyotr “Boris” Gukovsky, is a reference to Russian soldiers secretly sent into Crimea during the Ukrainian Crisis of 2014.

                    <span>The immense benefits of the Xbox-Bethesda acquisition continue to trickle down as new IPs (Starfield) and upcoming chapters in revolutionary franchises (Elder Scrolls VI) are being developed for next-gen technology. At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. 
This exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”
The Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
Do you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive or is that simply wishful thinking? Drop your theories in the comments section below!

                    <span>The famed bounty hunter Boba Fett is coming to Fortnite in just a little over a month. 
This news comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which announced the news as part of Disney Plus Day last week. Perhaps an early Christmas present for those that celebrate the holiday, Boba Fett will be added to Fortnite (presumably as a purchasable skin in the Item Shop) on December 24. 
It’s excellent timing, too, because Disney’s upcoming Disney Plus show about the bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett, launches five days later on December 29. 
Boba Fett will be making his arrival on the Island December 24, 2021 at 7pm ET! #DisneyPlusDay pic.twitter.com/cj9iC6WRBZ

As you can see in the Tweet above, Boba Fett is pictured on a throne with Fennec Shand, who is played by Ming-Na Wen in The Mandalorian, right beside him. It’s unclear if Fennec Shand will be joining the Fortnite roster, and while it would be cool, the actual words that accompany the image in the tweet suggest that just Boba Fett is joining the game. 
Only time will tell for now – you only have to wait about six more weeks to find out. While waiting for that, check out the first trailer from The Book of Boba Fett and then read about how Dark Phoenix from X-Men is being added to Fortnite. Read about how something from Naruto Shippuden is coming to Fortnite soon after that. Then, check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and supervillains in Fortnite.

Over 6 million people played Forza Horizon 5 in its launch week, according to Xbox marketing head and general manager Aaaron Greenberg. 
Greenberg revealed this massive launch week number for Playground Studios&#x27; latest open-world driving game on Twitter and he said the numbers are still growing. This news comes after Xbox head Phil Spencer revealed last week that Horizon 5 had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever, hitting over 4.5 million players on launch day.

Rockstar’s new remastered trilogy of Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, and Vice City, collectively known as Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, is playable once more on PC. It’s also available for purchase again. 
This comes after the PC version of the trilogy was unplayable and not available for purchase beginning November 12 as Rockstar’s launcher, which must be used to play the trilogy on PC, went offline. The launcher (and subsequent ability to play the game and purchase it on PC) was brought back online yesterday. 
Rockstar announced this by way of a tweet yesterday and, in the same tweet, the company says it sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience and that it is “working to improve and update overall performance as we move forward.”

                    <span>Waspn&#x27;t.
Wasps! They&#x27;re a necessary evil in Animal Crossing games, because anyone who&#x27;s been playing for a while knows that there&#x27;s furniture in the trees, so they must shake them. However, there are also wasps, and they don&#x27;t take kindly to being shook.
Not too long ago, it was discovered that party poppers would make the wasps disperse, and even before that, there was just the old-fashioned tactic of &quot;run away&quot;. The problem with both of those is that you don&#x27;t end up catching the wasps, and those suckers sell for 2,500 Bells!

Spoilers for some of the new Animal Crossing items!
Animal Crossing: New Horizons just got a massive update with over 9,000 new items. Now, 9,000 new items is a lot of furniture for the internet to slowly uncover, and yet, we&#x27;ve already noticed a theme: There sure is a lot more creepy stuff than there used to be.

Gyroids are somewhere in-between pets, instruments, and weird little guys that live in your house. But one of their secret features is that they come with a little shelf, so you can put them on the wall... and some people have discovered that they can clip through furniture to create the effect of being in, or on, the furniture in new and exciting ways.
Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the possibilities:

                    <span>Scale vs. scope.

The wider gaming internet is currently in a funk of bitter disappointment due to the launch state of GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, an anniversary package which, unfortunately, isn&#x27;t so definitive. For Nintendo gamers who have waited years to be able to play a fully-3D Grand Theft Auto of any sort, it&#x27;s infinitely sad to see these classics arrive on Switch like this. We&#x27;re not talking about a tiny indie dev struggling to find the time, budget and resources to make ends meet here; Rockstar built an empire on this franchise and has the resources to make something special, something worthy of the &#x27;Definitive Edition&#x27; label. That the studio would release this collection — one that encapsulates such a significant portion of its legacy — in a state anything less than nigh-on perfect is baffling.

                    <span>Nintendo Life gets into ASMR (again).
Ahhh, Animal Crossing: New Horizons. What a lovely, relaxing game that&#x27;s sometimes about spending hours searching for one specific villager on Mystery Islands instead of doing something sensible like cooking lunch.
In the spirit of things, following the new 2.0 update, we&#x27;ve put together this wonderfully tranquil, hour-long video of some calming Animal Crossing views. Watch the fish swim around the aquarium, or appreciate the sounds of waves lapping upon the shore, and imagine yourself enjoying a life of luxury on your very own paradise island.

                    <span>&quot;It&#x27;s not a good version, I cannot stress that enough&quot;.
It&#x27;s fair to say that Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition - from hereon just &#x27;GTA Trilogy&#x27; - has been getting a bit of a pasting online. Though Rockstar is an exceptionally wealthy and successful game company, the remaster of three iconic GTA games has drawn criticism for its art style and performance, and has also been picked apart for seemingly sloppy code - the PC version is currently unavailable for multiple reasons, with one goal being to remove rogue files of content that were supposed to be absent entirely.
It&#x27;s been a mess, and sadly from a Switch perspective it&#x27;s been no different. We slammed the Switch port in our GTA Trilogy review, describing it as &quot;a shockingly rough package&quot;. Yet it&#x27;s understandable that some feel there&#x27;s been a pile on and potentially some exaggeration - is it really that bad?

UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 13th November, revealing that Animal Crossing: New Horizons is Switch&#x27;s best-seller of the week.
Continuing to shine as one of Nintendo Switch&#x27;s evergreen hits, and no doubt helped by the recent launch of the Happy Home Paradise DLC and major 2.0 update, the game managed to sell enough physical copies this week to outperform the newly released Forza Horizon 5.

Nintendo&#x27;s new Switch OLED console is off to a &quot;solid start&quot; according to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, following an impressive launch month which saw Switch regain its position as the best-selling games console in the current US market.
In October, Nintendo sold 711,000 Switch consoles across the US, with 314,000 of those being the OLED model. The Switch family of systems had been the US&#x27; best-selling console for 33 consecutive months up until September 2021, when PS5 went top of the charts for the first time; thanks to the OLED, Nintendo now finds itself back on top.

                    <span>More wet than deep.
Imagine you dragged yourself into a boring marine biology lecture and it turned out to be an awesome rock concert about dolphins. That’s the edutainment promise and it’s more or less what E-Line Media seem to be aiming for with Beyond Blue – but with a cool video game instead of the rock concert. There’s some serious cred borrowed from the BBC, with an “inspired by” name-check for superstar documentary series Blue Planet II. However, Beyond Blue is nowhere near the calibre of that programme. The great power of a game to show and teach has been mostly overlooked in this collection of good but disjointed multimedia assets.
E-Line Media&#x27;s latest is a peaceful, third-person ocean exploration game about conducting scientific research into marine life. More than just a game, the package also includes 16 short educational films of around two minutes each, briefly describing related scientific topics. In line with this academic stance, there is no threat or jeopardy in the gameplay, encouraging ruminative observation of the environment and the creatures in it.

                    <span>Most importantly, the best mode is back.
We&#x27;ll be honest and say that as occasional players of good &#x27;ol Rocket League we&#x27;re a little oblivious to a lot of the seasons and themed events, but since Epic bought the IP that structure has nevertheless made it free-to-play, allowing anyone with a Switch - or pretty much any gaming device - to enjoy the game&#x27;s chaotic multiplayer.
That&#x27;s a good thing, and if you are into the Rocket Pass and its seasons then it&#x27;s a big week, with the game updating on 16th November and the 5th season kicking off on 17th November. The theme revolves around space (and it seems there&#x27;s a bit of lore going on) and brings Grimes on board with the main song for the season. We can see what the developers were going for with a Space theme and a Grimes track but... never mind.

There are quite a few limited edition stores that have found success in the Switch generation, catering to the collector and physical copy enthusiast market.

                    <span>Currently standing at 0.5.
As you&#x27;ve probably heard by now, or perhaps even experienced yourself, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition really isn&#x27;t great. With constant frame rate problems, lots of bugs and glitches, a low resolution and blurry visuals, and some truly awful pop-in that ruins gameplay, the Switch edition is a poor port that really doesn&#x27;t deserve that &#x27;Definitive Edition&#x27; name.
It&#x27;s not just the Switch edition that&#x27;s a mess, though; publisher Rockstar has been flooded with refund requests following poor performance across the board, and fan frustrations have forced the studio to promise future updates that will aim to tackle the problems. If you were thinking of picking it up for yourself, no matter which system you play on, you might want to reconsider for the time being.

                    <span>Full eSmart 2.0 manual shared for our viewing pleasure.
There have been plenty of rare and elusive Nintendo consoles over the past few decades, either released as one-offs or under limited circumstances, and the &#x27;McDonald&#x27;s DS&#x27; is right up there as one of the more quirky system variants.
You might know about it already – McDonald&#x27;s-branded Nintendo DS consoles were sent out to Japanese McDonald&#x27;s branches back in 2010, only ever being shared internally before eventually being returned to Nintendo. Or at least, they should have been returned.

                    <span>...but it can&#x27;t be enabled.
It&#x27;s fair to say that the launch of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition hasn&#x27;t gone according to plan. First, many players took issue with some of the alterations made for the remastered games, then Rockstar was forced to remove the PC version of the game to strip out data files that were left in by accident. To make matters worse, buyers are now clamouring for refunds.
It would seem that there are other files included in the game that might also be removed at some point, as data miners have discovered that the infamous &#x27;Hot Coffee&#x27; code is still in the game – although it&#x27;s worth noting that it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s possible to actually enable it in the Definitive Edition:

                    <span>The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It&#x27;s a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season&#x27;s Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there&#x27;s yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, &quot;This is Frogwares&#x27; world and we&#x27;re all just living in it!&quot; and, &quot;What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;

                    <span>Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he&#x27;d also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don&#x27;t need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don&#x27;t technically need the telegraph machine either, as there&#x27;s an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn&#x27;t half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

                    <span>Last year, Wales Interactive released Maid Of Sker, a first-person survival horror set in a creepy hotel. It&#x27;s your typical kinda horror experience - a singleplayer romp making you solve puzzles and linger in horrible places while trying to avoid spooks. You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you&#x27;ll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

                    <span>Wartales, the next game from Northgard developers Shiro Games, is coming to early access on December 1st. It&#x27;s an open-world RPG set in a plague-ravaged medieval world, where you&#x27;ll lead a pack of mercenaries as you all try to survive. I played the demo this summer, and it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s a simple ye olde setting, no magic or wizards, but also has no main quests to bog you down. You&#x27;re free to follow little story threads as you please, or just exist in the harsh world with your merc pals.

                    <span>&quot;Sometimes a bit of difficulty can add a lot of replayability, but as of right now there are issues and bugs we&#x27;ve encountered in development that are making it far more difficult than intended,&quot; Back 4 Blood developers Turtle Rock Studios have said. The Left 4 Dead-style monster-mashing has become notably more difficult following the big November update, with undesireable consequences, and they laid out plans to remedy it.

It’s actually a big annual sales event that Americans love so much they spend a whole day giving thanks for it. They have shiny buckle hats and go on pilgrimages to the shops. With so many deals flying about on both sides of the Atlantic, some guidance is called for, so I’m here to be your canary in the coalmine of bargains and help you avoid any turkeys.

                    <span>Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn&#x27;t work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they&#x27;re currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year&#x27;s end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

                    <span>After pulling Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition&#x27;s PC edition from sale soon after its Thursday launch, Rockstar returned it to their store overnight. The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn&#x27;t have, which include songs that weren&#x27;t meant to be in the game. Well, it&#x27;s back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

                    <span>Linuxových systémů přibývá, každý den se spouštějí nové servery a někdo se o ně musí starat. To znamená spoustu různých dovedností specifických právě pro linuxové prostředí. Jak to zprovoznit, kudy bezpečně dovnitř, co tam najdeme, jak se o to postaráme a jak to nastavíme nebo rozšíříme.</span>

                    <span>Ze samotného faktu, že došlo k úniku dat, nelze automaticky vyvozovat spáchání přestupku. Tak by se dalo shrnout rozsudku Nejvyššího správního soudu (NSS) v případu úniku osobních údajů ze serverů společnosti Mall.cz v roce 2017. Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů (ÚOOÚ) nemůže udělovat pokuty za úniky dat z firem jen na základě toho, že k úniku došlo. Musí také zkoumat, jestli firma přijala dostatečná opatření k jejich ochraně.</span>

In particular, bad news for Alder Lake that is already seeing the Linux performance trailing Windows 11 seemingly due to the lack of Thread Director integration right now in the kernel and any other missing optimizations around Intel&#x27;s hybrid architecture. A new feature of Linux 5.16 is unfortunately having unintended regressions for Alder Lake with at least the flagship Core i9 12900K. Here are the results from the latest kernel bisecting that uncovered this latest upstream slowdown.</span>

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. After running down Samus&#x27; 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.
Released on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo&#x27;s Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime&#x27;s influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn&#x27;t survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro&#x27;s struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer&#x27;s own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Yesterday, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition disappeared from sale on PC less than 24 hours after launch. At the same time, the Rockstar Games launcher also fell offline - the only place the PC version was available. 

Now, the launcher is back, but the Definitive Edition remains unavaiable to buy or play while Rockstar &quot;remove files unintentionally included in these versions.&quot;

                    <span>I think I&#x27;ve figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I&#x27;ll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and &quot;HD&quot; texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>The writer behind some of the stories and dialogue featured in Assassin’s Creed games like Revelations, Black Flag, and even last year’s Valhalla, Darby McDevitt, has returned to Ubisoft. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that McDevitt is back at the company just seven months after leaving it. In that time, he began working for developer Illogika Games. When he left Ubisoft back in March, McDevitt said he wanted to take on “a new adventure” and it seems he either finished up that adventure or decided he preferred ones where hidden blades are involved.

                    <span>Disney finally pulled the curtain back a bit on its upcoming Disney Plus series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, with a new behind-the-scenes sneak peek, and it teases another duel between the titular character and his old apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. 
Of course, since this series follows the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, we know that old apprentice is Anakin Skywalker no more. He’s Darth Vader now. As far as we know, Obi-Wan hasn’t yet seen Anakin as Vader in between the end of Revenge of the Sith and the start of this series so it seems we’ll get to see them meet for the first time on-screen. 
We’ll also get to see Obi-Wan actor, Ewan McGregor, share the screen with Anakin actor, Hayden Christensen, for the first time in years during this series. Neither of these actors has ma…</span>

                    <span>Disney+ Day happens but once a year, not just to celebrate the anniversary of the streaming service, but to show what viewers can look forward to in the coming months and years. Today&#x27;s announcements had plenty for Marvel fans to look forward to including new shows, continuations of recent favorites, and revivals of long-dormant series.
While there wasn&#x27;t any actual footage shown of any of the following shows, there&#x27;s a lot to be excited for. Shows like Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk are still on track to hit the service. All three have teasers shown here (at the 11:50 mark) if you&#x27;re a Disney+ subscriber. 
Making a surprise reappearance is X-Men &#x27;97, a continuation of the 90&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoon which is slated for release sometime in 2023. I Am Groot is another animated seri…</span>

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 doesn’t officially release until November 19 but select players can get in on the action beforehand via an Early Access launch. The event kicks off today for those who either pre-ordered one of the various special editions or have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, the latter of which grants a 10-hour free trial.

                    <span>In honor of the first anniversary of the launch of PlayStation 5, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan took to the PlayStation Blog to take a look back at the year that was as well as what&#x27;s to come.
Even for a year where it felt like PS5 consoles were hard to find (and still are!), gamers put in plenty of time on the now-current gen device. &quot;PS5 gamers have collectively played more than 4.6 billion hours of gameplay on PS5 and broadcast more than 26 million hours of content,&quot; Ryan boasted. No doubt there&#x27;s been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. 
Fortnite
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
FIFA 21
NBA 2K21
Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Destiny 2
MLB The Show 21
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Demon’s Souls
NBA 2K22
It&#x27;s great to see Miles Morales and Demon&#x27;s Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they&#x27;re day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. 
Jim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.
Despite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it&#x27;s had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find one in the coming months.

                    <span>Now That Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is out in the wild, fans and newcomers are enjoying improved versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. While the games are a blast on their own merits, many fans remember punching in the copious amounts of cheat codes to make each title even more delightfully absurd. Most of these cheats apply to the Definitive Editions and we&#x27;ve gathered all of them here in one place. 
To activate the cheats, simply enter the correct button prompts while in-game. Keep in mind that Rockstar has already warned that an unspecified &quot;couple of cheats&quot; have been removed from The Definitive Editions due to technical reasons. If a code doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s likely the reason. Also, using cheats will lock certain trophies/achievements so be sure…</span>

                    <span>There are movie franchises that will likely never take a break – Halloween, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and despite what Vin Diesel says, probably Fast &amp; Furious, to name a few – and it seems Predator is one of them. 
That’s because a new Predator movie is due out next year, as reported by IndieWire on Twitter. Titled Prey, it’s being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane director, Dan Trachtenberg, and it will stream on Hulu sometime in 2022. It’s unclear based on IndieWire’s wording if the movie is streaming exclusively on Hulu or if it will simply stream on the service and hit theaters next year. 
The new #Predator movie from &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; director Dan Trachtenberg is officially titled #Prey and will stream on Hulu in 2022. The film is set 300 years ago and follows a skilled Comanc…</span>

                    <span>Developer People Can Fly will air its first Outriders Broadcast since the game launched on April 1. The presentation will give fans a peek at a “colossal” free content update hitting the cooperative shooter in the near future.
People Can Fly provides no other hints as to what this update entails. If you’ve enjoyed Outriders and the idea of playing more of it sounds appealing, you’ll need to tune into Square Enix’s Twitch channel this Monday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific/12:00 p.m. Eastern.  
Outriders has been relatively quiet the past few months in terms of major updates. Outside of squashing bugs, stabilizing servers, and tinkering with loot drops, People Can Fly has kept any big expansion plans close to the vest until now. The game has felt a bit forgotten as a result despite earning a 9 out of 10 review score from us at launch. Outriders is an entertaining co-op shooter, especially alongside friends, so we’re excited to see what People Can Fly has in store. 
Outriders is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC. The game is also part of Xbox Game Pass on both console and PC.

                    <span>If you’ve ever lost in a round of Fortnite right at the end and feel the need to scream and implode into fire, good news: there’s a skin now available in Fortnite for you. 
It’s the Dark Phoenix skin, and X-Men fans will recognize her as the Phoenix seen throughout the Dark Phoenix Saga, a run of comics that ran in 1980. You might also recognize Dark Phoenix from the 2019 X-Men movie of the same name. Regardless, if you’re a fan of the more explosive variant of Jean Grey, this skin is for you. 
&quot;I am Fire and Life incarnate! Now and forever - I am Phoenix!&quot;

As you can see in the tweet above, the skin and accompanying items are now available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop. Her set features the outfit, the Phoenix Force back bling, and the Rising Phoenix Emote. You’ll also receive the Wrath of the Phoenix Loading Screen with the set as well, according to Epic Games. 
Dark Phoenix joins other skins recently added to Fortnite such as Jinx from League of Legends, which represents the first time a League of Legends character has appeared in a non-Riot franchise, and Naruto, although this was a collaboration tease and we’re still in the dark about what’s actually coming from the Shippuden series. Be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and Dc superheroes and supervillains in Fornite after that.

                    <span>Update, 11/12/2021, 10:47 a.m. EST:
In a rare moment of financial openness, if you will, Nintendo has released some official numbers regarding its October sales of Switch consoles, Metroid Dread, and more. 
In a new interview with The Washington Post, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser revealed that the company sold 711,000 Switch consoles in the U.S. in October. Of those 711,000, Bowser says 314,000 of them were the recently-released OLED model. He also revealed that many of the Switch units sold were bought by people that already owned one and they were upgrading to the OLED or buying another for someone else. 
On the Metroid Dread front, 854,000 copies were sold in October, and Bowser says this is the best Metroid launch in series history.

                    <span>Dice has revealed its post-launch plans for the first year of Battlefield 2042 and there’s a lot of content on the way for the multiplayer-only title. 
Battlefield 2042 is out now for those with access to its early access period, and the full title will be out for most on November 19. As you jump into the game, you’ll be treated to a sizeable amount of maps, specialists, weapons, and more, but according to a new blog post from Dice, this is just the beginning. In its first year, you can expect multiple seasons and accompanying battle passes, new specialists, and possibly some new maps.

“In our first year of live service, we will deliver four Seasons, with four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content,” Dice’s blog post reads. “We also intend to deliver updates to Battlefield Portal that will give players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.” 
Continuing in the blog, Dice says for Season 1, expect a new Specialist, one Battle Pass, and some additional Portal content. They even tease that players might see some “new sights” (presumably by way of new maps) as the story of 2042 unfolds. More details regarding that will be shared early next year, Dice says. 
“During launch, we’ll also kick off the Preseason with Weekly Missions and Rewards, Limited Time Modes, featured Creator Spotlights and experiences in Battlefield Portal, and more,” the blog post reads.

The Shin Megami series has always reflected the darkness and cruelty of the world we live in, offering a reminder that the odds are often stacked against us, and unfair circumstances can cause great loss. But it also captures the beauty of rising up against those daunting challenges to stand tall – even when things seem impossible, we somehow persevere. That’s what makes the Shin Megami Tensei franchise shine, but the road to these victorious highs is filled with demoralizing lows. Voluntarily putting your energy into something that requires extra fortitude, commitment, and patience may not seem that appetizing at first glance, but no game has made me feel the rush of victor…</span>

                    <span>Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

                    <span>Listen, folks, I&#x27;m going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don&#x27;t get Dark Souls. I&#x27;ve tried to play FromSoftware&#x27;s much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I&#x27;m simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I&#x27;ve come to realise I simply don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to see it through. I&#x27;m not sure I ever will, either. 
It&#x27;s the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I&#x27;ve fallen hook, line and sinker for Death&#x27;s Door, the crow reaper sword &#x27;em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

                    <span>I arrive at this episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang thoroughly shootered. Both big FPS releases of the month, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, have been at my fingertips this week and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts. Of course, Imogen hits us with news too. Valorant has another new character coming out, Fortnite pulls Travis Scott, and Imogen gives us the lowdown on just how much she&#x27;s enjoying Apex Legends&#x27; latest season.

                    <span>Rockstar yesterday launched the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, a collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas rebuilt and remastered. Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

Folks who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions, or subscribe to EA Play Pro, can now hop on and start popping faces in Dice&#x27;s new FPS. Everyone else, hey, be glad that other people are paying to test the game for you so it&#x27;s in better shape later. Though reportedly voice chat won&#x27;t even be in by the time it properly launch so sheesh.

It&#x27;s a developer-focused event, but it&#x27;s free for everyone to watch, so if you&#x27;re interested in hearing some behind-the-scenes details about Valve&#x27;s handheld PC, it might be worth tuning in.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

                    <span>Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

                    <span>Far Cry executive producer, Dan Hay, has announced his departure from Ubisoft after working there for over 10 years. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Hay will officially be gone from the company behind Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, and Tom Clancy’s The Division, tomorrow. Ubisoft told VGC that Hay has not revealed what’s next for him, though.

If you’ve toyed around with the idea of creating a new controller in the Xbox Design Lab but were waiting for some old features to return, now is your time. That’s because Xbox has brought back rubberized grips and metallic finishes. Three new colors are available as well. 
“[We’re] excited to announce that rubberized grips and metallic finishes are returning to Xbox Design Lab with new color customization options, giving you even more combinations to choose from,” Xbox’s blog post about the announcement reads.
Here’s everything added to the lab today:

Nintendo tweeted the surprise announcement today that you can download the app from the Switch eShop. Now you can watch your streamer of choice play Animal Crossing: New Horizons or complain about the Nintendo 64 emulation on the online Expansion Pack. Given the lack of many popular streaming services on the eShop, such as Netflix, the fact that Twitch made the cut is a small miracle.

                    <span>If you preordered a Playdate handheld gaming device that was set to ship this year, you’re going to have to wait a little bit longer. 
Panic Inc. announced today that its first batch of Playdates originally set to ship in 2021 have been delayed to early 2022, citing a “critical battery issue” that was caught late in the process. As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.
“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” 
Panic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. 
For more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn&#x27;t the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch.

                    <span>Ubisoft has revealed the official release date for Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction. 
This news comes by way of Gematsu, which reports that Extraction will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Luna, and Stadia on January 20. Ubisoft has also revealed some more information about the game’s built-in features such as cross-play and more.

“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” 
Extraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms. Gematsu reports that two Buddy Pass tokens will come with each copy of Extraction. These tokens allow you to invite two friend to play it with you for 14 days for free. If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. 
Ubisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. 
Today’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January. While waiting for it to be released, read about how its old name was Rainbow Six Quarantine (you can probably guess why it was changed) and then check out Game Informer’s Rainbow Six Siege review after that.

                    <span>After revealing Spider-Man’s design ahead of his debut in Marvel’s Avengers, we now get our first look at him in action, albeit in cinematic fashion. IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.
For those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival.

Spider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.

Halo Infinite&#x27;s upcoming release marks an exciting time for Xbox fans the world over. The return of Master Chief is shaping up to be an exciting affair and we&#x27;re giving you a quick 4K look at the opening mission from 343&#x27;s latest adventure!
In this clip, we find John-117 fighting off the Banished, a familiar yet new group of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites that have found their way to the Zeta Halo and are wanting to use its power for their gain. This first level of Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, but we find Chief getting back into the conflict, f…</span>

Halo Infinite is a few mere weeks away, but you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to get a new look at campaign gameplay! Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure!
There&#x27;s a ton to unpack here, but we&#x27;re showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today&#x27;s video. Throughout Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign, you&#x27;ll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that&#x27;s saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game&#x27;s most treacherous bosses. There&#x27;s no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you&#x27;ll see in the footage above). 
While you&#x27;re giving the Banished hell, don&#x27;t forget to look around. In today&#x27;s gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game&#x27;s upgrade currency that will enhance Chief&#x27;s equipment, such as the Grappleshot. 
We also get to show off one of the game&#x27;s newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It&#x27;s a Banished weapon that feels like it&#x27;s in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.
This is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343&#x27;s latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more! Thanks for watching, and we hope you enjoy the coverage!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s campaign offers two distinct paths for players; it’s one of the biggest things setting the game apart from its predecessors. As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.
However, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before. After an i…</span>

                    <span>After years of waiting, Halo Infinite is almost here. On December 8, gamers around the world will once again step into the Mjolnir boots of Master Chief and fight their way across a massive Halo ring world. Ahead of the game’s arrival, we’re highlighting Halo Infinite with one of our biggest cover stories in years. We’ve got 20 pages of in-depth detail on Infinite’s campaign and multiplayer, alongside a wealth of interviews with the development team at 343 Industries that brought the game to life.
We checked out the first three hours of the new game, finding out about new weapons, equipment, and upgrades.

                    <span>A Switch port of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced during the Nintendo Direct that aired back in September, and finally, after a little over a month of waiting, it’s available for purchase. 
KOTOR was first released on the original Xbox and PC in 2003, and it was later ported to Mac, iOS, and Android devices by Aspyr Media, the studio now heading the PlayStation 5 and PC remake of the classic RPG. Due to Xbox’s overall backward compatibility support, the original version of KOTOR has been playable on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles. As of today, it’s playable on Switch.

                    <span>Expect a handful of cheats to be missing from Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. 
The GTA franchise is known for a lot of things, including cheats. These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. 
However, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. 
“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” 
USA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.
While waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.

Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an interactive cheesy sci-fi action movie, for better or worse. It boasts incredible – and wonderfully improbable – action sequences propelled by a story that barely qualifies as narrative. Infinite even has a run time that is comparable to some films. Unfortunately, Bright Memory: Infinite burns out before it fades away, peaking early and showing great promise before concluding sooner than expected.

                    <span>Naruto is to the anime community what Fortnite is to gaming – a cultural phenomenon with continuous levels of popularity and success. Naruto’s fluid animation, impressive world-building, and relatable heroes have inspired fans across the globe. At the same time, Fortnite is beloved for its constant content rollouts and unexpected crossovers, with Marvel and DC being primary sources of inspiration. However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together. According to a teaser Tweet, Naruto (Shippuden, to be exact) will ninja run into Fortnite next week. Believe it!

                    <span>Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.

                    <span>If you’re someone looking for a PlayStation 5 in time for the gift-giving season, or even before the end of March, it’s now going to be even harder. 
Buying a PS5 already feels like an arduous task. Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million.

Bloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. 
The PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. 
While waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues.

                    <span>Battlefield has always been the largest, loudest, and most chaotic multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the Texas of video games, and whether you love it or hate it, its bombast cannot be overstated. For better and worse, Battlefield 2042 continues this trend, offering a dizzying amount of on-screen explosions, firefights, and objectives to capture. The game’s 128-player matches and gargantuan maps guarantee dramatic moments – and some of my favorite gaming clips from 2021 – but there’s a thin line separating spectacle and confusion. 
There’s never been a Battlefield game released without Conquest, the signature mode which tasks two opposing teams to capture and defend objective zones across the map. The popular match format is alive and well, but honestly, it’s my least favorite w…</span>

We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m once again back, and I&#x27;m badder than ever! To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

It&#x27;s now due in spring 2022. Pavonis Interactive state the usual reason: they want more time to make it good. Please do! After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

                    <span>Ahead of Skyrim Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch, a developer behind a vital modding tool warned that the release might also break mods for Skyrim Special Edition, badly. Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.

                    <span>One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

                    <span>This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

                    <span>The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is out now, adding a bunch of Creation Club content, like fishing, aquariums and more. Plus, owners of the game&#x27;s Special Edition will get a handful of freebies too. It&#x27;s no Elder Scrolls 6, but hey, fish are nice. So, how many copies of Skyrim will you own after today?

                    <span>If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. &quot;It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character&quot; is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.

                    <span>Tonight, Thunderful hosted a livestream of announcements, including a new SteamWorld game and a release date for The Gunk from SteamWorld&#x27;s creators. They&#x27;ve also put a bunch of their games on sale, including giving classic platformer SteamWorld Dig 2 away for free for the next 24 hours.

                    <span>The Gunk is a third-person action adventure from the makers of SteamWorld, set on a planet covered in a gelatinous goo. You hoover it up. It was announced last year, and we now know it&#x27;ll launch on PC via Xbox Game Pass on December 16th.

                    <span>To hell with raytracing. Nuts to your HDR. And VR, more like Very Rubbish. No, the only future graphics technology which matters is pretty water. One of the few games to understand this is Sea Of Thieves, home to some of the prettiest virtuawater you ever did see, while so many others neglect their duty to show me pretty fake water. So today I&#x27;m delighted to see that the next big World Of Warships update brings a graphics overhaul including pretty new water. It is pretty! Not Sea Of Thieves-grade pretty, but certainly a better use of resources than goggles.

In fact, we first started compiling this list about a year ago, although for reasons that will forever remain a mystery, it&#x27;s taken us until now to actually wrangle it into shape. At long last, here we are.

                    <span>Hello folks. I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

                    <span>Compared to many of the tabletop social deduction games which inspired it, Among Us is fairly straightforward. Goodies, baddies, and that&#x27;s it. Well, last night it took a step towards its roots with the addition of four new roles which can change how you play your character—and how you need to think about other people&#x27;s characters. Say hullo to the Scientist, the Engineer, the Guardian Angel, and the Shapeshifter.

                    <span>There’s this hip-hop track I’m a fan of called Money Dance by Rick Ross. It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there&#x27;s one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend&#x27;s PS5 (that I, err, &#x27;borrowed&#x27;, as sadly Elden Ring&#x27;s closed network test isn&#x27;t available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you&#x27;ll be able to experience everything I&#x27;m about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

You have until Friday to claim your copies of the spin-offs, which converted AssCreed&#x27;s sneak-o-murdering into 2.5D side-scrolling platformers. They told stories of three different assassins in China, India, and Russia across several hundred years, with art styles inspired by their setting. And right now they&#x27;re free.

They plan to bring Weta&#x27;s tools to Unity developers, which is quite an arsenal to offer in the rendering arms race against Unreal Engine.

                    <span>Back in 2016 I spoke to game dev and critic Mattie Brice about making DIY video games for the young audience at Rookie Mag. Brice said, “I just wanna demystify to a lot of people that you don’t need this intense process to make video games.” While tools like Unity and Game Maker 2 have become more user-friendly over the years, the game making tool with the lowest barrier to entry might just remain Twine - the HTML-based text-centric dev tool that is often likened to a way to make electronic choose-your-own-adventure stories. The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

In Forza Horizon 5, this involves buying janky Jeeps. So many Jeeps. Players have figured out that an endless stream of Willys Jeeps give them a cheap way to get big spins on the prizewheel, potentially winning big money and unlocking rare cars. The game is awash with Jeeps.

Do větších strojů ale potřebuje i vyšší výkon, pročež nově pronikají na světlo informace o tom, jak toho chce dosáhnout. Další zvětšování monolitických čipů už není výhodné z hlediska výtěžnosti, takže podobě jako AMD (u Ryzenů / Threadripperů / EPYCů) či Intel (Ponte Vecchio) a další bude slepovat čipy do jednoho celku. TSMC toto pro své partnery umí už dlouho.</span>

While Dragon Keep will cost monies on Steam, it&#x27;s available for free on the Epic Games Store for a week.

                    <span>It has been a long damn year, so I&#x27;d forgotten that people were making a grim Soulslike video game based on Pinocchio. Oh, but they are! And you can see that in the first gameplay trailer for Lies Of P. Some big Bloodborne vibes mixed with a bit of Sekiro, within an edgy murderworld based on the old story. As if anything could be scarier than the bit in the Disney version where the kids get turned into donkeys. But come, watch the trailer.

                    <span>It is a truth universally acknowledged (like the status of single men in possession of large fortunes viz. wanting wives) that moving house is one of the worst things to undertake in adult life. And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it&#x27;s all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

By the time you get off, it’s all blurred into one forgettable experience. How could you emerge shellshocked, when you’ve seen it all before?

                    <span>Playground Games will add sign language interpreters to Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s cinematics, adding to an already long list of accessibility features. The devs are currently working American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) support, which will come to the game sometime soon. They&#x27;ved also detailed a number of accessibility options the game has from launch today, including screen reading, game speed modification and more.

                    <span>You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

I hope you’re not all questioned-out from our 2021 readership survey, because today we’re launching the first dedicated RPS hardware survey: your chance to tell us all about the PC gaming gear you use, how keen you are to upgrade, or if you just don’t care about any of this beep-boop stuff at all.

                    <span>Updated over a long enough timeline, all games seemingly become the same - at least structurally. Deep Rock Galactic got its biggest ever update last week, for example, which adds a battle pass with 100 levels to advance through and new items and cosmetics to unlock. 

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there&#x27;s a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

                    <span>Some players have reported lag in Factorio for years. Lag always seemed fair to me given the sprawling, complex bases you can build in the game, but the latest patch might make things better. Version 1.1.46, released this Saturday, makes several changes which should reduce multiplayer latency.

A new Kickstarter update says that the game has slipped into 2022, while explaining why the development team have been quiet over the past year.

Thankfully, Left 4 Dead creators Turtle Rock have detailed more of the post-launch plans for their new zombie-smashing shooter, laying out the content roadmap for the next few months and into next year. Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

                    <span>The League Of Legends spin-off animated series Arcane started on Neflix this weekend, giving fans a glimpse at Jinx and Vi&#x27;s rather dark beginnings. Over the last week or so, the developers have been celebrating the arrival of the show in other games too, with Jinx-themed Valorant skins and even a crossover with Fortnite. The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new &quot;interactive experiences&quot;, game modes and more.

                    <span>Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

                    <span>If you feel like you might at any point want a copy of Metal Gear Solid 2 on PC, you should probably buy it today. Konami have announced that starting today, they plan to temporarily remove MGS2 (and 3, though that&#x27;s not on PC) from digital stores while they renew licenses for historical footage used in the game. They plan to start selling them again once the licenses are renewed, but that would require Konami successfully accomplishing something, and do you really trust them to do that?

                    <span>Comedian Dara Ó Briain has an old bit where he talks about video games, and the difficulty barrier that games have compared to other kinds of media. &quot;You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game.&quot;
Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;m not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the &quot;difficulty in games&quot; debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can&#x27;t answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

                    <span>With less than three weeks to go before the launch of Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Square Enix announced a two-week delay for the MMORPG&#x27;s fourth expansion. Previously due on the 23rd of November, it&#x27;s now expected on the 7th of December. Sounds like they need more time to work on stability, though game director Naoki Yoshida&#x27;s explanation was a little more dramatic, offering his &quot;sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused to our players and colleagues due to my own shortomings.&quot;

But after 16 years at the company, the studio director wanted to try something new, and is currently working on a free educational game named PowerZ. I spoke to Capron about what this new project will entail, and how it felt to leave Arkane after such a long career there.

In 2020, BioWare revealed they were working on a brand new game in the series, but this year they looked back on the Mass Effect trilogy remasters that came out in May. I thought that was all they had in store until the very end of the day when they tweeted a new teaser poster for the next game, featuring a crater shaped like a giant geth head. Geth! Mass Effect trilogy villains! Get your goggles on, reader, it&#x27;s time to investigate this pic.

                    <span>E4 have dropped the first trailer for their GamesMaster reboot, showing a quick blast showing of competitive gaming, and an orby hologram of a man. GamesMaster was an old TV show in the 90s hosted by Dominik Diamond where they&#x27;d review games, give out tips, and get celebrities to compete in gaming challenges. The reboot seems to have more of that good stuff, and this time around will be hosted by Robert Florence.

But if I can&#x27;t have real lemurs, you can be damn sure I&#x27;m adding some of these fluffy fellas to my virtual enclosures.

Though I do suspect the part of Vanguard many want isn&#x27;t out yet, and they won&#x27;t even pay for: the new Pacific island map coming to CoD: Warzone at a later point.
