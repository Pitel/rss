E3 is returning as a physical event for the first time in four years in 2023, and while it was expected to be a return to form for one of the biggest showcases in the gaming calendar, it seems it could be without the major players.
According to an &quot;exclusive&quot; by IGN, the gaming media outlet has been informed by &quot;multiple knowledgeable sources&quot; Nintendo, Sony and Xbox will not be joining in on the E3 2023 fun, and will also not have a &quot;presence&quot; on the show floor at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

                              <span>Carpenter weighs in on EA&#x27;s latest release on Twitter
Serving as the director and composer for over a dozen horror classics, including Halloween, The Thing, and The Fog, John Carpenter has secured his role as one of the greatest horror filmmakers of all time. Fans of his films might not know that Carpenter is also something of a gamer, having expressed an interest in the Fallout, Horizon, and Borderlands series.
Well, if you missed this detail in the past as I did, now we know that Carpenter is keeping up with the latest horror games, as he took to Twitter (with his aptly-chosen handle @TheHorrorMaster) yesterday to profess his love for EA&#x27;s Dead Space remake -- more specifically, he called it a &quot;great game!&quot; exclamation point included. With so many games trying to imitate cinema, it&#x27;s really cool to know a film legend who sees the legitimacy and artistic value in the interactive medium.
https://twitter.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1619855538589937665
In an interview with AV Club last year, Carpenter also let in on the fact that he wants to make a Dead Space movie. &quot;I could do that,&quot; he said. Not only do I think you could do it, Mr. Carpenter, but I think you&#x27;d knock it out of the park. The cold confined indoor space of the Ishimura would be familiar territory for him, especially after helping to create The Thing&#x27;s setting of an isolated Antarctic research site. I think we&#x27;re due for another claustrophobic space horror flick, and this franchise would be a match made in heaven with Carpenter.
We&#x27;re already in the middle of a flood of gaming adaptations, such as HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us series, Amazon&#x27;s upcoming Fallout series, and a Borderlands movie. Even amidst all these cool projects, I think John Carpenter&#x27;s take on the Dead Space series would put them all to shame.

E3 is set to return to an in-person show this year at the Los Angeles Convention Center. But according to a new report, some major players may not be in attendance for E3 2023.
IGN reports that Nintendo, Sony, and Xbox will not have a presence on the E3 2023 show floor, nor will they be a part of E3 2023. This info comes from multiple knowledgeable sources the outlet has spoken with about the show.
While Sony has been skipping E3 for a while now and Xbox has recently held events offsite and adjacent to E3, this marks three big potential no-shows for the event this year.
Xbox is still planning to host a summer showcase in Los Angeles. Recently, Xbox head Phil Spencer had confirmed to IGN that its event would be placed &quot;at a time where hopeful…</span>

The animated, lively strategy RPG series Disgaea&#x27;s latest entry is coming to the west this fall. NIS America announced today that Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is coming to PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and PS4 in the west this fall.
In this latest entry, the realm of Hinomoto has fallen under the control of a tyrannical force. Fuji, an &quot;empathy-averse warrior gone astray,&quot; and his compatriots will have to band together and take it all back turn-by-turn, square-by-square.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aLlk74apf2Q
A bunch of new features are in store for the latest Disgaea, including a special feature called &quot;Jumbificiation.&quot; This apparently makes characters really, really big. I certainly hope that won&#x27;t affect my nightmares at all.
Additionally, Item Reincarnation looks to add even more reason to grind and upgrade. The A.I. auto-battle function is also seeing an update, which should be great for all those times you don&#x27;t want to issue commands yourself.
A demonic strategy
The Disgaea series has always offered a signature blend of stylized, cartoon-y devils and immense replayability. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless certainly looks to have more of both. The improved auto-battle options especially seem like a boon, given how much of my experience with Disgaea was grinding to make the numbers go up.
This newest Disgaea is already out in Japan, having released on January 26. But it looks like those in the west hopefully won&#x27;t have to wait longer until this fall, and there are special editions on the NIS store for those who really want to celebrate a new entry. It will also have both English and Japanese audio available, for those who like the option.
Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless arrives on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch in the west this fall.

It&#x27;s got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago.

                              <span>The Corsair MP600 Pro is a great high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD, so to get the 1TB model for $155 at Newegg, a reasonable $45 off, is a deal worth writing about. As you&#x27;d hope from a drive of this calibre, this uses more expensive TLC NAND flash and has a DRAM cache, providing noticeably better sustained performance than QLC drives without a DRAM cache.

                              <span>Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.


“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LePiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

                              <span>Microsoft and Sony have been in a months-long back-and-forth over Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition and the issue of Call Of Duty exclusivity, and they’re not done yet. In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision,&quot; but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s not muck about here. Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC. There&#x27;s still much more to Relic Entertainment&#x27;s sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld&#x27;s Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

Hellcard will continue the story of Book Of Demons when it launches into Steam early access on February 16th, but instead of slicing up devil flesh in traditional hack and slash fashion, this time you&#x27;ll be building decks of cards to tackle each dungeon layer as a roguelike.

I’m too slow to decipher any of them myself, but I enjoy seeing a game’s community pick apart foreign symbols to uncover a game’s deep mysteries (Tunic’s musical language was especially fun.) Fortunately for me, players have already deciphered the ‘Indecipherable’ text log in the new Dead Space remake, revealing a poem that potentially hints toward the series’ future. Naturally, spoilers within.

The leak surfaced on Reddit over the weekend, claiming to be from a &quot;very old alpha&quot; build from summer 2020. It&#x27;s an interesting watch, as while the world and robo dinos look like classic Horizon, the characters jumping around fighting them look a lot more stylised than their hyper-detailed mainline counterparts.

                              <span>I spent the past weekend flicking between the Dead Space remake on my PC, and the Dead Space remake on my Steam Deck. It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

But that&#x27;s precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it&#x27;s a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe&#x27;s back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you&#x27;re once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.

                              <span>Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there&#x27;s no word on who&#x27;s attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to &quot;build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film.&quot; This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics&#x27; game is already in production, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

                              <span>The future of fantasy
Remember that big old GeForce NOW leak from 2021? The one that supposedly revealed a list of in-development projects at various AAA studios? I&#x27;ve been thinking about that leak for just over a year now. More specifically, I&#x27;ve been thinking about one title on that list: a remake of Final Fantasy IX.
Recently, another, much less reputable rumor surfaced on 4chan (the thread has since been deleted, but its contents are cataloged on Reddit), suggesting that the Final Fantasy IX remake&#x27;s announcement is imminent. I&#x27;m not sure whether or not I believe that rumor, but it got me pondering the prospect of this FFIX remake again. Do we need a remake of Final Fantasy IX at this point?

                              <span>Supply has increased yet again
Since the PlayStation 5 launched over two years ago, it&#x27;s felt nearly impossible to get your hands on. Websites would sell out in minutes after a restock, and it quickly became something of a status symbol to flaunt on social media, because either you were lucky enough to get one during a drop, or you had enough disposable income to buy one off a scalper. The shortage occurred for a few different reasons, the foremost of which was the strain that the pandemic placed on global supply chains.
After multiple promises that the console would be more readily available, it appears that the shortage has finally come to a close. In an official blog post, Sony Interactive&#x27;s Vice President of Brand, Hardware, and Peripherals Isabella Tomatis thanked fans for their &quot;patience as [Sony] navigated unprecedented demand for the PS5 console amid global challenges.&quot; She then said that anyone who was still looking to get their hands on a PS5 should have a &quot;much easier time finding one at retailers globally.&quot;

Even after promises that they&#x27;d ramp up production by the end of last year for the holidays, Sony still had a tough time keeping the console on shelves in 2022. Of course, they gave us similar assurances even before that. I was fine without a PS5 to call my own for the past few years, but now that there are some next-gen games on the horizon that I&#x27;m actually pumped for, I&#x27;m wanting to get on the bandwagon relatively soon. The ever-popular digital-only version of the PS5 (which is also $100 cheaper than the model that can take disks) is still sold out as of my writing this, but at least there are some options available for purchase right now for players who have patiently waited years for their console.

For about as long as I&#x27;ve been alive, Walt Disney World has been my family&#x27;s go-to vacation destination. We&#x27;ve reliably visited the four-park resort in Florida every couple of years for around two decades. I have a real fondness for the parks. But I&#x27;ve always been a little unsure of EPCOT.
EPCOT, the &quot;Experimental Prototype City of Tomorrow&quot; (named for an intentional community that Walt Disney thought up shortly before his death), is a weird beast. It&#x27;s an edutainment park, which already makes it a harder sell than something like the Magic Kingdom. When you&#x27;re nine years old, the choice between meeting Mickey Mouse and learning about the fuel efficiency of the modern automobile is not a difficult one, even if Test Track is a great ride.

                              <span>This one kind of snuck up on me
As we enter a fairly exciting February gaming lineup, there&#x27;s a few hidden things in there that keep popping up occasionally and reminding me that they exist: Theatrhythm Final Bar Line might be the biggest of those.
It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s going to be a low-impact trailer dump either, as Square Enix has confirmed that &quot;indieszero developers and producer Ichiro Hazama&quot; will be part of the festivities. If you&#x27;re a long-running fan of the series it should be a good time, hopefully filled with insights on the history of the rhythm franchise and Bar Line itself. With a multiplatform release (PS4/Switch), this could be the biggest Theatrhythm game yet.

It sure took its sweet-ass time getting year, but at least Deep Silver&#x27;s death-development monster-masher Dead Island 2 is ensuring that it&#x27;s gonna be gosh-darned sexy on arrival. Dambuster Studios has released several new trailers over the past month, introducing players to the four baseball-bat-swinging maniacs attempting to make a life for themselves against the backdrop of the zombie-ridden Los Angeles — or to use the Dead Island 2 vernacular: &quot;HelL-A&quot;.
Each of the Dead Island 2 Slayers will be equipped with their own skills and abilities, as well as what I&#x27;m assuming will be a serious dose of Poochie-powered focus group cool. They&#x27;ll be running, they&#x27;ll be gunning, they&#x27;ll be whippin&#x27;, and boy howdy you can bet your ass they&#x27;ll be quippin&#x27; — as our team of surviv…</span>

Don&#x27;t Nod Montreal is teasing its next project. A new photo for the upcoming game has been shared on social media, alongside a call for job applicants.
As shared on Twitter, Don&#x27;t Nod Montreal spotlights a screen of its new experience, with the caption, &quot;Does it bring back childhood memories?&quot; The team says it is hiring on this &quot;new narrative game&quot; and lists a link to the Don&#x27;t Nod career site.
https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/1619009898712268800
The project will feature veterans from both Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2, as confirmed by its director Michel Koch. What it might be about is anyone&#x27;s guess. Though from the décor and vibes alone, I feel like a &#x27;90s setting definitely lines up here.
What&#x27;s in store for Don&#x27;t Nod
The team at Don&#x27;t Nod has been working on a few projects since the release of Life is Strange back in 2015. The Montreal subsidiary was established in 2020, with a stated goal of creating &quot;even more ambitious&quot; titles.
Between the follow-up Life is Strange 2 and other projects, like vampire RPG Vampyr and narrative one-offs Tell Me Why and Twin Mirror, Don&#x27;t Nod has been busy. The company also changed its name, going from Dontnod to Don&#x27;t Nod, and had a minority stake investment from Tencent.
Though Life is Strange is now under the wing of another studio, I&#x27;m curious to see what the Don&#x27;t Nod crew are working on next. This image gives off some of the familiar hometown-story vibes that Life is Strange has been known for. But we probably won&#x27;t know much more about it until Don&#x27;t Nod Montreal is ready to fully reveal it.

Capcom has published its most recent financial report, which sees the veteran developer continuing its recent rocket success — Furthermore, the studio is quietly confident that it is on track to deliver a stellar financial year for 2022-2023, potentially one of the biggest in the history of the company.
As translated by VGC, Capcom sold around 29.1 million titles in the nine-month period ending December 2022, which represents an increase of almost five million games on the same period 2021. These numbers were led by successful sales for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which sold 2.75 million copies during this window. The fantasy RPG was followed by continued sales for older releases such as Resident Evil 2 (1.5m), Devil May Cry V (1.45 million), …</span>

                              <span>The &quot;Modern&quot; set
Coming off of a medium-sized bug fix update, Fallout 76 has something new to offer the community this week: a set of decorations.
Dubbed the &quot;Modern Living Bundle,&quot; Prime Gaming subscribers can get a bonus set of items, which are primarily used for creating and maintaining C.A.M.Ps (player-made structures).
Here&#x27;s what you get in the Fallout 76 Prime Gaming Modern Living Bundle:
Modern Home Rug
Modern Home Wallpaper
(5) Carry Weight Booster
(5) Repair Kit
If you&#x27;re wondering how to claim them (and are a fairly new player), Bethesda has instructions: &quot;The Modern Home Rug and Modern Home Wallpaper can be found in the C.A.M.P. menu and does cost some crafting materials to place inside your C.A.M.P Consumable items, including Repair Kits and Carry Weight Boosters, can be found on your Pip-Boy.&quot; It&#x27;s available for all platforms as well (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S). You have until April 26 to redeem the offer: so if you still play Fallout 76, you may as well head here, click &quot;OK&quot; and come back to it eventually.
Can you believe that it&#x27;s been over four years since this game launched? It&#x27;s hard to come to terms with the fact that this didn&#x27;t fizzle out entirely shortly after launch, but at the very least, the Fallout name is still kicking while Bethesda plans their next move. Hopefully it&#x27;ll make a bigger splash than Fallout 4 did.

When SpongeBob SquarePants debuted in 1999, I had just said goodbye to Nicktoons and Nickelodeon as a whole. Arguably, I should have parted with that part of my childhood a few years earlier, but I was a late bloomer. Nevertheless, the misadventures of the little yellow sponge that lived in a pineapple under the sea would fly under my radar for several years. It wasn&#x27;t until my final year of high school that I, bored at home one afternoon, decided to give the show a go during one of its many marathons.
I remember the first episode I saw. It was &quot;Graveyard Shift,&quot; the episode where SpongeBob and Squidward have to work 24-hour shifts at the Krusty Krab. If you&#x27;ve seen it, you know the episode goes for kid-friendly horror and ends with an out-of-left-field cameo f…</span>

The entertainment world is in mourning after hearing the sad news that Annie Wersching, who portrayed the much-loved character of Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us, passed away on Sunday, January 29. She was 45.
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977 and pursued the dramatic arts at an early age, training as an Irish stepdancer throughout her schooling before transitioning to the world of the theater during her college years, eventually earning a BFA in Musical Theater in 1999. Wersching&#x27;s on-screen debut came about in 2002, with an appearance in Star Trek: Enterprise, which would lead to a steady stream of television work, including bit roles in shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Birds of Prey, Frasier, Killer Instinct, Boston Legal, Castle, Runaways,…</span>

                              <span>No sign of the DK Rap, unfortunately
This weekend saw the production company Illumination release a short teaser for its fun-looking Super Mario Bros. Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming&#x27;s most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan&#x27;s performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.
The clip rolls out with footage we&#x27;ve seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin&#x27; ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario&#x27;s solemn &quot;Meow&quot; fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.

I&#x27;d love to think that the &quot;Meow&quot; line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it&#x27;s probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan&#x27;s snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. And, you know what? it&#x27;s really not looking too bad.

                              <span>Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it&#x27;s injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players&#x27; troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite&#x27;s battle royale island with &quot;Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super&quot; on it this morning, alongside tomorrow&#x27;s date. This means we&#x27;ll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn&#x27;t make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here&#x27;s hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There&#x27;s also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…</span>

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar&#x27;s Sanji, Emily Rudd&#x27;s Nami, Godoy&#x27;s Luffy, Jacob Gibson&#x27;s Usopp, and Mackenyu&#x27;s Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew&#x27;s ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven&#x27;t seen Netflix&#x27;s One Piece show in motion so here&#x27;s hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 
While waiting for more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

                              <span>The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching&#x27;s family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU &amp; Naughty Dog family! 💔

Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv&#x27;s depiction of her character in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

                              <span>Sony has released a new PlayStation add called &quot;Live From PS5&quot; that showcases a few of the console&#x27;s biggest titles, both past and upcoming, in a fictional news segment, and among the clips are two shots that we don&#x27;t recognize. And they remind us a lot of Uncharted. 
This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

                              <span>Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario&#x27;s famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday&#x27;s big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we&#x27;ve seen before, before Mario hits a yellow &quot;?&quot; block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it&#x27;s useful in the game, that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case here as Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario&#x27;s reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen&#x27;s character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can&#x27;t wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7.

In anticipation of Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s February update, which will add Encanto&#x27;s Mirabel and Frozen&#x27;s Olaf to the valley, the Gameloft community managers are sharing little glimpses of what else is to come.
The latest tease is part of the upcoming Star Path, which is themed around Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, and will add a new animal companion to the game. Each Star Path has added a new animal companion, like the Halloween Wind-Up Raccoon, and the cute little Christmas fox, and this one is a fancy little silver bunny with a cute hat and a teeny-tiny tuxedo. Very sweet.

                              <span>Sales slide by 76%.
The latest UK charts are in and, as expected, the top ten is headlined by EA&#x27;s recently released Dead Space remake. Meanwhile, Fire Emblem Engage, last week&#x27;s star performer, has tumbled down to seventh place after a 76% drop in sales for the week. Not unexpected, necessarily, but we&#x27;d hoped to see it continue its exceptionally strong debut. Regardless, seventh is nothing to turn our noses at!
Meanwhile, the only other new entry bar Dead Space is Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken, a game that has received decidedly mixed reception from critics and customers alike. The rest of the charts is made up of the usual suspects, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Pokémon Scarlet, so no surprises there. It&#x27;ll be interesting, however, to see how long Pokémon manages to stay in the top ten.

If you thought that the marketing for The Super Mario Bros. Movie had already gone too far, then you ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet. German frozen pizza company Pizzatainment has today announced that it will be collaborating with Nintendo on a range of &#x27;Mario-themed&#x27; pizzas — though the theme seems to be limited to the colour of the boxes (thanks, RTL Today).
There are two different pizzas currently announced for the collaboration: &#x27;Triple-Salami-Explosion&#x27; and &#x27;Quattro Formaggi Deluxe&#x27;. If you&#x27;re thinking to yourself &quot;hmm, that doesn&#x27;t sound like anything to do with Mario,&quot; then you would be correct. It isn&#x27;t. What makes them &#x27;Mario-themed&#x27; is the presence of Mario and co. on the boxes — hardly a prime advertisement for the franchise, but proof that Mario&#x27;s face exists, we suppose.

Years in the making, Trek to Yomi is the vision of indie developer Leonard Menchiari, backed by Polish studio Flying Wild Hog and publisher Devolver Digital. Essentially a side-on slash &#x27;em up, its hook is its spectacular aesthetic: feudal Japan and the samurai code recreated through cinematic camerawork in striking black and white. An homage to vintage Japanese films – most notably those of Akira Kurosawa – Trek to Yomi is a samurai story of revenge and redemption. It dives into the Shinto underworld of Yomi carrying some moral question marks to add a bit of intrigue.
The mood is set in an opening tutorial scene that sees protagonist Hiroki learning sword skills from his master. Suddenly, the master is called away on some serious business and Hiroki sets off in pursuit. What follows is a gorgeous, sweeping run of the camera through Hiroki’s village. Controlling in 3D, as you descend the towering steps from the dojo and follow the road directly down towards to bottom of the screen, the camera dollies backwards along the bustling main street of the village.

                              <span>Across the Spongeverse.
A few years ago, Purple Lamp Studios released SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, a solid revival of a 3D platforming classic from decades past. Sales for that remaster were evidently robust enough to justify development of an all-new sequel, as SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was announced a little over a year later. Built from the ground up for modern hardware, this new release carries on the spirit of the original while integrating many new ideas and designs of its own. Though The Cosmic Shake isn’t exactly a game that reinvents the 3D platforming wheel, it offers an enjoyable and delightful experience that no fan of this nostalgic genre will want to miss.
The Cosmic Shake picks up with SpongeBob and Patrick meeting a mysterious mermaid named Kassandra who offers them a bottle of mermaid tears for them to use as bubble soap. The tears have magical properties and legend has it that they have the ability to grant wishes, but things get out of hand when SpongeBob and Patrick overuse them and tear apart the multiverse. As a result of their mistake, Bikini Bottom has become drenched in cosmic jelly and overrun by strange jelly creatures, while all of SpongeBob and Patrick’s friends have been scattered across the various Wishworlds that opened portals all around town. The two thus set out to repair the damage and collect jelly for Kassandra, who totally doesn’t have ulterior motives.

                              <span>Driven by Monster Hunter and Resident Evil.
Capcom has today released its latest financial report for the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2023. In it, the publisher states that it expects to reach a record 40 million in unit sales by the end of the period, driven in large part by the Monster Hunter and Resident Evil franchises.
The forecast comes after the publisher confirmed it has sold an incredible 29.1 million units during the fiscal year so far, up from 25.8 million the year prior. This is primarily due to the growth of catalog titles, including the remarkably successful launch of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which recently surpassed 5 million units sold.

                              <span>Putting the &quot;fun&quot; in d(f)ungeon.
I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Pokémon Mystery Dungeon recently. Maybe it&#x27;s the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question &quot;What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?&quot; my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.
Either way, that&#x27;s the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn&#x27;t very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.

Ever since its announcement in September&#x27;s Direct Showcase, we have been getting a steady stream of Theatrhythm Final Bar Line information from Square Enix — but we are always hungry for more! Fortunately, it looks like just that will be happening soon, as a Final Bar Line livestream has been announced for today at 9:00pm GMT / 1:00pm PST!
The news was shared via the @FinalFantasy Twitter account and the stream is set to take place on the official Square Enix Twitch channel a little later on. What exactly the livestream will entail is still something of a mystery, though we do know that it will feature content from developers at indieszero as well as words from one of the producers, Ichiro Hazama.

Nintendo&#x27;s next major title, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, is looming in the distance, due for release on the Switch on February 24th, 2023.
We&#x27;ve already been treated to a glimpse at the new copy abilities that will be featured in the game, but if an image posted over on reddit is to be believed, it appears that Kirby&#x27;s revamped classic will be adding a lot more content than we could have possibly hoped for.

If you were around in the late 1990s and happily poured many hours into GoldenEye 007, then you have probably come across the &#x27;Four Bonds&#x27; hoax. This was a theory which stated that it was possible to unlock the face textures for previous Bond actors Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton in the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode after completing a series of near-impossible tasks.
This was, of course, not true (regardless of what Nintendo-working uncles might tell you); although the face textures of these past Bonds did exist in the game&#x27;s ROM in some rudimentary form after initial plans to add the actors were scrapped thanks to some pesky legal worries. While the other Bond models were removed completely, the face textures were instead moved to the &#x27;unused pile&#x27; rather than risk deleting anything else from the game&#x27;s build so close to release.

A new 30-second clip from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie has just been released, and it focused on the character of Donkey Kong, voiced by Seth Rogen.
In the clip, we see Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) drop into an arena filled with &#x27;Question Mark&#x27; boxes. His first tussle with DK ends with him getting a savage beat-down, but Mario then bumps a box and becomes &#x27;Cat Mario&#x27; – only to receive further scorn from Donkey Kong, the character he first faced back in 1981.

                              <span>It had no right!
There is a lot of video game music out there that goes hard. By &quot;goes hard&quot; we mean it slaps. By &quot;it slaps&quot; we mean it&#x27;s a bop. By &quot;it&#x27;s a bop&quot; we mea— forget it. These are tracks that are really good.
In the vast majority of these instances, the tracks match the situation pretty perfectly. A high-stakes moment in the game might be met by tense strings and an ever-rising pitch; action set-pieces might opt for a big brass statement of the main theme to emphasise your heroic movements; chilled-out hubs might provide some lighter tracks on the keys, bringing your pulse down if it&#x27;s generally an intense game or letting you fully relax into the world à la Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

Sports Story wasn&#x27;t in the best state at launch, but fortunately, a few updates have been released since then. We&#x27;re now up to Version 1.0.4 and while it includes the usual fixes and improvements, it&#x27;s also got one other interesting change in it.
Access to the &quot;secret dev room&#x27; has now been blocked. If you haven&#x27;t already seen it, it&#x27;s a section of the game where you go into a hidden area and can talk to the &quot;developers of the video game&quot; about the development environment. Here are the full patch notes for Sports Story Version 1.0.4:

                              <span>Got GoldenEye, bagged Banjo, dare we dream of more?
Looking at the library of N64 games currently available if you&#x27;re a Nintendo Switch Onlne subscriber at the Expansion Pack tier, we now have access to not one, but two of Rareware&#x27;s all-time 64-bit classics in the form of Banjo-Kazooie and, now, GoldenEye 007. Just a handful of years ago this might have seemed like a pipedream, but with Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s appearance in Smash Bros. Ultimate apparently helping to establish a &#x27;relationship&#x27; between Nintendo and Microsoft — the owners of Rare for over 20 years now — having the Twycross developer&#x27;s work appearing once again on a Nintendo platform isn&#x27;t such a strange idea anymore.
There&#x27;s still a suite of games from the developer&#x27;s golden years that could potentially come to Nintendo Switch Online. Most are available on Xbox as part of the sublime Rare Replay package, and some of them, specifically those featuring Nintendo IP, are perhaps more likely to make an appearance on Switch than others.

One game we&#x27;re hoping to see show up on the Switch at some point this year is Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp. The last update for this title was featured in a Nintendo financial report last November - revealing the game&#x27;s release date was still &quot;TBA&quot;.
Now, in the latest development, a thread on Famiboards has apparently highlighted changes to the game&#x27;s eShop web page - with &quot;new NSUID attached&quot;. As explained in the same post, a new NSUID means &quot;pre-orders will be going live at some point in the future&quot;.

Hello folks, welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
For last week&#x27;s brawl, we took a look at one of a handful of Virtual Boy games (and one that many of you had forgotten even existed): Panic Bomber. It wasn&#x27;t a particularly close race for this one, with Japan winning comfortably with 71% of the vote. Well done, Japan!

Entering the Rumble at No. 21 Vega, (Thea Trinidad), arrived bedecked in awesome new gear that represents the former assassin in her spanking new Street Fighter 6 garb, complete with lollipop and pointy mobile, and Raspberry Ripple-style P2 hair color.

The retro-inspired shooter genre is really in high gear. Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.
Dread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.

                              <span>Cutesy platforming legend returns on PS4 and Nintendo Switch
A real Taito gem has been added to the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster has re-released the veteran arcade developers&#x27; ultra-cute, ultra-challenging platform actioner The NewZealand Story, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1988, before swiftly being ported to a wide variety of home computer and console platforms. The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized &quot;NewZealand&quot;, determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.
You can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kdyRIX4q0MY&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Shadowserg
What follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It&#x27;s a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.
The NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito&#x27;s &#x27;80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming&#x27;s most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.
The NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

In a series featuring over 89 playable fighters, there’s no shortage of options for the player to choose from. While the franchise has always been known for stuffing each subsequent title full of characters, usually each with their respective balancing concerns, there are still a decent number of standout figures that most people in the Smash community can probably agree warrant inclusion on any list of must-picks.

The past few years have been rife with some awesome remakes or remasters of some of the best classic games out there, including but not limited to titles like Bioshock, Final Fantasy VII, Dead Space, The Last of Us Part I, and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. While this trend is only heating up with seemingly more and more remakes/remasters released and announced every year, I&#x27;m starting to think about what other classic games I&#x27;d like to see get a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.
This is a bit of a tricky one for me because I didn&#x27;t game as much when I was younger — unless Disney Interactive Studios is willing to revive the 2007 PS2 banger that was High School Musical: Sing It! That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t some classic games that are nostalgic for me,…</span>

A change of the seasons is usually a time for celebration. Whether you’re going from the dead cold of winter to the crisp dew of spring or leaving behind the dog days of summer for the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, the dawn of a coming season can bring with it fresh perspective and rejuvenation. At least, that’s what the changing of seasons is in our world. In SEASON: A letter to the future, seasons don’t necessarily abide by the calendar. People can’t assume they know when a season is going to end, but when it does, far more than just the temperature will change.

I hope that the year has started well for all of you, regardless.
And, as we enter the final weekend of January, I&#x27;m very happy to see you show out for our weekly get-together.

I&#x27;m still in the camp that would rather see them making more games than shuttering development to simply focus on Steam (although they insist otherwise), but at least they&#x27;re constantly making changes to the store that make the game-buying experience more enjoyable. They also make their experimentation process somewhat transparent with Steam Labs, where they &quot;create dozens of experiments around discoverability, video, machine learning, and more.&quot;
The newest experiment on the website is called DLC For You, which is a page that compiles information about the DLC…</span>

The 1997 FPS GoldenEye 007 is considered one of the best influential shooters of all time, especially when it comes to its local co-op mode (I guess technically it had to be local because online play hadn&#x27;t been invented yet). I missed out on the golden age of the James Bond title because I wasn&#x27;t even a year old when it came out, but hearing friends and colleagues recounting the magical months and years that followed its release, I&#x27;m somewhat envious of a time before online gamer rage. Now&#x27;s my chance to live vicariously, though, because Rare announced that GoldenEye 007 is available to play on Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles 26 years after it launched on the Nintendo 64.

A new retelling of Lara Croft&#x27;s tale could be on the way from an interesting angle. According to a new report, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been picked up to work on a Tomb Raider TV series for Amazon.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Waller-Bridge is reportedly attached to write the scripts for the Tomb Raider project. She&#x27;d also be on as executive producer, alongside Ryan Andolina and Amanda Greenblatt. She is not, according to THR&#x27;s report, currently signed on to star in the adaptation.
Waller-Bridge recently renewed a deal with Amazon, which also brought her onto the adaptation of the novel Sign Here by Claudia Lux. She&#x27;s garnered acclaim for her work on the TV series Fleabag, is set to star in the upcoming Indiana Jones film, an…</span>

You know you&#x27;ve got it made when your game is so successful that you get a spin-off — and plenty of the biggest games in the biz have done exactly that, from Musou crossovers and sports-playing alternate universes to rhythm and strategy games. And you know what? They&#x27;re usually pretty dang good.
We&#x27;ve compiled a list of the best of the best — the 8/10s and higher in the spin-off space, which are good for newcomers to the series and old hands alike.

It&#x27;s hard to believe it, but Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a year old today. This Pokémon game took us back to the distant past and completely shook up the formula of what we all expected from a mainline Pokémon entry. And, quite frankly, we want more of what it gave us.
Legends: Arceus sees you get thrown back in time thanks to resident Pokémon god, Arceus, to the Hisui region — which would later become known as the Sinnoh region. The game shoves aside many traditional Pokémon mechanics and introduced various new features, but the hunt to fulfill Arceus&#x27; wishes of &quot;seeing all Pokémon&quot; (this god has the power to give you a phone in the Pokéworld, apparently) is the ultimate goal. This is no longer just about catching and battling — you&#x27;re a full-fledged Pokémon researcher.

Drainus. Whether a ham-fisted portmanteau of Darius and Gradius, or relating to the game’s core mechanic, it’s a silly name any way you look at it. Japan-based developer Team Ladybug, more recently known for the rather good Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, has had the Switch shooting game hardcore waiting eight months since the game’s Steam release, but does it live up to the hype?
Drainus pays homage to many genre classics; a touch of Border Down in its ship functions and styling, a nod to Einhander in the aesthetic of its stage-two train assault, and plenty of Gradius V in its transforming boss phases. The one influence that’s been touted heavily in previews, inexplicably, is Ikaruga, as if it’s the only other title in the genre the mainstream gaming press has ever heard of. While Drainus features a system of absorbing enemy fire that can be returned in a flurry of homing lasers, the execution here has far more in common with Takumi’s Giga Wing than it does Treasure’s puzzle-shmup hybrid, making it a largely erroneous comparison.

Well here we are folks. It&#x27;s the final week of January and we have had our first big Nintendo release of the year. Consider 2023 to be well and truly underway!
This week at Nintendo Life, we got all kinds of excited for the eventual release of GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo Switch Online N64 library and suggested a quick fix for those pesky controls. We also looked ahead to the year, running through the 9 questions we still have about Tears of the Kingdom and breaking down everything coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley in 2023.

You might think &quot;Alice, it seems like you&#x27;re making the time a guy shouted at you and threw jeans on the floor because they were too long for him everyone else&#x27;s problem, do you think you have some lingering resentment?&quot;, and my response is that you&#x27;ve made a really specific assumption there, I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Anyway, if working in retail was like running the shop in Kardboard Kings, then everyone would love it.

                              <span>You know what’s guaranteed to make me laugh every single time? A good visual gag in a cartoon. A little freak reading a newspaper, for instance. A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that&#x27;s jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

                              <span>Ubisoft are working on two new Far Cry games, according to a new report, including the next mainline entry, Far Cry 7, and a standalone multiplayer offshoot from the series. Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

                              <span>It turns out Forspoken has bigger problems than some badly-landing bantz. The PC version absolutely brutalises low-end hardware, an issue compounded by its high yet often unhelpful system requirements, and framerate drops and stuttering remain common even on some of the best graphics cards around. Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

That&#x27;s right, Hayden gets genuinely excited over a couple of his most anticipated FPS games of the year, and I realise that I&#x27;m less &quot;excited&quot; and more &quot;intrigued&quot; by what&#x27;s on offer. The consensus? We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we&#x27;ve started two new things! We&#x27;re breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

It didn&#x27;t quite push me over the &quot;Article Threshold&quot; back then, but having given it a proper go now it&#x27;s out of early access, it&#x27;s time.
You&#x27;re a little spaceship, with a simple but intriguing backstory, who&#x27;s appeared near an inhabited planet. A transmission asks you to repair their defensive shield before &quot;the Deadeye&quot; arrives to genocide them, which, uh, okay I think I know whose side I&#x27;m on here, game.

                              <span>Our Dead Space remake review and the associated excitement has me wanting to check out the sci-fi survival horror again, but not quite enough to pay £50 for a new version of a game I already own. So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable. If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here&#x27;s how to get the original working well on PC.

                              <span>Spooky indie pinball hit Demon’s Tilt passed me by in 2019, so I’m pleased the devs have decided to build on their bumper success with a sci-fi-flavoured sequel. Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Above the Berlin Samurai Museum&#x27;s gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I&#x27;ve come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I&#x27;ve played of the game&#x27;s earliest portions, it&#x27;s Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don&#x27;t expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you&#x27;re a fan or a newcomer, it&#x27;s looking like it&#x27;ll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.

Craig Mazin discussed his hopes for the TV version of The Last Of Us while guesting on an upcoming episode of The Playlist Podcast. Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

                              <span>Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he&#x27;s recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac&#x27;s many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

The post-apocalyptic survival MMO was delayed from March to November this week as it turned out the devs hadn&#x27;t actually got the game trademarked, prompting accusations from within the game’s Discord and Reddit communities that it might not exist at all. Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

I don’t really watch video game shows or streamers. If you want the snarky response, I’d say that I prefer to play games rather than watch them, but that’s not really true. I don’t watch much of anything, regardless of it&#x27;s TV or movies. I’m too busy playing video games.
There’s one exception to this, and that’s GameCenter CX, a Japanese video game show that started in 2003 and still runs today. Something of a precursor to the various skits and shows today, it involves a comedian named Shinya Arino as he tackles a wide variety of retro games. The joy comes from the dramatic focus on his struggles. He has his successes, but even after two decades of hosting the show, he’s really not that great.
I love it because it’s a great way to discover games from Japan. Beyond that is the us…</span>

                              <span>Two new Far Cry projects may be in the cards
It looks like Ubisoft is planning for a hefty amount of Far Cry in the future. New reports indicate Ubisoft is working on the next Far Cry, as well as a standalone multiplayer Far Cry spin-off.
Reports first surfaced at Insider Gaming, saying two Far Cry projects are in the works. One is &quot;presumed to be&quot; a single-player experience, while the other would be a multiplayer title. Insider Gaming&#x27;s report claims these titles were originally one project, and were then split into two separate games early in development.
Kotaku corroborates parts of the report. It&#x27;s also heard that both projects were mentioned in a recent internal Ubisoft update from CEO Yves Guillemot. According to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, this next Far Cry entry will see the series move from the Dunia engine to Snowdrop, the engine powering The Division 2.
According to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, Ubisoft has been trying to make a fully multiplayer Far Cry for years. Attempts were then canceled or morphed into other projects. This would be the first time in the series&#x27; history that it has completely standalone multiplayer, though, rather than a mode packaged into the mainline Far Cry entry. When contacted for comment by Kotaku about the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson said the company doesn&#x27;t comment on rumors and speculation.

A Far Cry from its predecessors
Though a new Far Cry makes complete sense, the multiplayer portion of these reports is interesting. Ubisoft has at least one big live-service game in Rainbow Six: Siege, but Far Cry has usually had multiplayer as a feature, rather than the full focus.
The company has seen some rough waters recently though, between recent comments from its CEO and cancelling a good number of games and pushing pirate sim Skull and Bones back again.

Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet have brought its third 7-Star Tera Raid battle into the game, and with it comes a change of pace. The previous Charizard and Cinderace raids favored Pokemon who could tank Fire-Type hits like a champ, but many of these monsters won’t necessarily excel against Greninja. There is one returning champion, but we’ll get to that later.
As has been tradition with the 7-Star Raids so far, you can only catch one Greninja while the event is live. That said, you can freely grind this raid for higher drop rates of rare items like Ability Patches and Bottle Caps. More importantly, since Greninja will always sport the same moves and Poison Tera-Type, you can repeat a winning strategy as often as your teammates are willing to cooperate. Here’s…</span>

Hi-Fi Rush has a lot going for it. The latest title from The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks is an action-rhythm game that blends the two genres expertly. It was practically made in a lab for me, as someone who&#x27;s very enthusiastic about both rhythm games and Tango Gameworks&#x27; transition into action game design. I love its plucky hero, Chai, and his companions (I have a special fondness for 808, the robot cat that turns into the flying ball thing from Mobile Suit Gundam). I&#x27;m a huge fan of the game&#x27;s flashy comic book art and its early-00s soundtrack.
But you know what I love more than Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s electrifying gameplay? Its humble release. Just hours after the game was announced, it quietly dropped on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. I have long held that certain gam…</span>

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed publisher Ubisoft has at least two new Far Cry experiences coming down the road. One will effectively be Far Cry 7, the next mainline game in the hit first-person shooter series. The other is a standalone multiplayer spin-off and likely the company’s latest attempt to create a live-service money-maker…

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn&#x27;t surprising because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network.

As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it&#x27;s likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

Linux kernel developer discussions fizzled out last year over handling this DOIT functionality for what is described as a CPU vulnerability with recent Intel CPUs.

Meziroční srovnání kvartálů ukazuje, že došlo k velkému propadu prodejů o 18,3 %, což je nejprudší zaznamenaný propad za jedno čtvrtletí a zároveň to stahuje celkové meziroční prodeje o 11,3 %. Za celý loňský rok se prodalo 1,21 miliardy telefonů, což je nejnižší číslo od roku 2013. Ars Technica to označuje za katastrofu pro trh s telefony a jako příčinu uvádí celosvětově rostoucí inflaci a nezaměstnanost.</span>

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has dropped again on Amazon UK, this time to £200 when you buy stock from Amazon EU. That&#x27;s £20 below the next-best price and a fair deal for a strong eight-core 16-thread CPU for gaming and content creation.

                              <span>Amazon US is running a Lightning Deal today that&#x27;s worth knowing about: just $180 for a 27-in 1440p 144Hz gaming monitor from Innocn. This brand is one I&#x27;ve covered before - my colleague John Linneman was impressed with both a portable OLED and a 40-inch ultrawide from the Chinese company - so it&#x27;s definitely worth trying in my view.

                              <span>I am fond of Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a trilogy of cooking games which became increasingly ambitious until the third was about operating a food truck on a post-apocalyptic road trip.

Cook Serve Forever looks more ambitious again. It&#x27;s a new game from the same developers with similar combo-tapping food prep at its core, but set in a new solarpunk city. As of today, there&#x27;s a demo you can play and an early access release date set for April.

Today they launched I Commissioned Some Bunnies, where once again they have commissioned artists to draw pictures with hidden animals to find. Still a big fan of that casual descriptive naming scheme. And yup, the pictures are nice, and the rabbits are hidden, and I&#x27;m happy to have spent £3 on it.

                              <span>Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;, which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie&#x27;s treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: &quot;Wooooaaaah.&quot;
Consider the progress of information. It&#x27;s a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It&#x27;s mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

                              <span>One dev who worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt had a good think about their most useless piece of video game knowledge in response to a Twitter stumper, but still came up with something interesting anyway. Patrick Mills was a quest designer on The Witcher 3 and senior quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077 for CD Projekt RED, and shared a neat bit of trivia about The Witcher 3’s wandering merchants on his own account this week. Mills revealed that the script for these lads would dish out fixes whatever stage you were at in the game.

                              <span>Well. They certainly remade Dead Space. With some small but welcome exceptions, Dead Space is a one-to-one remake of the 2008 original.


Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

I hear it&#x27;s pretty good! It&#x27;s one of the small handful of games Microsoft have confirmed as coming to PC Game Pass in the next fortnight, which also include the JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure fighting game and a return to the subscription service for Darkest Dungeon. Alas, games coming mean games going. Do check out Donut County before it&#x27;s swallowed by the abyss.

                              <span>Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you&#x27;ll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Earlier this week, I reported on the possibility of this new take on Dead Space getting an alternate ending. The Reunion ending was leaked by an achievements list for the remake, but now the Dead Space Twitter account has confirmed that the game does indeed feature a secret ending. That’s not all, either.

Na konci roku 2022 bylo evidováno celkem 1 463 116 domén. Průměrně bylo měsíčně zaregistrováno 17 193 domén, přičemž nejvíce registrací proběhlo v listopadu (23 581) a nejméně pak v červenci (13 199). Na rozdíl od předchozích let byl poprvé v historii zaznamenán propad v počtu domén zabezpečených technologií DNSSEC, který klesl o 1,77 procenta na celkových 844 615; tato skutečnost souvisí především se změnou politiky na straně jednoho z velkých registrátorů.</span>

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…</span>

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us this morning on Twitch at 10 a.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Sega has announced that “The Cleaner” will assist players as one of the game’s many Trooper cards.
The centerpiece mechanic of Ishin, these cards grant special attacks and bonuses thanks to the help of several fan-favorite characters, including the likes of Ichiban Kasuga. Omega’s card, aptly named Essence of the One-Winged Angel after his Final Fantasy-inspired finishing move, can slice foes with a powerful, wide-reaching attack using his angel wing.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</span>

The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry &quot;a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series.&quot; For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

                              <span>During Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio&#x27;s previous games, it&#x27;s a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games&#x27; Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango&#x27;s other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year&#x27;s Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It&#x27;s directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang&#x27;s latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team&#x27;s base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.</span>

Players will encounter Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince last seen in the Dragonborn DLC for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in Necrom.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
&quot;Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you&#x27;ll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox gaming revenue is mostly down across all fronts, but its Game Pass subscriber base still saw growth. 
Microsoft released its second quarter financial results for the 2023 fiscal year yesterday, and it revealed that Xbox gaming revenue declined 13% overall. Xbox content and services, such as first-party software and monetization in third-party games, declined 12%, but Microsoft notes that this decline is up against a &quot;strong prior year comparable.&quot; Given that Xbox&#x27;s 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn&#x27;t surprising.
However, the financial results state that this 12% decline is &quot;partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.&quot; Xbox hardware revenue has also declined 13%. During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Xbox&#x27;s monthly act…</span>

                              <span>Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland&#x27;s resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will &quot;keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life.&quot;

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe &quot;who was in a dating relationship with the defendant.&quot; 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland&#x27;s attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year&#x27;s High On Life.</span>

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games. In terms of who owns the rights to the games, it’s these three companies.”

One of the best non-mechs I&#x27;ve tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it&#x27;s down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

One that doesn&#x27;t feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they&#x27;ve ever been before.

Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It&#x27;s a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there&#x27;s an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it&#x27;s out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

                              <span>The original Pharaoh, released in 1999, was a lot of people&#x27;s first citybuilder. In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I&#x27;m the dad now, and the &quot;full remake&quot; Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

                              <span>A fast-paced game that&#x27;s all about reflecting bullets back with a katana sounds great to me, a known fan of parrying projectiles. I bought new indie game Agent In Depth within 20 seconds of seeing it. Then I played it. Oh no. I feel old. Am I too old? What I can tell you is, if you like fast-paced action platformers with bullets to parry, instadeath to punish you, and no checkpoints to support you, you might enjoy this. It&#x27;s only £2 to find out.

                              <span>Last time, you decided overwhelmingly (94%!) that knocking folks over edges is better than big engines rising from the bonnet. Honestly, I cannot disagree. I adore that giant supercharged engine. I will always pick the cars with that giant supercharged engine. But imagine if someone were standing atop that giant supercharged engine&#x27;s towering intake, and I kicked them off it. Glorious! This week, I must apologise, but circumstances have led us to a choice between two wholly dissimilar things. What&#x27;s better: a pre-boss battle supply cache, or resources too good to use?

                              <span>Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

While the chain’s distinctive rocket doesn’t feature in any of the snaps, all taken by J. Carson in New York state, you can clearly make out the Red Rocket branding on its sign and bright red atomic fuel pumps. The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

Actor Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last Of Us show alongside Pedro Pascal as Joel, told the BBC that she reckons Season 2 is “pretty likely”. Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There&#x27;s nothing confirmed yet so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see,” she said.

                              <span>Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

                              <span>I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there&#x27;s been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix&#x27;s newfound PC love-in would mean I&#x27;d be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn&#x27;t, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that&#x27;s okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII&#x27;s Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

In the latest unusual twist in The Day Before&#x27;s development, Fntastic shared a statement explaining the delay that credits it to a US trademark filing that the company overlooked. Oddly, The Day Before’s store page also seems to have disappeared from Steam within the past day.

Going forward, this is going to be a fortnightly podcast, but we just couldn&#x27;t wait to share our thoughts on this year&#x27;s best upcoming indie games, so we decided to release Episode 2 a week early, as a treat (the treat is for us, really, but we hope you enjoy it too!).

                              <span>Microsoft have reported worldwide technical issues with multiple Microsoft services this morning, including Minecraft, Xbox Live, Teams, Outlook and other 365 products. In a Twitter thread from Microsoft&#x27;s 365 Status account, they said the problems have been caused by “networking configuration issues”, and that a recent network change had been rolled back. It&#x27;s hoped this will solve the access problems people have faced trying to use these services this morning, but lingering issues may still be kicking about.

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.

This model is well-equipped too, with a 12th-gen Core i7 12650H processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD and a 15-in 144Hz display.

I&#x27;m justifying this spurious comparison because the games we picked as our favourites of 2022 have proven a strong indicator of what you&#x27;ll find on this year&#x27;s list of IGF finalists. Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today&#x27;s example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That&#x27;s an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

As of today, you can now give Square Enix&#x27;s Cuff-ing season action-adventure a whiz before you decide whether you want to pay £65/$70 for it.

As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

Players began efforts to alert Rockstar to the issues en masse over the weekend, after some nefarious types took advantage of the issues to disrupt the game for other people. Rockstar Support have tweeted that a security-related update is coming, but didn&#x27;t give a specific timeframe for it yet.

                              <span>Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the &#x27;touch anything and you&#x27;re dead&#x27; bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you&#x27;d also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

                              <span>Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it&#x27;s such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could &quot;live the book&quot;. Don&#x27;t bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we&#x27;d be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they&#x27;re achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t want to live in any of the books he&#x27;s been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in them because you&#x27;d only end up being a side character, and that&#x27;s boring.

                              <span>There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

                              <span>Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you&#x27;re given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it&#x27;s your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn&#x27;t most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you&#x27;re tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you&#x27;ll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they&#x27;re all swept away. 
It&#x27;s certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi&#x27;s undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio&#x27;s debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they&#x27;re tipped in your favour.

                              <span>Mimimi Games have been teasing their next stealth strategy game for over two years now, and finally, we know what it is. Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it&#x27;s all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

                              <span>After almost 14 years, I am still delighted by Windosill. It&#x27;s still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It&#x27;s such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it&#x27;s out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.

                              <span>Even before the monsters arrived, the USG Ishimura was a nightmare. 


I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

                              <span>You may have already heard that several outlets haven&#x27;t had review code for Forspoken, Squeenix&#x27;s magical parkour isekai game that&#x27;s out today and that some people have already decided they hate because of the dialogue. I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don&#x27;t have code, so no PC review from us for a while.
Like many others - and you too, if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 - I&#x27;ve been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl &quot;lemme get this straight?!&quot; credentials. And you know what? I don&#x27;t hate it!

In a leaked email, Globo staff are informed that when people share too much BBB23 content on social media, it hurts the show and the company, and it needs to be stopped. And if staff suspect people of sharing their passwords, they should be reported too.

Z čehož vyplývá, že je potřeba ohlídat si nastavení KDF na straně klienta, protože dostatečně vysoký počet iterací hraje významnou roli ve zpomalení útočníka snažícího se uhádnout hlavní heslo trezoru.</span>

                              <span>Last week, The Last of Us&#x27; premiere scored HBO&#x27;s second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, &quot;Infected,&quot; has broken another HBO record.
&quot;Infected&quot; brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week&#x27;s 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network&#x27;s history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the &quot;largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,&quot; which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>EA Motive&#x27;s remake of Dead Space is out later this week, but if you need your fix of Isaac Clarke now, you can purchase the Strange Transmissions Quest Pack in Fortnite today. 
Isaac Clarke joins Fortnite&#x27;s Gaming Legends Series and he can join your locker roster via the new quest pack for $11.99. Strange Transmissions is available now in the Fortnite Item Shop and it allows you to collect the Issac Clarke Outfit and earn up to 1500 V-Bucks, which is essentially how much the pack costs (if you convert V-Bucks into real-world dollars). The pack also includes the RIG Back Bling, the USG Ishimura Back Bling, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe, and the Bench Upgrade Emote, which is built-in to the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe. 
For more Isaac Clarke, watch this extended Dead Space gameplay walkthrough that runs down the remake&#x27;s new features and then watch this new story trailer for Dead Space ahead of the game&#x27;s release this Friday. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Revealed yesterday during a Thunderful stream, SteamWorld Build is a new city-builder set in the SteamWorld universe due out sometime this year on consoles and PC. In it, your goal is to escape a dying planet and the only way to do this is by building a mining town to dig up &quot;vital long-lost technology.&quot; You&#x27;ll need to manage your city as the needs of it, and the citizens living there, grow, and you&#x27;ll have to defend your creation from the deadly creatures that lurk below. 
Check out the SteamWorld Build announcement trailer below:

Niantic, the studio behind the still-running Pokémon Go, has officially launched its latest project, NBA All-World.

                              <span>Everyone loves Subnautica, the beautiful, terrifying, no-combat underwater survival game. Have as many people also explored the chilly seas of similarly excellent standalone expansion Subnautica: Below Zero? No. So here&#x27;s a chance to fix that: Below Zero is currently 58% off in Steam&#x27;s Base Builder Fest.

                              <span>Since about 2015, there&#x27;s been an Acer monitor of one kind or another on my desk. The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they&#x27;re also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer&#x27;s most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

                              <span>After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven&#x27;t seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one&#x27;s a citybuilder, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s Build that&#x27;s coming out first. 
After all, it&#x27;s been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That&#x27;s right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it&#x27;s a mining and tower defence &#x27;em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it&#x27;s really something special.

                              <span>Thunderful have just unveiled the next game in their excellent SteamWorld series, and it&#x27;s not the one we thought it was going to be. Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It&#x27;s a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it&#x27;s called SteamWorld Build. I&#x27;ve played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s a little bit good. If you just want the facts of what was announced, though, read on below.

HSI affidavits filed in support of the December 2022 domain seizures reveal how that process played out.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR has been delayed. 
PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn&#x27;t an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It&#x27;s a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…</span>

                              <span>Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that &quot;Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.&quot; What&#x27;s your favorite Life Is Strange game?

                              <span>World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.</span>

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She&#x27;s also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

                              <span>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company&#x27;s ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there&#x27;s no official indication that Halo Infinite&#x27;s course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend:

January 21, 2023
It&#x27;s a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

                              <span>WWE 2K23 has been unveiled, and for some strange reason, 2K decided the cover art will feature a blank picture instead of a wrestler. I kid, of course. This year’s cover superstar is the 16-time World Champion and master of implied invisibility, John Cena.


As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE&#x27;s version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena&#x27;s career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back. For the Creation Suite, custom arenas are now playable online, and entrances have more customization opt…</span>

                              <span>Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it&#x27;s been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it&#x27;s clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward&#x27;s tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if &quot;no HUD&quot; is any indication, it&#x27;ll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.
