                    <span>Update 12/03/21 7:19 p.m. Central time: A new report from The Washington Post further details today&#x27;s layoffs at Raven Software. According to the outlet, &quot;at least a dozen&quot; contractors on Raven&#x27;s QA team have been let go. As the outlet points out, that&#x27;s about one-third of the QA department&#x27;s overall testers. More contractors are expected to be told between today, December 3, and next Wednesday, December 8, if they&#x27;re being promoted or laid-off, Washington Post writes. 
According to the report, Activision-Blizzard has ended its staffing partnership with the company Tapfin. It will be expanding its partnership instead with the company Volt. Contractors not affected by today&#x27;s layoffs will now be Volt employees. They will also receive a $1.50 raise, bringing their hourly total up to $18.50 p…</span>

                    <span>After playing around with cards and mechanics exclusive to Magic: The Gathering Arena, Wizards of the Coast is expanding into supporting a new digital-only format called Alchemy. This new format and everything that comes with it will launch on December 9. 
Alchemy is built on the Standard format and its yearly rotation of sets. That means when the time comes for a year&#x27;s worth of cards to drop out of Standard, they will lose legality in Alchemy as well. However, a pool of new, Arena exclusive cards will be added a few weeks after each Standard-legal set launches, meaning we&#x27;ll see new batches of digital cards every few months. Players will find these via Alchemy booster packs or by cashing in wildcards like any other card in Arena. Our first Alchemy infusion will play off of the most recen…</span>

                    <span>343 Industries is preparing for the launch of the Halo Infinite campaign next week, but it’s also kept multiplayer feedback and improvements as one of its top priorities. 
The team recently updated its multiplayer progression system to give players increased XP for the first six matches of any given day in response to calls from the community for battle pass progression to be sped up. Another popular ask from the community involves playlists, or specifically, the lack of dedicated free-for-all and SWAT playlists, amongst others such as a Slayer playlist.

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>Sony is reportedly working on an Xbox Game Pass competitor that will include three tiers of service and essentially see PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now merge. 
This news comes by way of a new Bloomberg report that says the service will be subscription-based, much like Sony&#x27;s current Plus and Now offerings and of course, Xbox Game Pass. The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games.

The subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. 
Bloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. 
While waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup.

                    <span>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, the Naughty Dog-developed platformer that spawned two sequels and multiple spinoffs, is now 20 years old, and to celebrate the anniversary, Sony has rounded up some retrospective thoughts from Naughty Dog devs and other PlayStation studio leads. 
Hitting PlayStation 2 on December 3, 2001, The Precursor Legacy is officially 20 years old, and as noted by Sony Interactive Entertainment content communications manager, Tim Turi, who wrote today’s PlayStation Blog post, it marks an interesting point for Naughty Dog. Today, Naughty Dog is best known for Uncharted and The Last of Us, but before those two franchises, their bread and butter was Jak and Daxter, the series the studio developed after its bout of Crash Bandicoot games.

This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which reports that Hazelight has indeed abandoned its trademark for “It Takes Two,” but remains hopeful as a studio that a resolution will be reached. The publication’s report indicates that Take-Two filed a trademark claim against Hazelight shortly after It Takes Two was released. Records show that Hazelight then abandoned ownership of the name.

                    <span>Developer One-O-One Games and Meta Publishing have pulled the curtain back on Aftermath, a new survival horror game coming next year. Players control an astronaut who returns to Earth after a mission only to find the planet upended by an alien invasion.
After a botched reentry to Earth, protagonist Charlie Gray finds herself alone, emotionally broken, but driven by a singular mission to locate her missing daughter. She’s up against an intimidating extraterrestrial menace, specifically an invisible hunter tracking her every move. Charlie must outwit this foe to survive while also confronting more in-your-face threats such as shambling corpse-like creatures in over-the-shoulder third-person combat. Charlie may not be a soldier, but she is a brilliant engineer, using those skills to concoct blueprints for tools by examining everyday objects. Think of her like a McGyver.

                    <span>A handful of supposed Battlefield 2042 leaks appeared on social media yesterday and, due to their winter holiday theming, some fans were upset. 
New skins are likely a welcome addition to the online FPS, but some fans on the official Battlefield 2042 subreddit voiced their concern that a “Father Winter” skin for one of the specialists was a step too far – fans fear these skins indicate that 2042 will head in the route of Call of Duty: Warzone, which includes skins from Saw, Donnie Darko, and other less-serious cosmetics. The concern amongst fans is that 2042 is a more serious shooter compared to Warzone where skins similar to “Father Winter” might appear. You can see some of the supposed leaked skins below, courtesy of Battlefield Bulletin on Twitter.

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed that Paper Mario is joining the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue next week. 
Revealed on Twitter, the company released a trailer for the Nintendo 64 game, sharing that it will join the Switch’s online games service next week on December 10. However, because it’s an N64 game, not all Online users will have access to it as you must be subscribed to the Expansion Pack version of the service to play it.

“Adventure through the Mushroom Kingdom to save Princess Peach from Bowser’s clutches as a paper-thin version of Mario,” Nintendo’s tweet reads. “Paper Mario unfolds on Nintendo Switch for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members on 12/10.”

                    <span>Animal Breath: Crossing The Wild.
How can we summon news about Breath of the Wild 2? The last thing we heard was a 2022 release window, which is probably going to be more like &quot;end of 2022&quot; than any time soon. Still, rumours are swirling. Would it help to start recreating it in another game, perhaps?
That&#x27;s what a few Animal Crossing: New Horizons players and designers have been doing with the new 2.0 update and all its furniture, which includes much larger décor like the castle wall and the ruined arches, as well as new items that can have interesting applications.

Big Brain Academy: Brain Vs Brain is out today, bringing multiplayer brain-testing to the Nintendo Switch juuuuust in time for Christmas.
But if you&#x27;re imagining a tense and combative situation in which either your children are crying because you&#x27;re (obviously) smarter than them, or your children smugly lording it over you because you let them win and they just assume they won on merit, then fear not: Big Brain Academy has that dilemma all figured out.

We&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun with Happy Home Paradise&#x27;s vacation home designs, and the new depth that the DLC has added to Animal Crossing: New Horizons — but, we have to admit, most of us haven&#x27;t really been getting too gimmicky or adventurous with it.
Maybe that&#x27;s a mistake, since we&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of really neat ideas pop up since the DLC&#x27;s release almost a month ago, including this one from Reddit user u/Fair-Stranger1860:

                    <span>Second time&#x27;s the charm.
Sometimes it takes a few tries for a developer to properly execute their vision for a game. Just look at the original Metroid and then think of how it led to Super Metroid. It’s not that the original was bad, but it was a rudimentary initial take on what Yoshio Sakamoto really had in mind from the beginning. The same sentiment could apply to the BloodRayne series. Whereas the first BloodRayne was a sloppy attempt at doing an early character action game, BloodRayne 2 delivered a much more refined and enjoyable take on the formula. BloodRayne 2 unfortunately still isn’t a great game, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be lauded for the improvements it implemented.
BloodRayne 2 takes place in modern times, so there are no secret Nazi squads to be found. Rather, the narrative is a much more personal tale of revenge. The plot centers around Kagan, Rayne’s vampire father, and the extensive family of bastard dhampir children he’s sired over the decades. This twisted ‘family’ has formed an organization called the Cult of Kagan, which aims to create a dark world where vampires can walk the earth freely. So, Rayne sets out on a quest to not only kill all her half-siblings, but to kill her father and enact revenge for him murdering her human mother. It’s not a terribly in-depth plot, but this story is nonetheless vastly improved from the confused and dull mess of its predecessor, as it features just the right mixture of camp and cool.

Top-down roguelike action game Metal Dogs is coming to Switch next year, but only in Japan, publisher Kadokawa and developer 24Frame have announced.
The game is all about three dogs — Pochi the Shiba Inu, Bell the Doberman, and Bonanza the Bulldog — who live in a post-apocalyptic world in which most of humanity is dead, and monsters rule the world. &quot;Monsters&quot; is a loose definition of your foes, since they include a giant tank called &quot;Rommel Ghost&quot; and an armoured rhino called &quot;Missileceros&quot;. Also, the dogs have guns.

Making everyone here at Nintendo Life feel painfully ancient, today marks the 20th anniversary of Super Smash Bros. Melee&#x27;s release in North America.
Only the second game in the series, following on from the original Super Smash Bros. on N64, Melee would go on to become arguably the most beloved entry in the franchise, long after its eventual sequels came and went. Its North American release came just a couple of weeks after the Japanese launch, with Europe having to wait until the following May.

                    <span>We go hands-on with the Aya Neo 2021 Pro.
Next year, the Switch will be five years old – a fact which makes the continued demand for the console all the more remarkable. Despite being powered by technology that, even back in 2017, could hardly be described as cutting-edge, the hybrid system has shifted over 90 million units worldwide and shows no signs of slowing down as we move into 2022.
Even so, Nintendo is savvy enough to know that continual hardware refreshes are a good way of maintaining momentum, and it has already iterated on the base Switch model twice (three times if you count the version with improved battery life). This year&#x27;s OLED model is perhaps the most significant enhancement, bringing with it a larger, super-bright display, improved audio and superior build quality. However, the one thing that many people were hoping for is absent: more power under the hood. In terms of processing prowess, it&#x27;s essentially the same deal as the 2017 original.

What is it about &quot;noir detective&quot; and &quot;pixel art&quot; that makes them go together so well? Between Backbone, The Darkside Detective, and Unavowed, it&#x27;s getting to be quite a beefy genre-within-a-genre.
Now, to add to that pile, is Lacuna: A &quot;sci-fi noir&quot;, which promises a number of features hoping to improve on a few of the point-and-click genre&#x27;s worst habits. Pixel hunting? Nonsensical puzzle solutions? Being told &quot;X will remember that&quot; and then nothing really happening? Those are all things of the past, says Lacuna, calling these tropes &quot;baggage&quot; and highlighting their platformer movement controls and the ability to turn on outlines for interactable objects.

Mojang have just announced the first patch for Minecraft&#x27;s brand-new 1.18 update, titled &quot;Caves &amp; Cliffs Part II&quot;, which aims to fix a few bugs and issues here and there.
Technical Changes in 1.18.1 Pre-release 1

Fixed an issue that would cause players on low-bandwidth connections to get timeout errors when connecting to a server
World fog now starts further away from the player, to make distant terrain more visible
Instead of applying fog as a spherical volume it is now applied as a cylindrical volume

Bugs fixed in 1.18.1 Pre-release 1

MC-219507 - Beacon&#x27;s power reverts back to previous one on world reload
MC-242729 - Observer activating without any updates nearby, caused by /clone
MC-243216 - Chunk render distance on servers seems shorter than in 1.17.1

The bugs above are fixed for the pre-release version, which is currently only available on PC, but is destined for a live release &quot;at the end of next week&quot; — the 10th of December.

                    <span>Whisper it.
The Legend of Zelda has celebrated its 35th Anniversary this year, with Nintendo releasing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD along with the rather handsome Game &amp; Watch. Interestingly, those releases alone have included two titles that can certainly be described as &#x27;divisive&#x27; — we&#x27;re thinking Skyward Sword&#x27;s arm-waving controls (though the HD release has button options), and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link being that one that hardly anyone&#x27;s beaten. Heck, there are people that say Breath of the Wild is overrated, even if this writer and a fair few others would happily die on a hill arguing in favour of its brilliance.
Zelda is a series that, partly because of the passion and love it fosters, also draws out strong opinions whatever route it follows. Some said Wind Waker was too cartoony, others said Twilight Princess wasn&#x27;t bright enough. Some games are too traditional, or not traditional enough, or they&#x27;re whatever Tri Force Heroes was (which could have been great with a few different design choices, arguably).

Yes, even though granny&#x27;s turned the thermostat to maximum and Dad has the fire going as well, you&#x27;re going to be sat there sweltering in a garish, itchy, woollen nightmare. C´mon, it&#x27;s tradition!
Yes, it&#x27;s Christmastime, but there&#x27;s no need to be afraid. If you have to wear a festive abomination at home or at the office party, why not make it something a little more fun this year? Below we&#x27;ve rounded up the best of gaming-related knitwear – specifically sweaters – available this Christmas that&#x27;ll keep everybody happy.

                    <span>Dhampir squib.
These days, it feels like every other ‘new’ game being released is a remake or a remaster of some old game. There’s value in this, however, as it’s wonderful to have great games that were previously locked to old platforms brought onto modern devices with improvements and additions. But, just because a game is retro, doesn’t mean it needs to be revisited. Some games are best left in the past, and BloodRayne is one of them. While it may have a mildly interesting premise in 2002, BloodRayne ReVamped is a boring, shoddy, and nearly-broken mess of a game that you should definitely avoid.
BloodRayne places you in the role of Rayne, a half-human half-vampire ‘dhampir’ living in the &#x27;30s during the height of the Nazi regime. Hitler has formed a secret organization to investigate how the occult can be utilized to aid the Nazi effort, and this has resulted in Rayne being called in to deal with the problems which that obviously has started to cause. It’s far from a gripping narrative, and it’s not helped at all by the dull, bored performances from the voice cast, but there’s something vaguely alluring to be found in what a schlocky mess the story turns out to be. It’s in that ‘so-bad-it’s-good’ category.

Mario Golf: Super Rush has improved a decent amount since launch courtesy of multiple free updates that have added new characters, courses and modes. An ongoing attraction for those that like to jump in for some quickfire play is the Ranked Match online mode, in which even if you&#x27;re struggling to win you can still gradually level up and claim a new reward each month.
This month&#x27;s prize for reaching A- is Mario when he forgot to pack his golf gear before heading to the course.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; new DLC, Happy Home Paradise, is a delightful addition to the main game that has already been keeping players busy for hours on end. But while designing holiday homes for new villagers is the DLC&#x27;s focus, a particularly strange glitch has been shifting some players&#x27; focus onto... Other things.
Over the past few weeks, players have been reporting a bizarre error where villagers have been loading into the game entirely naked. As Eurogamer reports, it would appear the glitch has been present ever since the DLC&#x27;s launch at the start of November, and only seems to happen inside Happy Home Paradise&#x27;s cafe – one of the island facilities you unlock as you progress through the DLC.

The new update takes the game to Version 1.02 and mostly centres around new camera and display options. The full patch notes can be found below, with thanks to Nintendo Everything for the translation:

There are two further bundle offerings that add in either Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury or Animal Crossing, plus a Switch carry case, for an extra 50 quid.

                    <span>It&#x27;s the launch of a new MMO expansion, and you know what that means: queues. Early access to Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s Endwalker expansion kicked off today and players are reporting hours-long waits, frequent errors and more while trying to join servers.

In a forum post, Endwalker&#x27;s developers say that the game&#x27;s surge in popularity over the past year means that they&#x27;re expecting &quot;a number of logins that is yet to be seen since the launch of FFXIV,&quot; but that the global semiconductor shortage means they can&#x27;t fix the issue.

                    <span>The Last Night was announced at E3 2017 to great excitement, before that excitement was cut short the same day by the re-emergence of pro-Gamergate tweets made by creator Tim Soret in 2014.

The cinematic pixel art platformer has been quiet almost ever since, but rumours began circling this week that it would resurface at the Game Awards later this month. Not so, says Soret. &quot;It will be shown next year, not before,&quot; he told PC Gamer.

As part of the changes, Vince Zampella - co-founder of Respawn, developers of Apex Legends - is now overseeing the Battlefield franchise, and Marcus Lehto (best known for Halo) is building a new studio to create narrative experiences within the series.

                    <span>It’s been a little over 9 months since Fights In Tight Spaces first released on to Steam Early Access, and as of December 2nd, it’s kicked open the door and walked into a full release. It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. 


  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game&#x27;s multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.

                    <span>I hate to caveat a recommendation with “it gets good later” but unfortunately, the first hour of Chorus (despite the title stylisation, promotional materials do not write it out as Chorvs, cowards) is not good. Yet beyond that lacklustre start is a surprisingly tight arcade space fighter wrapped up in a wonderful bundle of pompous space magic.

It&#x27;s a game I have very fond memories of, and publisher Dotemu&#x27;s latest dev diary about the soundtrack for the upcoming remake has cast me right back to those glorious, if rather futile afternoons spent staring at my parent&#x27;s living room computer. Musician Louis Godart is recreating the original game&#x27;s music from scratch for Pharaoh: A New Era, but he&#x27;s also adding some authentic touches of his own to help do those classic tunes justice.

                    <span>If you weren’t satisfied with only three DLC packs to play with in the hybrid metroidvania roguelike Dead Cells, don’t worry. The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.
The Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It&#x27;s described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.

                    <span>Neon Giant&#x27;s first DLC update for The Ascent is out now. They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.


That&#x27;s pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. 


The patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.

Techland&#x27;s most recent episode of its video series Dying 2 Know shows off 15 minutes of gameplay and has an extra surprise at the end, which will be spoiled here, I guess. It&#x27;s free games!
Senior producer Kornel Jaskuła sets up the footage (at the 4:36 mark in the video above), which starts with protagonist Aiden Caldwell and his associate Lowain, played by Rosario Dawson, celebrating The City&#x27;s power roaring back to life before suddenly shutting back down. From there, you&#x27;ll see plenty of what I&#x27;m now calling &quot;the Five P&#x27;s of Dying Light 2 Stay Human&quot;: Parkour, Paragliding, Politicking, Powering structures, and Popping zombies in the mouth with a lethal weapon ... It&#x27;s not a perfect mnemonic. It covers a mission titled &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; that shows off plenty of traversal, fighting, NPC interactions, and how your choices affect The City, its residents, and Aiden&#x27;s relationships.
At the tail end of the broadcast, it&#x27;s announced that Techland is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and it&#x27;s the one giving out the gifts! Starting today on GOG, you can pick up a $0.00 copy of 2001&#x27;s Crime Cities, and next week Steam will be harboring a complimentary copy of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to add to your library.

                    <span>The Stanley Parable is as unique and humorous today as when it launched way back in 2013. However, during the 2018 Game Awards, fans were treated to the announcement that an expanded version of the game, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, would arrive in 2019. It&#x27;s now 2021, though developers Davey Wreden and Crows Crows Crows have always been the first to admit that window may have been wishful thinking. But after three years and a few sassy trailer updates, the game appears to be ready to ship – for real this time (hopefully).
Crow Crows Crows announced on Twitter that The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is now content complete and is prepping to release it to consoles and PC in early 2022. This marks the first time the game will be available on consoles, though there’s still no mention of specific platforms. The game’s website only states the intention to release it to all platforms, basically.

For those who missed the boat in 2013, you may be asking, “what exactly is The Stanley Parable?”. Good question, and unfortunately, it’s one of those games that’s best experienced as blindly as possible. But if you really need to know what you’re playing before committing cash to it (fair), you can read our review of the original game here.
Are you a Stanley Parable fan looking to revisit the experience with Ultra Deluxe? Are you diving in for the first time to see what the fuss has been all these years? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Quake, which was re-released for modern consoles and PC back in August, is receiving even more love from the devs at Bethesda and Wolfenstein developer Machine Games with a new mode and content added with Update 2.
Out today on all platforms, Update 2 brings a host of big fixes, but most importantly, an entirely new Horde Mode. Developed by the team at Machine Games, Quakes Horde Mode pits teams of 1-4 local or online players (or bots!) against swarms of AI enemies on four brand new horde maps. Every third wave of baddies will include a boss which coughs up a silver key which can be cashed in to collect more weapons and items, bolstering your arsenal for further battles.

Also included in Update 2 is an add-on called Honey where you&#x27;ll &quot;delve deep into the darkness to conquer a deadly plague infecting the land.&quot; It&#x27;s a new Quake experience authored by senior level designer Christian Grawer from Machine Games.
Quake is making its Epic Games Store debut today, as well. Pick it up there if EGS is your PC game launcher of choice. You can find the full contents of Update 2 here.

                    <span>Moss is one of the better received PlayStation VR games, and Moss: Book II continues the adventure of Quill next spring. A new trailer gives a sneak peek at the journey that lies ahead for our diminutive heroine. 
Quill has hatched a plan to bring down the Arcane’s violent rule, but she’s being hunted by a winged foe. As she explores the castle that held her uncle Argus captive in the first game, she’ll encounter friends new and old while also solving devious puzzles and cutting down obstacles with her trusty sword.

                    <span>Platformers used to be a dominant gaming genre, but today they often feel like a relic of a bygone era. Even so, 2021 has seen the release of several stellar platformers. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge your hand-eye coordination and jumping skills, then look no further than this list. The following games all share common elements but carve a unique path in the genre. Listed in no particular order, here are 10 incredible platformers that you shouldn’t miss.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 had quite the rocky start when it launched just a few weeks ago, mainly regarding bugs that plagued the experience for many players. Recent updates, such as Update 3, which was revealed yesterday, indicate that EA is committed to improving the 2042 experience. Now, new shake-ups at the company provide further evidence that EA is doubling down on Battlefield as a core franchise. 
In a new report by GameSpot, these shake-ups and changes are detailed, including news that Respawn Entertainment lead Vince Zampella, the person currently in charge of Apex Legends and other studio projects, is now the head of Battlefield. In this new position, Zampella will manage both his Respawn projects and serve as the overall boss of Battlefield.

                    <span>The new expansion for Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, Fatesworn, will be released this month. 
More specifically, Fatesworn will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 14, and it will be available for $19.99. Oddly enough, despite Amalur being available on the Switch, THQ Nordic’s press release about today’s Fatesworn news doesn’t mention the Switch when it comes to platforms for the expansion.

“This year on December 14, the journey of the Fateless One continues,” THQ Nordic’s press release reads. “After the Crystal War has been fought and Gadlow has been defeated, the people of Amalur were hoping for peace to return to their lands. And although peace has indeed come to Amalur, rumors of a new threat are starting to spread, rising in the far west, the icy lands of Mithros. None other than Telogrus, the God of Chaos himself has awoken and is gathering followers to throw the whole world into chaos.” 
THQ Nordic says Fatesworn adds a whole new storyline to Amalur, a new environment to explore, multiple new quests and missions, new Chaos Realm dungeons, extra gameplay mechanics, more weapons and armor, never-before-seen enemies, and more. It will also raise the level cap of Amalur to 50 and it features a new soundtrack by composer Grant Kirkhope.
You must own the base Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning in order to purchase and play Fatesworn, which will be out on December 14. Perhaps more interesting than the content of Fatesworn is the fact that it’s an expansion for a game that came out 10 years ago. That’s quite unheard of in games, especially single-player ones. For more about the game, check out the Game Informer Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning hub.

I&#x27;ll be joined today by Alex Van Aken, Wesley LeBlanc, and returning guest Jesse Vitelli (Prima Games) to duke it out in Team Slayer, Capture the Flag, and hopefully a little Oddball. 
Many rockets will be fired! Grenades will also be thrown! We&#x27;re hoping a few of them hit their targets. Knowing this crew, they definitely will. At 2 p.m. CT, the Game Informer crew is suiting up for our third round of Halo Infinite multiplayer, and you can watch the mayhem unfold exclusively on Twitch.

                    <span>Cyberpunk 2077 might not be at the forefront of games news like it was almost a year ago, but it’s still making waves as players await 2022’s next-gen overhaul and expansion content. CD Projekt Red’s futuristic adventure was even nominated in the Best RPG category at this year’s Game Awards show. So, what’s next? More merch, of course.

                    <span>Since the reveal of The Foundation, a character critical to Fortnite Chapter 2’s ongoing overarching narrative, fans have speculated on who it might be. The number one theory links The Foundation to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and for good reason – the character’s armor features a design that matches up nicely with Johnson’s tattoos. 
We were all but confident that Johnson was The Foundation, but the actor’s new Twitter video today seems to finally confirm the role. Oddly enough, it comes by way of a ZOA energy drink ad in which Johnson is seen talking about ZOA while using words that match up with Fortnite – zero point, higher ground, foundation, and the universe, to name a few.

Then, as you can see above, he reaches into a fridge to grab a ZOA, and lo and behold, The Foundation’s helmet is sitting there. Of course, Johnson ignores it – cheeky – but then he returns right to using some Fortnite-centric words again. The tweet that accompanies his video also says “#ifyouknowyouknow” with a robotic arm beside it, so...uhh yeah, Johnson is The Foundation – we smell what you’re cooking. 
The timing of this reveal is curious, too – Fortnite Chapter 3 is right around the corner. Perhaps The Foundation is primed to take on a more significant role in the battle royale’s story. Maybe we’ll hear Johnson’s voice as The Foundation in Chapter 3. Only time will tell for now. 
While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer that shows Fortnite Chapter 2 is coming to an end before Chapter 3 launches sometime soon. Check out Game Informer’s Fornite review after that, and then give Game Informer’s list of all Marvel and DC characters in Fortnite a look.

Rei awakens, dazed and confused within the Ultravoid. She’s a voidrunner, meaning she explores black holes with the help of advanced technology. Unfortunately, the Ultravoid is an exceptionally massive black hole with Rei’s home planet ensnared in its vacuum. Time is of the essence; Rei was sent into the Void as part of a team to activate the Starseed, a device designed to collapse the black hole and save her planet. But her allies have vanished, and the Ultravoid has native defenses in the form of ink-like monsters. With dire stakes and Hail Mary solutions, Rei’s solo mission is worth seeing t…</span>

                    <span>With the release of Sora back in October, the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster was finally complete, and now, the game’s balance tuning is also complete after a new update that’s now live. 
First reported by Kotaku, Nintendo revealed on Twitter that the latest Ultimate balance update, Ver. 13.0.1 has been distributed and will be “the last update related to the balance adjustments of the game.” However, Nintendo said that other updates might happen to fix problems related to Ultimate. Director Masahiro Sakura also used this update to give thanks to everyone involved. 
バランス調整もこれで完了です。調整関係者各位、おつかれさまでした。

“Balance adjustment is now complete,” Sakurai writes on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone involved in the coordination. The fighters used in the top-ranked battles and the average online win rate are all different, so I think this is a generally desirable distribution.” 
The actual update features nearly 60 changes to character moves, spanning 24 different fighters. There are damage increases, speed boosts, animation length changes, and much more. You can check out the full update patch notes here. As noted by Kotaku, there are quite a handful of buffs – more buffs than nerfs, even – so many of your favorite fighters are probably feeling a touch stronger than usual. 
For more about Ultimate, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate review and then read about how Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global for new Ultimate and Melee tournaments.

One player, in particular, named “Sakana,” posted a ridiculous clip (seen below) to Twitter, showcasing the stopping power of one of the franchise’s most popular rifles. With one sniper bullet, 23 players are eliminated in mere seconds.

Impressive, right? Sure, Sakana got a bunch of buddies to stand single-file, but the results are still cool as hell. Watching the kill-points increase and the red-hued damage indicator flash per each downed Spartan is pretty satisfying. The only highlight that could top this would be if 23 players somehow lined up inadvertently in the middle of a standard multiplayer match. Let’s see how many people load into big team battles in the hopes of achieving this legendary feat. Trust me, you’re more likely to get a 23-player killing spree by playing the game mode normally. 
This isn’t the only wild thing that people have done in Halo Infinite. We’ve seen players grapple the vehicle bumpers as if wakeboarding … but without the board. We’ve learned that Spartans can lob fusion coils with NFL-level arm strength. The list goes on and on and will likely extend to Infinite’s single-player mode when it releases on December 8 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. 
If you’re a Halo fanatic like we are, be sure to enter the Swarovski sweepstakes for this crystallized Master Chief helmet and energy sword. And if you’re not an Xbox Games Pass member, then you’re missing out as Ultimate subscribers are slated to get access to monthly multiplayer bonuses.  Those’ll go nicely with the extra six-match XP that 343 Industries implemented in its latest Halo update. 
That 23-player killing spree was nuts, right? Let us know what other zany stunts you’ve seen in the latest Halo installment!</span>

                    <span>As much as I enjoy your Call Of Dutys and Valorants, I just don’t think any multiplayer shooter will eclipse Gears Of War. For me, at least, it comes down to movement. The way the beefy boys slide into cover and bounce off it with ease. The side-steps and strafes in those tight-knit shotgun battles.
Recently, I wondered if there was more to my connection with Gears and its lovely movement. And then it struck me: badminton. Yes, the racquet sport I’ve played for 19 years and consider an immensely important aspect of my life. Turns out they have quite a lot in common, actually.

                    <span>The release of the new live-action Cowboy Bebop reminded me just how much I love the show, and how hard it is to find anything remotely like it.

It’s rare to see something with the same tone, because of how many things compose its DNA.

                    <span>Let me start out by immediately apologising to our podcast editor Alix for the fact that this best cars in games episode of The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast does not mention the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV. Mea culpa. But that glaring mistake aside, we do have a bit of a chat about Forza Horizon 5, and other good cars in games and car games in general. I balance out not talking about the Regalia by not mentioning any vehicles from the Mass Effect games.
We also have a very good Cyberpunk-themed Cavern Of Lies courtesy of Matthew, who has no updates on his Olympic feud this week, but does reaveal (during a long digression about whether or not we, personally, can drive) that it took him nine goes to pass his driving test. Nine honestly seems a bit excessive.

                    <span>If you fancy some cyberpunk ninja action to spice up your new year, Ghostrunner is getting a new DLC on January 27th. Project_Hel will let players take control of Hel, one of the game&#x27;s original bosses, as she heads out on her own quest. I hope it&#x27;s evil. I like seeing what antagonists get up to in their free time.

To celebrate Halo Infinite&#x27;s release, as well as Halo&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Xbox have collaborated with Swarovski to make the Halo-themed crystals that fans can win via a sweepstakes or charity campaign. You can&#x27;t buy them. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d want to? They look very expensive.

                    <span>It’s the last day of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit 2021, and it saved the biggest announcement for the end. The company has developed a suite of new technologies designed specifically for the mobile gaming space, called the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform. On top of this, it has teamed up with Razer to create a handheld dev kit powered by the new chipset in the hopes that developers will produce tailor-made experiences for the device.
What does that mean? The Steam Deck might have some handheld competition before long, as Qualcomm is aspiring to jump into the market with this Android-based product.

                    <span>Halo marketing is pretty much always top-notch, and the marketing campaign behind Halo Infinite is no different. Just yesterday, 343 released a new (and very hype) Halo Infinite campaign trailer, and today, Swarovski – yes, the famed crystal maker – revealed two new Halo Infinite-inspired crystal figurines. 
As part of its Swarovski x Halo Collectibles collection, the company has created a crystal Master Chief Helmet, complete with a yellow-tinted visor, and a crystal Energy Sword, as reported by GameSpot. You can check out both below:

“In celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary and the launch of Halo Infinite, Xbox and Swarovski step into the epic sci-fi universe with two collectible crystal figurines,” Swarovski’s website reads. “A unique collaboration for both brands that serves as a reminder of what self-discovery and imagination can do. Created in an extremely limited-edition run, only the bold will reap their rewards. Enter your information below for a chance to win one of 117 [we see what you did there] Swarovski x Halo collectibles.” 
As mentioned above, Swarovski is not selling these (we don’t even want to know what the price tag would be), and the only way to get your hands on one of 117 of these crystal figures is to enter the company’s drawing. You can register for that on the Swarovski site. 
While waiting to see if you win one of these crystal figurines, read about how Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses starting next week and then read about how a new change in multiplayer makes it so that players earn increased XP for the first six matches played on any given day. Check out the best Halo Infinite multiplayer tips we’ve learned from watching TikToks after that.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 launched just a few weeks ago, and if the conversation surrounding it can be summarized by one word, that word is “bugs.” 
Game Informer’s own reviewer said 2042 is “an otherwise solid online shooter bogged down by an abundance of bugs,” and that’s a sentiment echoed across the entire battlefield discourse. To EA and DICE’s credit, though, the team behind the game has been open about the things it needs to fix, and Update 3, which hits the game tomorrow, is another example of that.

                    <span>Respawn Entertainment has announced that its first game, 2014’s multiplayer-only Titanfall, has been delisted from storefronts and will remain delisted for good. 
This means that anyone who doesn’t own Titanfall digitally will now not be able to as it’s no longer available for purchase on digital storefronts. However, you could still technically find a physical copy and own it that way. Titanfall will also be removed from subscription services on March 1, 2022, which means it’ll be taken off Xbox Game Pass and EA Play that day. 
Fortunately for those that do already own it, Respawn says it’s keeping servers live so actually playing it is still possible for the foreseeable future. 
studio’s official announcement on Twitter reads. “It’s a game that showcased the ambitions of the studio when it was first released more than 7 years ago and it continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games.

We’ve made the decision to discontinue new sales of the original Titanfall game starting today and we’ll be removing the game from subscription services on March 1, 2022. We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing and those who own the game and are looking to drop into a match. 

Rest assured, Titanfall is core to Respawn’s DNA and this incredible universe will continue. Today in Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends, and in the future. This franchise is a north star for the caliber of experiences we will continue to create here at Respawn. Thank you from the entire Respawn team.”

                    <span>Solar Ash is due out tomorrow, December 2, on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and what better way to build the hype than with a new launch trailer. 
Heart Machine just released the launch trailer for Solar Ash today and if you’ve been keeping up with this game since its announcement back in 2020, then you already know this trailer features beautiful art and sound, and of course, extremely memorable locales. These locations not only feature stunning imagery in art but massive colossus-like creatures that fill the space and provide on-the-go platforms for Solar Ash’s main protagonist, Rei.

As you can see in the trailer above, a spooky narrator warns that “you can’t save anyone, even yourself,” in an ominous voice that&#x27;s present throughout. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Solar Ash, it’s the latest game from Heart Machine, the developer behind Hyper Light Drifter. It’s being published by Annapurna Interactive, which often means you’re in for a treat of a game. In it, you control Rei, a spacefaring spelunker who explores alien planets for resources, artifacts, and more while traversing environments through rollerskating-like mechanics. Rei’s world then becomes threatened by a massive black hole known as the Ultra Void (which you can see in the trailer) which she must make her way through it in order to save all that she knows. 
Solar Ash was originally due out October 26, but it was delayed to December 2 to give Heart Machine more time to polish the game and squash bugs. While waiting for tomorrow, check out Game Informer’s interview with some of the Solar Ash developers and then watch this trailer first shown during E3 2021.

                    <span>PlayStation has announced the December lineup for PlayStation Plus, and as usual, it includes a PlayStation 5 game and two PlayStation 4 games. 
The three titles up for grabs this month are Godfall: Challenger Edition, which is available as both a PS5 and PS4 game, and Lego DC Super-Villains and Mortal Shell, both of which are PS4 games. However, both Lego DC Super-Villains and Mortal Shell will be playable on PS5 thanks to backward compatibility. 
Last month, the PlayStation Plus lineup consisted of six games: Knockout City, Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, First Class Trouble, The Persistence, The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, and Until You Fall. The latter three are PSVR titles, and they’re still available alongside this month’s new PlayStation Plus lineup, and they’ll remain availab…</span>

                    <span>A new bill introduced to Congress could automatically ban bots often used by resellers to buy consoles such as the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the bill, dubbed the &quot;Stopping Grinch Bots Act,&quot; was introduced by Representative Paul Tonko, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator Majority Leader Charles Schumer, and Senator Ben Ray Luján. In a statement about the recently-introduced bill, Tonko said that &quot;Grinch bots&quot; are forcing Americans to pay exorbitant prices for gifts this holiday season.

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s multiplayer has been out for a couple of weeks now, and besides some issues with battle pass progression, it’s been widely received as a great comeback for the series. Starting next week, it’s going to get even better for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. 
That’s because Microsoft has announced that Ultimate members will get monthly multiplayer bonuses. The first bundle will go live on December 8.

“It’s an awesome time for Perks because we’re excited to reveal that Ultimate members will be locked in to get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses, starting with your first bundle on December 8,” an Xbox Wire blog post announcing this month’s upcoming Game Pass additions reads. “Don’t forget to claim this and more in the Perks gallery on your Xbox console, Xbox App on Windows PC, and Xbox Game Pass mobile app.” 
This month’s bonus is the “Pass Tense” MA40 AR Bundle, and it comes with an exclusive “Pass Tense” MA40 Assault Rifle coating, as the bundle’s name would suggest, along with four 2XP Boosts and four Challenge Swaps. You can check out the bundle above, which includes a look at the new AR coating. 
While waiting for this bundle to go live next week, check out this post detailing everything available in the Halo Infinite multiplayer shop this week. Then read about how 343 Industries has updated multiplayer progression to give players increased XP in the first six matches of a given day. This new bundle goes live the same day Halo Infinite’s campaign launches, and to get prepared for that, check out this recently-released Halo Infinite campaign trailer.

                    <span>I loved The Forest. My small team of survivors committed a little under forty hours building fortifications around the crash zone, scouring for food and rare weapons in sprawling underground caverns, and keeping cannibals and, later, grotesque mutants at bay. The sequel, Sons of the Forest, got two trailers earlier this year, highlighting a newfound emphasis on storytelling. An unnamed NPC – specifically, a nonvolatile mutant – is slated to be the player’s companion. But beyond montages and short action sequences, previous Sons of the Forest footage inspired more questions than answers. 
A new trailer (seen below) continues that exciting, albeit frustrating, tradition of narrative vagueness. However, this time around, we finally got a release date set for Spring 2022.

                    <span>Next year, a new story-driven DLC is coming to first-person cyberpunk action-platformer, Ghostrunner, and it’s called Project_Hel. 
IGN revealed the news yesterday after developer 505 Games teased the “Ultimate DLC” last week. It turns out that “Ultimate DLC” was Project_Hel, the upcoming story-driven DLC where players will control Hel, one of the bosses from the game. Project_Hel will go live in January, but before that, some players will have the chance to go hands-on with it during a private beta held sometime before the DLC’s launch. 
Hel will be a “combat-oriented character designed to appeal to ‘new players and veterans,’ and will feature her own ability progression system,” according to IGN. The story of Project_Hel will take place over six new missions that task Hel with descending from Dharma Tower, a locale heavily featured in the base game. Alongside new missions, Project_Hel will include new enemies, new bosses, and six new songs from Daniel Deluxe. 
505 Games told IGN that it was initially planned as a smaller DLC before becoming a “full-blown Ghostrunner experience.” It will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on January 27. It will cost $14.99.
The studio also revealed that a new Holiday Pack would hit the game on December 7, and it’s a free cosmetics pack that includes holiday swords with matching gloves and more. 
While waiting for Project_Hel to launch in January, read about how native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Ghostrunner launched back in September. Then, check out this flashy neon pack that launched back in August alongside new assist options and a roguelike wave mode. Read about how 505 Games has already confirmed Ghostrunner 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC after that.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop three times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as a cool camo option for your spartan and vehicles (see above).
The biggest bundle is the Anubis Armor Set for the Mark VII Spartan. This set offers the Arctic Void Epic Armor Coating, the Anubis Epic Helmet, a new visor and shoulder pads, and the rather mundane Vigilant Watch stance. It retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.
The most visually pleasing option in this week&#x27;s offering is the Splinter Desert Epic Armor Coating that gives your Spartan a gray camo look. This texture can also be applied to all vehicles. This bundle is 1,500 credits.
If you love seeing your Spartan stand in generic poses, you can purchase the Tacticlamp 117 bundle to get another stance of a Spartan holding a pistol in a rather trivial way. The last item offered is the Reach Falcon Pilot Pack, consisting of a Falcon Nameplate and matching vehicle and weapon Emblems, along with new shoulder pads for your Spartan. This pack requires you have the Mark V armor from the Heroes of Reach Battle Pass. You can see all of the items in the image below:</span>

                    <span>Over the past couple of days, sites like Game Rant, which we first saw surface these stats, have been keeping an eye on how Steam users are spending their time by comparing two disparate but new titles from the month of November. One is a humble farming sim, while the other is a blockbuster multiplayer shooter. Which would you guess more people are playing on the platform just weeks after launch? As of 6:30 p.m. on November 30, Farming Simulator 22 was beating Battlefield 2042 in concurrent Steam users. That&#x27;s a bit of a surprise, yeah?
In the image above (captured from Steam&#x27;s own data you can see here), the numbers on the left represent current active players for each game, while the numbers on the right are total players for the day. As of the time of this snapshot, Farming Simulator 22…</span>

Yes, but this is true so often that I&#x27;ve grown blasé. I am a hedonistic king and I have grown weary of pleasure. Stardew Valley, Halo Infinite and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator cannot rouse me out of ennui.

Titanfall 1, the studio&#x27;s first game, is being removed from sale today and will disappear from subscription services on March 1st, 2022. It&#x27;s the inevitable end for the wall-running mech battler, a multiplayer experiment that started cutting bits out of itself mere months after release.

                    <span>The folks over at Heart Machine have slid back into the fold with a game set in the same universe as their action-adventure debut Hyper Light Drifter. Except this time it’s not a top-down hack-and-slasher, but a stylish skate to save a civilisation on the brink of collapse. Solar Ash sees you flipping onto the backs of massive monsters and felling them like you’re performing athletic acupuncture. So yes, it does retain something from its predecessor, and that’s the element of cool. This is a cool game. One that excels when it lets you off the leash, only, that doesn’t happen as often as I’d have liked.

On December 15th, players will be able to jump into a fresh set of campaign missions in the looter shooter, but instead of playing as your usual Warframe, you&#x27;ll hop into the shoes of a bunch of different characters. The devs call it a &quot;cinematic expansion&quot; that&#x27;s  chock-full of story stuff answering &quot;long-standing questions&quot; about the game&#x27;s universe.

                    <span>Last year, Overwatch introduced an experimental mode that Blizzard have mostly used to test potential balance changes, and show players what the devs have been messing around with internally. They tend to be fairly minor tweaks, and there hasn&#x27;t been an experimental update in a little while. But last night we finally got a new one, and from what I&#x27;ve played it&#x27;s full of daft and fun tweaks. Prepare yourselves for flying Roadhogs and Genjis, nanoboosted Anas, and a handful of wonderfully-timed voicelines.

The developers have announced plans to release version 1.0 on the 2nd of February, 2022. The care and attention to detail of this mod is stunning, looking so much nicer than both Capcom&#x27;s official makeover and the recent Resident Evil 4 VR, and I can hardly wait to play RE4 again with it.

                    <span>A new map, a new killer, and a new survivor all arrive in the asymmetrical 4v1 horror hide-and-seek game Dead by Daylight today. In fact, they’re in right now! The killer, Carmina Mora, is the Artist – commanding a twisted murder of ink crows that can highlight and harm survivors with a little savvy placement. While her projectile assault may not be as direct as the Huntress’s ax or some of the other long-range options, her kit expands with add-ons and can be used to play keep away on pallets or windows that look prime for a chase.

Depending on how she’s played, she can either use her artistic swarm to help track down survivors and keep tabs on them over long distances or be used for direct assault at close range. However, even more interesting and imp…</span>

                    <span>A new Starfield trailer today takes a bit of a different approach compared to the traditional sizzle reel or gameplay blast. Instead, you can take a look at Starfield in a very different fashion, with a behind-the-scenes look with game director Todd Howard, studio director Angela Browder, and art director Matt Carofano. It’s more of a micro look at Bethesda’s approach to their games, their stories, and their open worlds. It’s more of a conversational approach than a lot of game trailers, but it looks like it’s simply setting the stage for lots more to come regarding Starfield. Check out the full video right here.

This is really just Episode One of a Starfield trailer series, so inevitably there will be a lot more on the way before Starfield’s release. In case you were wondering, Starfield is set to hit on November 11, 2022. That may seem like a long way off, but I’m sure we’ll get to see a lot more from the game as we progress into next year. Yeah yeah, I know. I want to see some serious gameplay slices too. We’ll get there. What do you think it’s going to be like? We do know some things… Expect wars, space pirates, and mysteries to unravel.

                    <span>Media Molecule has announced Ancient Dangers: A Bat’s Tale, a new playable game the studio made in its 2019 creation game, Dreams.  
The game seems to be centered on two dungeon-crawling protagonists who must battle “hideous monsters” and solve “fiendish puzzles” to advance through Ancient Danger’s medieval setting. There is, of course, loot and wealth to be found throughout each of these dungeons, and there seems to be a cute bat at the center of its story, as the name alludes to.

As you can see in the trailer above, Ancient Dangers looks quite great and it’s tough to picture it as a game made inside Dreams, which is itself a game. Credit to Media Molecule, though, for doing just that. Ancient Dangers looks great, too, which is especially exciting because it’s already out as of today. 
Here’s the official description for Ancient Dangers:
Ancient Dangers is a third-person dungeon crawler, featuring a single-player mode where players control Scoria, and a co-op mode, which adds Scoria’s twin, Gabbro, to the mix. The co-op mode is couch co-op only, though. Media Molecule says new PlayStation trophies have been added to Dreams for players to unlock while playing through Ancient Dangers, too, so if trophy hunting is your thing, you don’t want to miss this.

The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>Players have had plenty of time to dive into Halo Infinite’s multiplayer experience, but as we move closer and closer to the December 8th launch date, anticipation has been building for the campaign experience as well. After weeks of throwing around the oddball and hacking up competitors with the sizzling sword, is it time to take the campaign trek? Well, here’s the first big trailer from the campaign, unveiled today.

FPS campaigns often range from the mundane to the majestic and we don’t know just where Halo Infinite’s falls just yet. Clearly, much has changed since the underwhelming demo slice of legend that gave rise to big-time internet memes and a fair amount of concern about what the final game would play like. That said, we’ll be looking closely to see what the verdict is as we get closer to launch. While multiplayer hasn’t been without issues, especially ones related to battle pass progression, game customization, and more, overall Halo Infinite’s “return to form” for Halo seems to be well received thus far. Take a look at how the campaign has changed from its initial reveal to now in the video below!

There’s not a whole lot you can extrapolate from a trailer like this except “get hype”, and with a game like Halo, you’re already probably either onboard for what this new campaign experience is poised to serve up or unlikely to be swayed by what’s on deck here. Where do you stand, Spartan? Are you ready to blast off in the new campaign or are you passing on it entirely? If so, are you still in for the free-to-play multiplayer part of the experience?

                    <span>Endwalker, the upcoming expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is almost here. In fact, players with early access packages can begin playing the expansion as soon as Friday, December 3. Of course, as with any MMORPG launch (and many other online games), the first few days are likely to be dicey affairs when it comes to server queues, login woes, and other various assorted issues as players all attempt to login at the same time and play. We saw this happen earlier this year with New World – and seeing it occur in some capacity for the Endwalker launch would not be unusual, given the hype for this big, big expansion that features several new jobs and a ton of new content to explore.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t much envy Bethesda. All game development seems like a bunfight with the impossible, but following in the footsteps of Skyrim is surely cursed. Starfield, the team&#x27;s sci-fi open-world game, needs to be the same and different and better than Skyrim, a game that has been consistently popular for ten years.

In the latest, teasing, behind-the-scenes Into The Starfield video, the development team discuss some of the values that remain the same between Starfield and Bethesda&#x27;s other games. It maybe starts with the cups.

                    <span>The Grand Theft Auto games are full of jokes - or, as I like to call them, &quot;jokes&quot;. I&#x27;m referring to the series&#x27; habit of replacing words in signs and company names with rude soundalikes or double entendres.

These jokes have been restored by GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&#x27;s latest patch, which corrects spelling on signage, puts the hard angles back on the Tuff Nut logo, and stops it raining indoors quite so often.

                    <span>If you enjoy games where people are trapped somewhere mysterious in a deadly game, here&#x27;s a new one for you: World&#x27;s End Club. Released on PC today following Apple Arcade and Switch versions, it&#x27;s made by a team including two heavy-hitting murdergame veterans: the director of the Zero Escape series, and the writer of Danganronpa. It&#x27;s about a group of schoolchildren who find themselves in an undersea theme park and are forced by a clown to- oh for, what is it with these cheery mascots who have one jacked-up eye and a propensity for violence?

Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 arrived today, bringing with it deeper underground layers, taller mountains, and a couple of new biomes to explore. I&#x27;ve been really eager for the 1.18 update specifically so I can build a nice home in the new Lush Cave biomes. Underground houses are the best! And now I can live near pretty cave plants!

Atari are releasing Sid Meier&#x27;s classic Command series on Steam tonight, so you&#x27;ll be able to get your hands on Decision In The Desert, Crusade In Europe, and Conflict In Vietnam. They&#x27;re a vintage bunch of RTS games that make you a commander in various wars, you know, if wars were about controlling tiny little blocky tanks in a bright blue desert.

                    <span>In the last few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time looking through scopes. Red dots and ACOGs and telescopic ones. From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

Named High Calibre, it introduces new defensive operator Thorn, who&#x27;s special gadget is a sticky grenade that explodes into razors when it detects an enemy. Ouch. The other big change with this season is a rework of the Outback map, which cleans up a lot of junk to improve sightlines, and help attackers strategise.

Tactical RPG Wartales gave me the opportunity to promote a wild boar to the captain of my troupe of wandering mercenaries. I did not. Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

Clarity Boost, as they call it, aims to make games look better through some client-side processing fanciness. The feature is currently only supported in a test version of the Microsoft Edge browser, planning to roll out to regular Edge soon.

                    <span>Though Halo Infinite launched in decent shape (our Ed called it &quot;the most stable FPS I&#x27;ve played all year&quot;), one bone of contention has been the slow pace to unlocking things on the battle pass. The developers, 343 Industries already boosted progression pace, but evidently that wasn&#x27;t enough, and now they&#x27;re coming round for another pass at the pass. From today, they&#x27;re planning to offer bonus XP for the first six matches you play every day.

They say the extra three months will help ensure their team keep a healthy work-life balance, while having more time to add polish and go through QA.

Not big news, but welcome news, especially considering how many new players the game has picked up since going half-price in Black Friday sales.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

                    <span>Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she&#x27;s written a message on the palm of her hand reading &quot;He is alive&quot;. I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

                    <span>Gamesplanet is the next in a long line of vendors to post up its seasonal offerings - now into its second week of Xmas deals. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year&#x27;s festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that&#x27;s where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

                    <span>Earlier this month, Platinum Games held a closed beta for their upcoming action RPG, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that&#x27;s because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

                    <span>It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

We&#x27;ve only spotted the deal at Amazon at the moment, but the good news is that they&#x27;re still running the £50 / $50 credit voucher promo in additon to the headset saving, which means you save a total of £100 if you buy one today.

                    <span>They Always Run is the closest I’ve come to living out my dream of being a galactic bounty hunter. It’s a 2D platformer with two distinct halves to its gameplay. One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer beta has only been out for a couple of weeks, but the free-to-play FPS doesn&#x27;t have effective anti-cheat, and it&#x27;s really beginning to show. Players have been posting clips on social media of supposed cheaters using wallhacks, aimbots and more. Now Xbox Halo players are asking developers 343 Industries for an option to turn crossplay off, so they don&#x27;t have to deal with pesky PC hackers.

                    <span>It may be below freezing outside, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our hard working PCs will keep as cool. Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it&#x27;s vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.
Thankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.

                    <span>Black Friday may be over - technically - but PC hardware sellers are still keeping plenty of prices low for Cyber Monday. Some hefty deals are therefore still ripe for the picking, like this huge saving on the MSI Optix MAG272CQR gaming monitor.

                    <span>An MMORPG set in the magical world of Marvel&#x27;s wizards is apparently in development at the studio behind DC Universe Online. That news comes from a new financial presentation from Enad Global 7, the parent company of folks include DCUO devs Dimensional Ink Games and DCUO publishers Daybreak. What actually is the Marvel MMO? A secret, for now. But I wouldn&#x27;t feel wrong making some assumptions.

                    <span>Welcome to Cyber Monday, gang. While today usually marks the last chance to jump on any lingering Black Friday deals, there can and will be some shiny new savings on PC gaming hardware as well – hardware like the Gigabyte B550M DS3H, a microATX motherboard that’s dropped into prime territory for first-time builders on tight budgets.


Amazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.

                    <span>CETIN nabídne od 1. března 2022 nové tarify pro uživatele na optických přípojkách, které výrazně navýší upstream pro koncové uživatele. Nově budou mít zákazníci na výběr tarify 250/250 Mb/s, 500/500 Mb/s a 1000/500 Mb/s. CETIN tak reaguje na zvyšující se nároky spojené zejména se stále rozšířenějším využitím cloud computingu, videokonferencí či streamování – prostě všech aktivit, které vyžadují posílení uploadu. Zájemci o tyto nové tarify je mohou získat od poskytovatelů, kteří danou akci využijí, zrychlení ovšem není automatické a záleží na nabídce providerů, píše CETIN v oznámení.</span>

                    <span>Well, chums, Black Friday itself has been and gone. I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.

                    <span>As those of you who have been hiding behind my sofa, or just read our “What are we all buying this Black Friday?” article, are aware, the top item on my Black Friday shopping list was a new chair. I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.

Luckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free. You do have to buy a laptop first though.

                    <span>Around this time last year, I put out a call for headset recommendations, looking for something cheapish and not terrible. An Internet Friend offered me an old set and I gratefully accepted, not being in the position to turn down free stuff. A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears. Using it is like having an angel gently hug my head while they whisper game noises in my ears.

Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that the SteelSeries Arctis headsets are very good and you should totally check out the SteelSeris Arctis 7 deals we have featured below the jump.

                    <span>Rest up, reader dear. The most important day of year is almost here: Cyber Monday. And it&#x27;s likely to be a big one! I do not know why so many of the megacorps now celebrate the day dedicated to all those cyberpunks who fight against injustice and corruption every day of their lives, but it&#x27;s a day which deserves recognition. So rest today and play some games in-between polishing your mirrorshades, dusting off your leather, and preparing a fresh boot disc. On Monday we hack the planet, but what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>When I write one of these Black Friday deal posts for your perusal, the first thing I do is light up a candle and delve into the dusty depths of the RPS archives to see if we have reviewed the product in question. Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

                    <span>RPS chums, I have been unleashed! After serving my apprenticeship, I am now a fully fledged junior deals warlock, and just in time for Black Friday. I still have to do exactly what I’m told, but now I’m allowed to pull the big, brass lever that fires the deals cannon. In practice, that means I can keep updating you with the best bargains late into the sunless hours, while  James goes home to do whatever hardware editors do in their free time. Since I have promised not to publish my thirty seven page manifesto entitled “Why I think dogs should vote,” I’m going to talk about this BenQ MOBIUZ EX2710Q monitor instead.

                    <span>As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there&#x27;s one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn&#x27;t win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever played.

                    <span>Typically, I&#x27;d associate Google Docs with work, and any form of spreadsheet with even more work, but indie game developer &quot;droqen&quot; has made me reassess that outlook. He&#x27;s the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing.

I know that it’s Actual Black Friday and I’ve had a bit of a rubbish week and coming up with new openers to these deal highlights is starting to get a bit difficult now. I don’t care that I have a bunch of Google docs that have stuff like “I’ve been playing Empire of Sin so I know all about offers you can’t refuse oh this is bloody awful and you are an absolute hack Caelyn” written in them. It doesn’t even matter that this is RPS and Baron James von Hardware-Editor is quite happy to let me make all the puns I like (well, don&#x27;t test me - J). I have standards and that means I will not make the obvious Crucial joke.
Actually I will. It’s Crucial that you check out these fantastic portable SSD deals.

It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve found ourselves here, looking at some indie games, and once again I have been drawn to some that are a little melancholy, but in a sort of healing, wholesome way. I&#x27;m not sure if that says anything great about my state of mind right now, but hey - the nights are drawing in, there&#x27;s a bit of a nip in the chip, and it&#x27;s the time of year when we&#x27;re encouraged to think about family, found or otherwise. And who in their 30s doesn&#x27;t get sad thinking about that.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is, once again, all about the big releases. Battlefield 2042&#x27;s in a bit of state, so we talk about the many patches scheduled to fix it up. We&#x27;ve also heard that those banned in Call Of Duty: Vanguard will be banned across the entire series, which is nice. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer surprise launched and Outriders DLC appears out of nowhere too. Imogen rounds off the news with her Apex Legends ranked update. Has she reached the platinum dream?

                    <span>Alright bargain-hunters, here&#x27;s another one for you: GOG&#x27;s Black Friday sale has now started. It might not be as big as Steam&#x27;s sale (check out our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations) but GOG&#x27;s games are (mostly) DRM-free, and many of their good discounts are the same. Deals include 90% off Shadow Tactics, half-price Cyberpunk 2077, 80% off The Witcher 3 GotY... yeah, these will do nicely.

                    <span>I recently spent a couple of weeks with the Roccat Pyro as my main work and gaming keyboard, and it was a lovely bit of kit for the price; full-size mechanical keyboards rarely cost under £100, yet here was one that started at £90 and had everything a typical PC gamerist could ask for. Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.


For such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. 


Sadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.

                    <span>If you enjoy carefully constructing a lineup of warriors in games like Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train, here&#x27;s a surprising recommendation: play Super Auto Pets. The free-to-play auto-battler reminds me much more of those games than the likes of Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics, focused on building and arranging a line whose abilities will compliment each other. And for something so cute and simple-sounding, it has a delightful amount of buildcrafting. Even the F2P monetisation is good!

                    <span>Black Friday is here. There are only deals. Deals on games. Deals on monitors. Deals on graphics cards, in the sense that they’re slightly less of a rip-off. The deals converge, parting the clouds and blackening the sky until but one shines through: £110 off the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. Hey. That’s pretty good.

                    <span>The Apocalypse came, and it was a shambles. The angels, you see, the divine powers, they did not anticipate that the world had changed, and instead of a hundred million people still impressed by hot food, they had to deal with 8 billion who had long since invented the AK47, and when the holy fires came, humanity tooled up.
This is how the Sin Collector Colon Repentless starts. I am enjoying it a great deal.

It hasn’t been left out of the Black Friday deals party, as Argos are offering a three-month subscription at a discounted price.

                    <span>Next week&#x27;s free game on the Epic Games Store will be a big&#x27;un: Dead By Daylight. I&#x27;ve been impressed by the 1v4 multiplayer horror game, watching it steadily grow into one of Steam&#x27;s most popular after a while looking like it might slip a way, so that&#x27;s a nice get. But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild. You know, you can skip guns and just play that as a very pretty walking simulator.

Therefore, finding a good one is imperative - especially for anyone spending long stints gaming while using said keyboard. Within the stellar range of gaming keyboards on offer, there are a few different types: ones with lights, mechanical, compact, wireless - I could go on. The beauty of Fnatic&#x27;s offering is that it covers most bases, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.

                    <span>Katharine and I went hands-on with Babylon’s Fall last week, that online action RPG by PlatinumGames which falls in and out of memory as the years tick by. Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.
As it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.

Also tune in to learn about Matthew&#x27;s new (and extremely one-sided) rivalry with an Olympic swimmer, a cavern of lies featuring bar tender Ed Harris, and a digression so self-indulgent we talk about how self-indulgent we are, and decide that it is a good thing.

                    <span>Recently, I’ve moved out of the city and into a little village in the middle of nowhere. Look outside the window and I see trees, maybe a little house nestled atop a hill. I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.
Yeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it.

                    <span>Don’t let Let’s Build A Zoo&#x27;s appearance fool you. It has the gorgeous pixel art and presentation of a classic tycoon game, as well as all the simulation aspects you’d ever want. But buried under that business management exterior is a game equally interested in exploring moral choices, and one that leaves me thankful it pauses before I have to make a decision.

                    <span>Třetina českých IT profesionálů vydělává víc než 67 000 korun čistého měsíčně. Vyplývá to z rozsáhlého průzkumu společnosti No Fluff Jobs, kterého se účastnilo 4 185 IT profesionálů, z toho téměř 800 Čechů. Region střední a východní Evropy je proto podle společnosti No Fluff Jobs pro místní IT odborníky velmi lukrativní.</span>
