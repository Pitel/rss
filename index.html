What&#x27;s a Thursday without another exciting episode of The Game Informer Show? We&#x27;re back to our regular scheduled release and today we&#x27;re diving into our impressions of Forspoken, Sifu, and our Game of the Year pick for 2021. That&#x27;s not all though. Jill, John, Stadnik, and Van Aken are here to go over their personal top ten lists and discuss what games made a huge impact on them in a stacked year.

                    <span>Today marks the 30th anniversary of the North American release of Nintendo&#x27;s first handheld gaming device, the Game Boy. Released in 1989, the Game Boy was a successor of sorts to the hugely successful NES, but was completely handheld. To commemorate the occasion we decided to debate our 10 favorite games released for the original handheld. You could argue the Game Boy and its successor the Game Boy Color were essentially the same system, but in order to keep this list as close to the original Game Boy as possible, we decided not to include great Game Boy Color games like Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver (which was playable on the original Game Boy, but released with the Game Boy Color logo on its spine) and Color-exclusive games like Metal Gear Solid (Metal Gear: Ghost Babel in Japan). We also skipp…</span>

                    <span>Square Enix and Marvel have revealed a new collaboration with Adidas in the form of six new sneakers inspired by the universe’s most unlikely team. 
Announced today, this collection will launch in 2022 and feature six unique shoes, each inspired by one of the Guardians. There are two based on Eidos Montreal’s take on Star-Lord, and then one for Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. However, Square Enix did not reveal the price for any of these sneakers so we’ll likely learn more sometime next year. 
“A key starting point for the design of each sneaker was the unique visual cues from each of the characters – whether it’s the stitching details on Star-Lord’s leather jacket, Groot’s earthy color palette, or Drax’s unmistakeable tattoos,” Adidas senior designer James Liu said in a press release. “From there, we wanted to inlay various design discovery elements that helped further bring the story of reach character to life. Bringing it all together across the collection are unique signifiers for this original take on Guardians of the Galaxy as a Super Hero team – with matching sockliners, hang tags, labels, and packaging.” 
For more information about the collaboration and how the shoes came to be, you can read Square Enix’s full interview with Liu here. As for what the shoes are, here’s what you can expect: Star-Lord Forum Hi 84, Star-Lord Forum Mid, Gamora ZX 2K Boost 2.0, Drax Ozelia, Groot NMD R1, and Rocket ZX 1K Boost. Here’s what each looks like:

                    <span>It&#x27;s no secret Magic: The Gathering is returning to one of its most requested planes in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty. Though a few years ago, Wizards of the Coast would have said it would be extremely unlikely we&#x27;d see the Japanese-inspired location represented in its own set again. Today, we&#x27;re getting our first good look at what Kamigawa is like in the present day, full of more bright lights and advanced technology than we&#x27;ve ever seen in Magic before.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>IGN published a new report last Friday detailing a toxic work culture at Bungie, including sexism, crunch, and an HR department that protects abusers, amongst other problems such as stories of repeated microaggressions, inequality, and more. IGN spoke to 26 current and former employees of Bungie to create this report and, just under a week after its publishing, Bungie’s head of HR, Gayle d’Hondt, has stepped down. 
d’Hondt announced this to Bungie employees by email yesterday, and IGN saw said email in full. The former head of HR said she wants to do “everything in my power to make sure everyone who works here has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.” In doing so, d’Hondt said she feels Bungie’s leadership team needs to move forward with people new, or rather, people that haven’t…</span>

                    <span>The first event for Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, Fracture: Tenrai, wrapped up a couple of weeks ago and while it brought some new armor and game modes to the game, it was met with criticism largely surrounding the event-specific battle pass and its associated progression, store cosmetics, and more. 
It seems 343 Industries listened to feedback because yesterday, during a Halo Holiday 2021 livestream, the studio’s head of design, Jeff Hook, detailed various changes coming to Fracture: Tenrai when the event returns in January, as reported by Eurogamer.

                    <span>Red Candle Games is the team behind well-received horror games Devotion and Detention, but it teased a seemingly less spooky new project in March. The studio released a brief clip of a 2D action game labeled as a work in progress, and today we have a title and a hint at what the adventure entails.
The game is called Nine Sols, and Red Candle Games describes it on Twitter as a “hand-drawn 2D action platformer with Sekiro-inspired deflection-focused combat.” The game stars a vengeful hero on a journey to kill nine rulers, called Sols, of a forgotten realm inspired by Asian fantasy. This world was also home to an ancient alien race. The official art posted below reveals the protagonist’s cat-like appearance (which was obscured by a hat in the demo clip).
Nine Sols doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms, so it’s probably a ways off. Still, given the quality of Red Candle Games&#x27; horror titles, it’s exciting to see the team tackle something outside of what&#x27;s become their usual wheelhouse. 
In the meantime, check out our review of Red Candle Games&#x27; most recent release, Devotion.</span>

Since Turtle Rock Studios released Back 4 Blood back in October, players have been asking for a way to play the game offline and still be able to progress. That’s now possible thanks to the December 2021 update. This update also brings some other requested features to the shooter as well.

                    <span>Square Enix has temporarily halted sales of Final Fantasy XIV due to the ongoing Endwalker congestion issues. 
The company has also offered up additional free game-time to players who own the game or have an active subscription, adding another 14 days of time on top of the seven announced last week. This news comes by way of an FFXIV Lodestone blog post made yesterday by director and producer Naoki Yoshida. Yoshida originally issued warnings of expected Endwalker congestion in November and as predicted, the servers filled up immediately, with some players hitting queues with over 5000 people ahead of them.

It’s not surprising, though, considering the MMO added 1 million new players ahead of Endwalker’s launch.

More specifically, the MCU version of Spider-Man and MJ in Spider-Man: No Way Home will be hitting the Fortnite Item Shop today at 7 p.m. EST. That’s not all, though, as this Spider-Man will include Tom Holland’s “Integrated” No Way Home Suit and his Black and Gold Suit. Plus, it includes an emote that removes his mask. 
Those are just two of the new skins coming to Fortnite today. Now that the 2021 Winterfest is live, which runs until January 6, 2022, players can earn up to 14 presents from Sgt. Winter, including three outfits.

I began The Gunk with eager anticipation, blasting across the swirling clouds of the cosmos. The opening cinematic is beautiful and full of promise. Unfortunately, it is also the apex of the short game’s trajectory. In a game filled with alien worlds splashed with color and populated with extraterrestrial mysteries, The Gunk falls surprisingly flat. Fortunately, this spacecraft manages to stay afloat with likable characters, solid gameplay, and a serviceable story.

The Indie World broadcast this week had plenty of good games, including some excellent efforts that were squeezed into a sizzle reel near the end. One of these was GRIME, a &#x27;soulslike Metroidvania&#x27; that&#x27;s been well received so far and is heading to Switch in Summer 2022.
It&#x27;s a title that&#x27;s earned plenty of fans on Steam, with &#x27;Very Positive&#x27; user reviews to back up the critical acclaim highlighted in the trailer. Its &#x27;mutating weapons&#x27; mechanic sounds intriguing, and we&#x27;re certainly hopeful that it can be well optimised for Switch.

As much as I want to catch up on all the heart-racing tension of all the TV shows that everyone else is watching — Squid Game, Succession, the new season of The Witcher — I just don&#x27;t have the energy for it. If I only have an hour or two after work, I don&#x27;t want to spend it on edge, and it doesn&#x27;t help that shows like Squid Game really put me off my dinner.

                    <span>They chose... wisely.
Pinball FX3 is a pretty darn good pinball app on the Switch; it&#x27;s well worth a look courtesy of its free-to-play model and its support of TATE / Vertical mode. Zen Studios has been the lead studio for virtual pinball for a number of years, yet sometimes its many new tables and releases are limited to specific apps (FX3 isn&#x27;t the only one) or platforms. Thankfully, confirmation of a much-loved Williams table recreation came with good news on that front - Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure is heading to Pinball FX3 on Switch (and pretty much every platform).
Confirmed in the Pinball Show below - though the trailer above actually dropped a little ahead of time - it&#x27;s targeting a March release, and will have a legacy option that serves as a faithful recreation of the original table as well as an enhanced version with 3D graphics and other interactive shenanigans. The actual table on which it&#x27;s based arrived in 1993 and had scenes based on the original trilogy of films.

                    <span>Update: Play Asia pre-order links also live.
One item that adds to Link&#x27;s iconic look is the Hylian shield. It&#x27;s been featured in The Legend of Zelda games for a very long time now, and in his latest outing, Breath of the Wild, it also shows up.
If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to own Link&#x27;s shield yourself, you won&#x27;t want to miss out on this latest offer from First 4 Figures. Pre-orders are now available from the F4F website - with an introductory offer of $109.99 USD instead of the usual $120.99 USD. And there&#x27;s an estimated release date of Q1, 2022.

                    <span>This is what happens when the Pokémon nozzle gets clogged.
You know we love bot-generated content. We&#x27;ve used various bots to create front-page stories, and to write a better Ace Attorney script than Shu Takumi, but we haven&#x27;t dabbled too much in the wild and wonderful world of Pokémon.
But Max Woolf has. Woolf is a data scientist at Buzzfeed, and has even created his own AI generation tools for creating bot-written text. One day, he woke up and decided to &quot;feed&quot; a bunch of Pokémon images to a bot — &quot;a fine-tuned ruDALL-E&quot; that&#x27;s not available to the public, because of its unique specifications and user-unfriendliness — to create brand new, almost-believable Pokémon.

                    <span>Pokémon&#x27;s latest releases pass 2 million boxed sales in the country.
Famitsu&#x27;s Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 12th December, revealing that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have remained on top for a fourth consecutive week, in the process passing two million physical copy sales.
It was a quiet week overall with no new releases in the top 10, but once again it&#x27;s a Switch lockout. Nintendo&#x27;s system and games are enjoying a dominant period at present, and it&#x27;s worth noting that this isn&#x27;t necessarily the peak shopping season yet in Japan - that&#x27;ll come in January.

Switch eShop - New Releases
Aspire: Ina&#x27;s Tale (Untold Tales, 17th Dec, £11.69 / €12.99) - Ina was trapped, placed in perpetual slumber inside the Tower – where she dreamed. Suddenly and unknowingly, she is woken. Ina must now explore the Tower’s inner chambers in search of a way out and a reason for her imprisonment. Along the way, she’ll traverse marvelous scenery, meet enigmatic characters, solve intuitive puzzles, and conquer platforming sequences as she comes closer to her goal - but farther from innocence. For this isn&#x27;t a story about how Ina was saved. This is the story about how she discovered she could be so much more.

                    <span>Much more fun than Regular Possible Path.
Spoilers: The road is, in fact, possible. Yes, it’s another example of flagrant false advertising and the sort of thing that gives this fine hobby an ill reputation. No, we’re joking. Of course we’re joking. It’s not impossible to traverse, it’s impossible to build. A road free-floating in space on which giant balls (stop giggling) roll and race for intergalactic supremacy. So far, so Iggy’s Reckin’ Balls, but Rogue Games&#x27; Super Impossible Road takes this Elon Musk vision of a dystopian future (trust us, it’s what he wants) and rolls with it. Get it? That was another joke.
Alright, we’ve had our fun – now for some fun. Super Impossible Road, if you’ll excuse the cynicism, elicited a bit of a groan from this writer on its assignment. It’s just not the most auspicious-sounding title, is it? It dredges up cursed memories of terrible autorunners and hi-larious “masocore” flash games offering vaguely similar experiences. But this is different – this is genuinely pretty good stuff. Polished, varied and compelling, with plentiful features raising the game far above the quality we expected.

DONTNOD is a developer well known for the first two Life is Strange titles (though not the most recent) and popular Game Pass title Tell Me Why. As a studio that&#x27;s helped to popularise the narrative adventure genre in recent years, it&#x27;s now publishing its first third-party title. Gerda: A Flame in Winter, developed by PortaPlay, was in the Indie World sizzle reel this week and arrives next year.
It&#x27;s set in Denmark during its occupation in World War 2, and intriguingly describes itself as an &#x27;RPG-lite narrative&#x27; game. Below are some of the official details.

                    <span>A final free DLC character and cross-play coming, too.
Voice acting for fighters and cross-play has been confirmed for platform fighter Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl.
The good news was delivered by art director Diego Hernández on veteran Super Smash Bros. player Hungrybox&#x27;s stream. Fans of the game have been enjoying the depth and potential of the brawler&#x27;s core gameplay since it launched back in October, although the lack of voices for the cast of characters — including such icons as SpongeBob, the Ninja Turtles, Nigel Thornberry, and Garfield — has been a sticking point for many.

With over 100 million units sold worldwide, there are a lot of Wii consoles out there – many of which, we dare say, are currently languishing inside cupboards and lofts all over the globe, begging to be returned to active service.
They say you should always be careful what you wish for, because one such console has indeed been placed back in active duty – but wearing entirely new clothes. You see, hacker sonictimm took a Wii and decided to pop it inside a toaster. He actually did this five years ago but has only now made footage of this twisted creation available to the public.

Speaking to BBC Gaming Reporter Steffan Powell, Bolt – who is an eight-time Olympic gold medallist and the only sprinter to win 100m and 200m titles at three consecutive Olympics – discussed how he would sometimes miss training in order to indulge in his passion for video gaming.

One of the most intriguing announcements from yesterday&#x27;s Indie World was Afterlove EP, a &#x27;mix-tape visual novel&#x27; set in Jakarta, Indonesia from the creative director of What Comes After and Coffee Talk.
The protagonist is Rama, a musician who is struggling to find his muse after losing the love of his life, Cinta. Cinta may be gone, but her spirit remains and often appears to spur Rama on in his promise to complete an EP of music for his lost love.

Yesterday&#x27;s Indie World showcase gave us plenty to think about when it comes to future eShop purchases, and one of the games which looked the most promising was the long-awaited OlliOlli World.
This slick combination of OlliOlli&#x27;s stunt-based skateboarding with the living, breathing world of &#x27;Radlandia&#x27; has been on our radar for a while now, but the Indie World broadcast gave us a fresh look at what we can expect when it launches early next year.

In the holiday 2006, Nintendo launched its new motion-controlled Wii console and it turned the &quot;world upside down&quot; in the words of former Microsoft/Xbox Game Studios employee Shannon Loftis. It also caught Nintendo&#x27;s competitors by surprise.

                    <span>The makers of Arma and DayZ have revealed Enfusion, the new cross-platform game engine they plan to build future games on. No, Bohemia Interactive haven&#x27;t announced Arma 4, but they do say they would use Enfusion for &quot;any potential new Arma game&quot;, so maybe that&#x27;s something to bear in mind while looking at its screenshots of vast landscapes. While they don&#x27;t have much more than screenshots and a wee video to show right now (sorry, engine enthusiasts), they do hint that they&#x27;ll release some sort of &quot;playable demonstration of its features&quot; at some point &quot;soon&quot;.

                    <span>The Epic Games Store Holiday Sale started today, with lots of discounts and that but more importantly: 15 days of free video games. They&#x27;re starting with one that I&#x27;m certainly curious enough to play for free but not buy: Shenmue 3. Yeah gwan, I&#x27;ll grab that. Epic are also going wild with coupons again, giving a £10 (or $10) coupon on every game you buy which costs at least £13.99 (or $14.99). Given Epic&#x27;s habit of paying for timed exclusives, they do have discounts on some games you&#x27;ll not get elsewhere, or at least not with those vouchers.

                    <span>Let me slap you with the caveat up front. Halo Infinite&#x27;s best place is its open world, through which you can swing like a honking metal Tarzan and do sweet Warthog jumps from cliffs. But its best level, the most satisfying A-to-B gun boulevard, comes late in the campaign (spoilers ahead). The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress. They are abstractly human structures surrounded by sand, as if your extraterrestrial enemies have been playing house but believe a homo sapiens&#x27; house looked exactly like a chunk of Normandy beach circa 1944. The narrative reasoning behind this level is absurd. But the fights that occur within are excellent.

                    <span>God rest ye merry listener, let nothing you dismay - for today, for one night only, EWS stands for Electronic Wrestling Show. Yes, our podcast&#x27;s wrestling promotion has rolled into your town for a showstopping tag team match. Each of your pod hosts fields a three-game tag team of our favourite games of the year, and fields them in a spectacular(ly described) ladder match. The victor will claim the GOTY In The Bank briefcase and win the chance to compete next year as well.
Before we get to that, though, we must first discuss (at length) whether 200 t-shirts is a lot of t-shirts, what Nate is having for his Christmas dinner, what kind of cop duo would be named Halloumi &amp; Date, and also what our favourite Christmas songs are. Nate also does a really good Mankind pun. Plus: which wrestler would be the best hugger?

In fact, I bet it attracts bad sleeps. Anyway, I’m considering the installation of a feathery net because DokeV’s music video from the latest Geoff Awards has infiltrated the darkest recesses of my brain again. I thought I’d shaken off the trailer song, but it’s back with full force and haunts me more than ever.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake certainly knows how to make a good first impression. The original&#x27;s bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar&#x27;s city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series&#x27; best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision.

                    <span>CD Projekt have announced plans to pay out $1,850,000 (£1.4 million) to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors over Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s troubles. The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn&#x27;t been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this &quot;does not imply admission of any responsibility&quot;.

                    <span>It’s been nearly a year since Nvidia started reissuing older GPUs, like the GeForce RTX 2060 and GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, to help deal with the great worldwide graphics card shortage. More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.


Emphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around. So what’s the deal with this mysterious card, and should you even consider buying an RTX 20 series card in this day and age?

                    <span>The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani&#x27;s chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you&#x27;ll want to remedy as soon as possible. 
Your reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it&#x27;s hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image &amp; Form&#x27;s first ever 3D video game. If this is what they&#x27;ve been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image &amp; Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There&#x27;s a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it&#x27;s missing that spark to really make it sing.

This latest OlliOlli game swaps out the 2D style for a cel-shaded 3D world that looks absolutely lovely. Or radical. Or sick. Or other skater words. The action-platformer&#x27;s plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don&#x27;t anger them, kiddos, they&#x27;ll break your collarbones.

Babble Royale is a new Scrabble-like battle royale where 16 players fight to be the last letters standing. You have to make words in such a way that you escape a zone that&#x27;s closing in, and attack other players by building words off of theirs. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, but man, it absolutely does.

They&#x27;ve temporarily suspended sales of the game, as well as new registrations for the free trial version. Even adverts are being stopped for now.

The first full year of a new platform cycle is always exciting. Developers have new technologies to leverage in game releases, and players begin to glimpse the potential of new hardware. This particular new generation of gaming has had an unusual start. The global pandemic meant significant changes to development pipelines, causing production setbacks and global shipping delays. This resulted in games arriving later and new hardware that was difficult to find – even for the most diligent gaming enthusiasts.
Despite those challenges, 2021 came together as an excellent year for video games, filled with remarkable new experiences for players to enjoy. We’ve selected and ranked our picks for the 10 best releases of the year, detailing exactly why these particul…</span>

                    <span>In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…</span>

                    <span>Often overshadowed by the newest generation, games are still being built for and released on the PlayStation 4. After showing what Horizon Forbidden West looks and runs like on PS5, Guerrilla Games has given the world a glimpse at what Aloy&#x27;s next adventure looks like on the previous Sony console. 
In a tweet, Guerrilla offered a peek at four screenshots from Forbidden West running on PlayStation 4 hardware. While it doesn&#x27;t say whether the captures came from a PS4 amateur or a PS4 Pro, the vistas on display are still stunning to behold. Take a glance at the lush jungle flora with a mechanical bird hovering overhead, a desolate desert settlement, the Tallneck in all of its towering glory, and Aloy strolling through a pond riding atop what looks to be the horse-like Strider.

These images do look great, and yes, I&#x27;m sure if you put them next to their PS5 counterparts, you can nitpick which details may be missing, or how far the draw distance for LODs are. But instead, we&#x27;re going to take this preview of the rare PS4 visuals and celebrate how good they look on their own merits. If the performance side of the game pans out as well as these stills have, last-gen PlayStation owners may not feel as much pressure to find an elusive PS5 before Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s February 18 release.</span>

                    <span>The Game Awards has come and gone. Josef Fares referenced his infamous Oscars line while accepting It Takes Two’s Game of the Year award, Halo The Series got a first-look trailer, and Monolith is developing a new Wonder Woman game. But the festivities aren’t over just yet; Xbox is holding a demo event inspired by the awards that offers limited-time, hands-on looks at anticipated games. There are over 35 titles to check out, but not for long. The free celebration ends next week on December 21, leaving players a short window to comb through every experience. However, if you don’t have the time to sample them all, here are the demos you do not want to miss.

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem was announced just six months ago during a Microsoft Xbox showcase and it was received quite well. Featuring the painterly and lush art style of A Plague Tale: Innocence, if one thing was clear with Requiem’s announcement, it’s that publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Asobo Studio are planning to up the ante. Today’s batch of in-game screenshots is proof of that. 
Released on Twitter earlier today, these four screenshots showcase some of what we can expect in Requiem. Based on what we know of the game so far, these screenshots show Amicia and Hugo in new cities south of France, which is the primary setting of the sequel.

Development duties are being headed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the game will be built on the company’s ever-present Snowdrop engine.
The reboot was announced after years of speculation regarding what the next step was for stealth icon Sam Fisher. In an article on the Ubisoft website, word of Splinter Cell’s resurrection comes alongside an interview with developers working on refreshing the series. Producer Matt West sheds some light on the team’s ideas for the project, saying, “To me, a remake takes what you’d do in a remaster and goes a little bit further with it.” He goes on to state the plan is to stick close t…</span>

A new narrative campaign for Terminator: Resistance just launched last week, and our war against the machines will bleed into 2022 with the newly announced RTS game, Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance. Developer Cats Who Play and publisher Slitherine today released the first details and two short videos that give us glimpses at how this future war will unfold for PC players.
Set in the same universe as the Terminator: Dark Fate film from 2019, Defiance delivers a campaign experience that puts you in the role of the Founders faction&#x27;s commander and asks you to keep the last remnants of humanity alive. You may even have the chance to deal a devastating blow to the Legion&#x27;s machines. As you make progress, you&#x27;ll rally allies to your cause, but the choices you make could have consequences.

Cats Who Play revealed details that your weapons and vehicles will take on damage, meaning armor and hull integrity could wear thin over time and leave your troops vulnerable. If a building collapses, the physics-based debris could devastate your efforts. You can also use physics to your advantage to take out well-fortified enemy strongholds.
If you&#x27;d rather play as the machines, you&#x27;ll get the chance to do that in the multiplayer and skirmish modes. In these avenues of play, you can control the Founders, Legion, and Resistance. For multiplayer, the battles can be 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2.
Cats Who Play hopes to have Defiance out in 2022, although no specific date or season has been announced at this time.</span>

                    <span>Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, has launched a “AAA game studio” with former Call of Duty and Halo developers. 
Beahm is one of the more well-known streamers out there, be it the audience numbers he pulls in when streaming or his public ban from Twitch after streaming inside of an E3 bathroom. He’ll still be streaming, but he’s now making the jump to the game development side of video games by way of new studio Midnight Society. 
Welcome to Midnight Society /// https://t.co/xuTZGJskyx pic.twitter.com/RWWQSaXcGY

“We flip the tables on the traditional video game development model and embrace the ‘Day Zero Community,’” the Midnight Society website reads. “That means including our players – yes, you – from the earliest most inception. That could be testing reload times and recoil patterns on a firing range or jumping in for the first-ever PVP sessions. No more ‘I hope this game will be good.’ Be there when your voice can actually make an impact because we want to hear it. Really.” 
As for what to expect from Midnight Society, the studio does not have a formal announcement for a game. However, all signs point to a multiplayer shooter. Be it Beahm’s involvement, former Call of Duty and Halo developers, the mention of “reload times and recoil patterns in a firing range” or the job listing description that urges possible employees to “step up, strap in, and start defining the next best competitive multiplayer experiences, period,” it seems Midnight Society’s first game will be a shooter.

The website features some images, too – seen above – that might hint at what the team’s first game could be. It might be concept art, but it could also be nothing related to whatever Midnight Society is working on as well. We&#x27;ll see sometime in the future.

                    <span>Sony Pictures Entertainment released the first official trailer for its upcoming Uncharted movie, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, back in October and it featured plenty of iconic sequences from Naughty Dog’s action-adventure series. 
That trailer led many to speculate that while Uncharted takes place before the Naughty Dog games, opting to go with a much younger Nathan Drake, the movie would be touching on each of the games in some way. For example, we see the iconic cargo-plane-over-a-desert sequence from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception in the trailer. We also see Chloe Frazer in the trailer, a character who doesn’t appear in the games until Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and the main antagonist seems pulled right out of Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. 
If you were looking for a tie or connection to Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, the newest poster released by Fandango today has you covered. 
As you can see in the poster, it’s quite reminiscent of Uncharted 4, or rather, one of the final settings in it. Near the end of Uncharted 4, our cast is swinging from pirate ship to pirate ship in search of pirate gold and an escape from a ruined pirate city. Nathan Drake eventually makes his way to what is basically a pirate ship graveyard and it looks a lot like what’s seen in the background of this new poster. 
As for how Uncharted will tackle this connection to Uncharted 4 – which mind you, is just speculation for now, but like, come on, look at it – alongside the nods to the other Uncharted games, we’ll have to wait and see when Uncharted is released in theaters on February 18. All that’s left now is to hint at The Lost Legacy and Golden Abyss. 
While waiting for this movie to release, check out the first official trailer and then check out this look at Nolan North, the voice actor of Nathan Drake, on set with Holland.  Are you excited about Uncharted? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>A new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus introduces players to the game’s two rival clans. The aptly named Diamond and Pearl factions (Arceus takes place in the Sinnoh region, after all) are factions you&#x27;ll interact with in addition to the previously revealed Galaxy Expedition Team. 
Both clans share a deep respect for Pokémon though they are divided by their opposing philosophies. The Diamond clan, led by the daring Adaman and his Leafeon partner, values living in the moment with your allies. The Pearl clan cherishes the land itself, and its leader Irida, along with her Glaceon, is suspicious of newcomers. The trailer also introduces Ginkgo Guild Merchants, a traveling guild you’ll purchase goods from.

For those currently playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Arceus has a treat for you. Players with save data from either game will be rewarded a modern Team Galatic set and a research quest that pits you against the mythical Pokémon Darkrai. 
Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches on January 28 for Switch. For more news on the game, check out the recently revealed Hisuian Voltorb and the Hisuian forms of Zorua and Zoroark.</span>

                    <span>GTA Online’s new story update, The Contract, is now live, meaning players get to partner up with Franklin to help his new business succeed by helping Dr. Dre – yes that Dr. Dre – out of a jam. Before you head off on this wild adventure, Rockstar has shared new details about what The Contract entails. 
As previously revealed, you’ll be Franklin’s partner in his new business, F. Clinton and Partner, a fixer agency designed to solve celebrity problems. Your first client is Dr. Dre, who lost his phone containing unreleased music tracks. The Contract can be played entirely solo but you can also rope in friends/groups to play along should you choose. 
Music is central to The Contract, which introduces a new multi-genre radio station MOTOMAMI Los Santos. The station boasts exclusive new music fro…</span>

                    <span>Dead by Daylight just released its original story chapter, Portrait of a Murder, two weeks ago, but it seems Behaviour Interactive is already hard at work on what’s next for the asymmetrical horror game: Ringu. 
Ringu was first released in 1998 in Japan by director Hideo Nakata before it was remade as The Ring in the West by director Gore Verbinski, who would direct a trio of Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney (weird directorial jump, right?). Already a famous horror icon in Japan, Verbinski’s take further solidified the story of The Ring (and Ringu) as a classic in the genre. Now we’re all scared of videotapes, wells, and scary people emerging out of television screens. Behaviour Interactive will revive those fears with its newest chapter, due out in March of 2022.

In keeping with the series&#x27; stealth roots, the game was announced with little to no fanfare this evening via a blog post, with Ubisoft declaring its existence along with some developer chat before scampering back into the shadows. Typical.

Loco Motive is a train-based detective game published by Chucklefish (who also pubbed Stardew Valley and Starmancer), and is the debut game from developers Robust Games. There&#x27;s been a murder! And it&#x27;s your job to figure out who committed the crime. Classic whodunnit stuff that we&#x27;ll get to play next summer.

                    <span>Nerves have been sufficiently jangled as of late, not least thanks to the slew of action packed games that have landed in recent months. I crave an altogether more sedate beginning to next year, and so my mind turns to games in which violence, reflex or any other kind of unblinking attentiveness takes a back seat. 
Looking for a broader mixture of games? Check out our regularly updated list of the best PC games you can play right now.
Primarily we&#x27;re talking violence-free games here, but I wanted to drill a little deeper than that - so nothing that generally requires a competitive streak. I&#x27;m chasing a certain feel rather than a certain category. Flying, walking, puzzling, driving, building, dreaming, climbing, stretching, swinging (not like that), swimming, wondering: these are just a few of the ways in which flashing pixels can make you feel a very different sort of accomplishment.

                    <span>I really don’t like gaming chairs. They’re expensive, often cumbersome, drastically over-designed things that lean way too heavily into the g4m3r aesthetic, and that’s coming from someone who’s built up something of a tolerance to it from years of unprotected RGB exposure. I’ve sat on them and have even shared homes with some of them, but have never, ever seen the appeal over a halfway decent office chair.


And then the Noblechairs Epic TX comes along, and it’s got me rethinking.

                    <span>Christmas is coming, PC gamers. The Untitled Goose is getting fat. Somewhere in the distant north, a scarlet priest works his elven minions into a frenzy as he prepares for the rite of the magic baby. Sprouts will be consumed in their millions, the Great Escape snoozed through by bloated grandparents far and wide. Most importantly, gifts of roughly equivalent financial value will be exchanged to demonstrate affection and prolong the reign of capitalism.

                    <span>I’ve been hands-on with Sifu, a beat ‘em up action-adventure game by Absolver developers Sloclap. My hands weren’t exactly “on”, but more “around”, actually. That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.
Death in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.

                    <span>Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are leaving Xbox Game Pass on 31st December. If you need time to absorb this news, please, take it. Back? Okay, so actually we don’t have much time left now. You must play these beat &#x27;em ups before they disappear into the realms of non-free (sort of; you know what I mean). Here’s why.

                    <span>One of my absolute favourite platformers, Rayman Origins, is free to keep on Ubisoft Connect right now. Ubisoft are giving the 2D side-scroller away as part of their 35th anniversary celebrations, which is wonderful news. It&#x27;s one of the best co-op games I&#x27;ve played, so it&#x27;s a perfectly timed freebie if you&#x27;re in need of something to keep friends and family entertained over the holiday period.

                    <span>The fifteenth door on the Advent Calendar is a bit of a mish-mash, almost as if six different artists had a go at making it at different times. Interesting. Let&#x27;s see what lies on the other side of it.

                    <span>Inscryption is, without a doubt, the best game I&#x27;ve played this year. It&#x27;s creepy, surprising, and superbly fun, and now you can play the best part for as long as you please. Developer Daniel Mullins has released a &quot;mini-expansion&quot; in beta on Steam, which (minor spoilers ahead!) makes its animal-based card game a standalone roguelike experience. Named Kaycee&#x27;s Mod, it&#x27;s slightly tougher than what you might have played already, and adds new challenges too, so you can keep going back in for more.

                    <span>When I finished watching The Game Awards reveal trailer for Rumbleverse, the new Epic-published battle royale game that looks a bit like Fortnite but with melee combat, I raised a practiced eyebrow of derision. &quot;Well, that looks terrible,&quot; chortled I, knowing full well that I&#x27;d still give it a go at the earliest opportunity because I am an absolute sucker for battle royales.
Two things happened later that day that I did not expect. First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse&#x27;s action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I&#x27;d anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I&#x27;ve sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre. Yet those two hours I spent playing Rumbleverse might be the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a battle royale.

                    <span>Update, 12/14/21:
Slayer now has a dedicated playlist in Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer. 
343 Industries announced yesterday that despite what the studio previously said, a Slayer playlist would be coming to Halo Infinite before the year&#x27;s end. In fact, the team announced that it would be coming December 14 and that&#x27;s today. As expected, a Slayer playlist can now be found in Halo Infinite after updating to the current build of the game. 
A Tactical Slayer (SWAT), Fiesta, and Free-For-All playlist have been added as well. For more information about these playlists, head to 343 Industries&#x27; full update breakdown.

                    <span>Nintendo showcased nearly 25 minutes of indie games during today’s Indie World Showcase, and if you weren’t able to catch it, or if you missed the name of the game you’re excited to check out, we’ve got you covered. 
Sea of Stars
Sea of Stars was announced in 2020 as a prequel to Sabotage Studio’s The Messenger, and while we saw it last year, which is where we also learned that Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda is helping compose the game’s score, today’s Indie World Showcase gave us another glimpse into its beautiful world. We saw a new trailer featuring some of its turn-based combat, stunning pixel art, and we heard a taste of what Mitsuda is cooking up. But perhaps the most exciting part was that we have a release window: Holiday 2022.

                    <span>Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Inscryption is one of 2021’s biggest surprises in more ways than one. Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.
The update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. 
❗️Inscryption: Kaycee&#x27;s Mod❗️

To access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. 
In a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level.

                    <span>Nightdive Studio’s remake of System Shock has been in the works for some time. First announced in 2016, the game was tentatively planned to launch this past summer but will now arrive sometime in 2022.
Unfortunately, Nightdive still hasn’t nailed down an exact release date. It did announce a publishing deal with Prime Matter to help bring the game to PC and unspecified consoles. Taking place on an abandoned space station, the first-person game tasks players with surviving a hostile AI named SHODAN and the dangerous enemies lurking aboard.  The original 1994 game is widely considered a classic and a pioneer for story-driven first-person action games. 
Nightdive has also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in the gallery below.

An updated playable PC demo for System Shock was released in February, which you can still download on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Nightdive bills it as the final demo before the game’s full release. 
The wait continues, but some update is better than nothing (unlike the long-lost System Shock 3). In case you missed it, a live-action System Shock TV show is also in the works.</span>

                    <span>Arkane Studios has built a strong cult following over the last decade. Its expertise is developing immersive sims – games that facilitate unpredictable stories and emergent gameplay through player choice, complex AI, persistent systems, and sandbox level design. Like the best immersive sims, Deathloop encourages you to use its robust suite of tools to poke at its many systems and environments to differing results, which then allows you to piece together the best route through any place. However, unlike its predecessors Dishonored and Prey, Deathloop doesn’t have one specific mission, ability, or weapon that stands out as the best part of the adventure. Instead, it showcases how a game’s many elements can interact with one another to create a truly unique experience.
Specifically, the game’s level design and time of day system work together to create a setting that invites exploration and houses adaptive characters to provide consequences to player actions. Add in a consistent ruleset and shared design language that permeates every aspect of Deathloop, and you’ll understand why the title is one of the best releases of 2021.
There isn’t one particular thread greater than the rest. Deathloop is an impressive intersection of stories and gameplay systems woven together to create a tapestry deserving of your attention. In my latest video essay, I break down the game design behind Deathloop in an attempt to better understand one of the best games on PlayStation 5 and my personal favorite game of 2021:

                    <span>Windjammers 2 has been a long-time coming (it was first announced in 2018) and after years of betas, the sequel to the cult-favorite arcade game officially launches next month. 
That would be January 20, to be exact. As for platforms, Windjammers 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. It’s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass. Physical versions are also on the way courtesy of Limited Run Games, though it’s unclear if those will launch day and date with the digital editions. 
Windjammers features a roster of 10 characters, both originals and newcomers, and 10 courts to host the disc-throwing action. Like the 1994 original, two players battle out in what’s essentially over-the-top air hockey with frisbees. Lobbing the disc into the other player’s goal is key, and each character sports their own playstyle and special attacks. Windjammers 2 features new gameplay mechanics, an arcade mode, and online play with casual and ranked matches. Get the full rundown in the new trailer below.

Windjammers 2 is being developed by Dotemu, the team behind Streets of Rage 4 and publisher for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge.

                    <span>Chocobo GP is racing through the finish line in just a few months. 
More specifically, you can race as a Chocobo, your favorite Final Fantasy summon, heroes such as Terra, or someone else entirely when Chocobo GP hits Switch on March 10. That’s less than three months away so you might want to brush up on your kart racing skills soon. And if you’re looking for a great way to do that, look no further than Nintendo’s own Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, because Chocobo GP looks very, very similar in almost every regard.

From the item boxes, err, Magicites, placed throughout the track to the track design and even the way racers drift, Chocobo GP looks very much like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Look, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is arguably the best kart racer out there so it’s not surprising to see another racer take on a similar shape. Plus, if Final Fantasy is more your franchise versus Mario or any of the others highlighted in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then Chocobo GP might be your new favorite kart racer. 
Today’s March 10 release date news was announced in a release date trailer on the Nintendo UK YouTube channel. In it, we get more details about the game, including a brief look at its story mode, some of the characters we can expect to see, and more. We also learn that similar to other kart racers, a series will consist of four races. Although Chocobo GP has its own series ready to go at launch, players can create their own, too. 
The trailer also reveals a quick glimpse at a track we’ve not seen before – you can see it around the 1:26 minute mark and it looks like a Final Fantasy spin on Mario Kart Wii&#x27;s Moo Moo Meadows. Elsewhere in the trailer, you can see the castle track previously shown in the Chocobo GP announcement trailer.

                    <span>Nintendo has some indie games ready to show, and it sounds like we’ll all be getting a glimpse of them during the next Indie World showcase. 
Announced on Twitter today, Nintendo of America says a new Indie World showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. As for what to expect, well, there’s really no telling – considering the name of the event, you can obviously expect to see some indie games, but as for which ones, only Nintendo knows.
Get ready for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase arriving Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT!

Perhaps we’ll finally get some more information about Hollow Knight: Silksong, which was revealed in February 2019 as DLC that transformed into a full-blown sequel. 
We may also learn more about Sports Story, another hotly-anticipated indie game announced over two years ago. There’s a chance we don’t see Sports Story or Silksong, though, so don’t let the hype train leave the station just yet. Other possibilities include Metal Slug Tactics, Lumbearjack, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, all of which were shown back in August’s Indie World Showcase. 
Nintendo says this Indie World showcase will run for 20 minutes, and if it’s anything like previous Indie World showcases, it will, as the name implies, be focused on indie games … so don’t expect to see Breath of the Wild 2 or Splatoon 3 here. For a look at what was previously shown during the last Indie World showcase, which happened back in August, check out Game Informer’s full breakdown.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on “violations of the state’s civil rights and equal pay laws,” specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>While the ETC2 texture compression standard is royalty-free and popular for OpenGL / GLES / Vulkan use, recent AMD Radeon GPUs and APUs have removed their native support for this alternative to the likes of ASTC and S3TC. But now in Mesa 22.0 there is emulated ETC2 support for the Radeon &quot;RADV&quot; Vulkan driver to in turn improve this open-source driver&#x27;s Android support...</span>

                    <span>Praey Of The Gods initially looks too similar to Shadow Of The Colossus for comfort. And then you think: why wouldn&#x27;t someone make another game where you climb and bring low gigantic beasts? After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m filling my ears with the maximalist sounds of a song which knows true suffering, a song from a fictional musician in a video game. Reader dear, it&#x27;s that time of year: if you&#x27;ve not already started, pour a cocoa and join me for Christmas Pain In Christmas Town.

The town management game has its own cryptocurrency, of course, and this weekend they sold NFTs of virtual land for real money. The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

                    <span>Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives&#x27; character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?

Admittedly, the last two we&#x27;ve done (Darkest Dungeon and Wartales) have both been quite small with only limited numbers of codes available, but I&#x27;m pleased to say we&#x27;ve finally put together that long-awaited &#x27;big&#x27; free game drop that all premium supporters will be able to get involved with. 
That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate &#x27;em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here&#x27;s how to get your copy.

CEO Pete Parsons has since issued an apology &quot;on behalf of everyone at Bungie&quot;, acknowledging that the studio needs to listen to these accounts, and do better.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Call of Duty: Vanguard was the best-selling game of last month in the U.S., with Battlefield 2042 coming in right behind it as the second best-selling game of November.

                    <span>Update, 12/13/21:
Thunder Lotus has revealed that Spiritfarer has surpassed 1 million copies sold, a massive milestone for the indie game, and if that&#x27;s not enough, the latest and final update, the Jackie &amp; Daria Update, is out today. 
For more details about the Jackie &amp; Daria Update, check out the original story below. 
Original Story, 12/13/21:
Spiritfarer is getting the final batch of content from its 2021 roadmap, and developer Thunder Lotus bills it as the most significant addition yet. Jackie and Daria are two new spirits joining the fray alongside an uncharted island to explore and a new event. 
The free update arrives on December 13 for all versions of the game. The story sees Stella visit a rundown hospital situated on an unknown island. She meets Jackie, a caretaker and spirit in the form of a hyena, and Daria, a bat and Jackie’s patient. By befriending these two lovable spirits, you’ll help them get the hospital up and running again. As seen in the trailer below, the update adds a new platforming-focused event, and you outfit your ferry with new upgrades.

As previously noted, the Jackie &amp; Daria update will be the game’s last. Two previous add-ons introduced two other spirits, Lily and Beverly, and their respective stories. Now that Spiritfaer is wrapped up, we look forward to seeing what Thunder Lotus has up its sleeve next. 
Spiritfarer is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. You can read our review here to find out why it’s a gem you shouldn’t overlook.</span>

                    <span>The Anacrusis, the four-player co-op FPS set aboard a 1960s-esque starship, will be released as an Early Access title on January 13 and it will hit Xbox Game Pass the same day. 
First shown during an Xbox event held earlier this year, The Anacrusis carries with it some sci-fi Left 4 Dead vibes – be it the hordes of aliens, the four-player co-op elements, or the fact that it’s an FPS, The Anacrusis seems like a day-one game for anyone that’s a fan of Valve’s zombie shooter. Oh, and Anacrusis developer Stray Bombay was co-founded by Left 4 Dead lead developer, Chet Faliszek.

                    <span>The Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for 35 of the last 36 months, having lost to the PlayStation 5 back in September. The streak continued this November. 
Announced in a press release today, the Switch was the best-selling console in the U.S. in November after selling more than 1 million units. The press release cites the NPD Group, which regularly reports on U.S. video games sales each month, and according to the group, the Switch sold 1.13 million units last month. Of course, those 1.13 million units are split between the three variants of the console currently on the market: the Switch, the Switch Lite, and the OLED Model, which was just released in October.

“For the important holiday-shopping week of Thanksgiving, which includes Black Friday, Nintendo Switch was also the top-selling video game console, with nearly 550,000 systems sold,” the press release reads. “With November logged in the record books, Nintendo Switch has now been the top-selling video game console for 35 out of the last 36 months.” 
Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who recently appeared at The Game Award 2021 to accept the Best Action/Adventure Game award for Metroid Dread, says as Nintendo heads into 2022 and the sixth year of Switch, “the system continues to see strong demand” and that the company looks “forward to even more people adding Nintendo Switch to their households.”

                    <span>Microsoft closed Lionhead Studios, the team behind the publisher’s famed Fable series, on April 29, 2016, and since then, it’s remained pretty much silent on that closure. However, in a new Xbox-focused documentary, Microsoft seems to regret how it handled Lionhead, as reported by IGN. 
Power On: The Story of Xbox was announced back in November, and now, the six-part documentary is available for viewing. Running over four hours long, this documentary series covers the entire history of Xbox, including its closure of Lionhead five years ago. Xbox general manager of global games publishing, Shannon Loftis, revealed how the company considered this closure and how it was handled.

                    <span>Is this pandering? If it is, I&#x27;m okay being pandered to. House Flipper Pets VR is a new spin-off from the fixer-upper floor-scrubbing sim which adds dogs, cats and co-op multiplayer. So you can tidy a house with a friend and then fill it with furniture your pet pal will like.

With them came another announcement: this is the cosy management game&#x27;s final update, and its developers are moving onto new things.

If none of that tickles your pick(le)s you could try a keyhole which twists dimensions? Or perhaps one with a steampunk or frost-bitten feel? If literally any of that got your immersion senses tingling then three Skyrim modders have something for you. Creating a cache of realistic looking catches, they have brought the Dragonborn what they&#x27;ve been desperate for; a more riveting lockpicking experience.

                    <span>As someone with bipolar, I have often wondered why sinking several hours into something soothing such as Shovel Knight does so much for my soul. However I recently read that Geek Therapy, a non-profit advocating the use of video games for wellness, promote using world-building games such as Minecraft, Roblox, Animal Crossing, and Fortnite to help people deal with mental health issues. While play therapy has long promoted the therapeutic powers of escapism to imaginary worlds, it is more recently that thought has gone into how these online experiences can be used to combat my, I mean someone&#x27;s, anxiety and depression.

                    <span>Intel’s latest 12th Gen Alder Lake processors include some of the best gaming CPUs money can buy, and they’re not just a big step forward on pure power. They also add support for some new and up-and-coming technologies that that could form the bedrock for even better performance in the future, like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM. In fact, when buying a new, Alder Lake-compatible motherboard, you’ll have a choice to make: stick with DDR4 memory, or upgrade to DDR5?

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company, holding walkouts in the wake of damning reports and layoffs. It&#x27;s reached a point where ABK employees are organising a formal strike, and there&#x27;s been talk of unionisation - talk that ActiBlizz would like to stop. In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation, apparently.

                    <span>Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

                    <span>I usually don&#x27;t like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I&#x27;m not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It&#x27;s a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead&#x27;s Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

                    <span>Update: Yup, it&#x27;s official.
Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. They&#x27;re not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it&#x27;s an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

                    <span>While the Pacific map in Call Of Duty: Warzone ushered in a new WW2 era of beachside battle royale, it also added weapon bloom. Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn&#x27;t hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn&#x27;t the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it&#x27;ll take time to fully remove.

                    <span>The Sniper Elite series has found a comfortable 7/10 groove, ploughing the territory halfway between Hitman and Call Of Duty and planting seeds by letting you shoot the bollocks off a Nazi. The next in the series was officially revealed during this week&#x27;s Game Awards, and you can find the first trailer below.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake is finally headed to PC on December 16th, as announced during The Game Awards. That&#x27;s great news, but there&#x27;s a catch: Square Enix are selling it at the next-gen console price of £65/$70/€80.

                    <span>I always liked the idea that a citybuilder eventually comes to contain several other management games within it. Cities: Skylines takes another step in that direction with its next DLC, which will let you construct sprawling airports when it takes flight in January.

                    <span>Tchia was one of the best looking game&#x27;s at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, and looked even better at this year&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase. It&#x27;s simultaneously a bit Wind Waker, a bit Breath Of The Wild, and a bit Disney. This year&#x27;s trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

                    <span>My mates and I are doing the dishes, discussing whether we’ll see the region of Noxus feature more prominently in the next season of Arcane, an animated series based on League Of Legends. In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties &amp; Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

                    <span>While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

                    <span>I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can&#x27;t really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let&#x27;s be honest: that trailer is cracking. It&#x27;s really good. And it&#x27;s so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren&#x27;t going to spectacularly boot this.

                    <span>Needs must, gentle friends, needs must, and in particular I need to once more head into the dank and dreary evidence basement of the RPS treehouse. Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven&#x27;t been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It&#x27;s about speculative biology. Oh no.

                    <span>Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we&#x27;ll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It&#x27;s a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He&#x27;s one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There&#x27;s plenty of that nonsense in Ewins&#x27; set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a motorist in south west England, chances are you&#x27;ve probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon&#x27;s Magic Roundabout. It&#x27;s a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I&#x27;m not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London&#x27;s equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham&#x27;s Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It&#x27;s the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you&#x27;ll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there&#x27;s one challenge that&#x27;s truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

                    <span>About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.

                    <span>Today, as you open the tenth door on our Advent Calendar, you are greeted by what appears to be a shining web of polished jewels, connected by glimmering silver chains. A very expensive present! But as you look closer you see that the black background isn&#x27;t the inside of a velvet box. No, that is space, and those aren&#x27;t jewels...

The trailer shows the Chief walk slowly towards a large obelisk. There’s a classic dunnn of the piano and a cool space-mushroom city. Plus lots of close ups of human faces. Honestly, it looks quite good.

                    <span>PUBG Battlegrounds is going free-to-play in January 2022. The low admission fee of zero pounds was announced at The Game Awards, which is a pretty good deal if you’re looking to participate in a battle royale that’s still very much alive and kicking. Players can also pay for Battlegrounds Plus, an account upgrade that’ll net you some extra in-game unlocks. And don&#x27;t worry, if you already own the game you&#x27;ll get that upgrade for free.

Tunic, that indie Zelda-like with a fox that you sort of thought was probably already out until I just told you it isn&#x27;t yet, finally has a release date! As announced during The Game Awards last night, we can expect it to arrive on March 16th, 2022.
We&#x27;ve been hearing about Tunic for literal years now, and its omnipresence at showcases and announceathons like The Game Awards has kept it on everyone&#x27;s radar the whole time. Feast your eyes on what will hopefully be one of the last trailers for it, until the happy day we post about a launch trailer.

If my mind were any kind of structure it would be a Lego creative box of randomly mixed bricks. Thus, like an advanced robot, I store my memory outside my body in the form of daily to-do lists that I write up every morning. Wytchwood is a to-do list game, with each item cascading into a sub-list of more things to be ticked off. The difference is, in real life, my daily to-do list only includes &#x27;make shiny lure to catch an elf and steal its shoes&#x27; on Tuesdays.

                    <span>Remember Saints Row? It&#x27;s back, in trailer form. After Volition&#x27;s reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night&#x27;s Game Awards.
The trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it&#x27;s technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game. Check out the trailer below to agree with me.

                    <span>Shortly after Telltale Games announced a game based on The Expanse at The Game Awards tonight, a group of former Telltale employees announced they too were boldly going into an interactive sci-fi story based on a TV show. New studio Dramatic Labs announced Star Trek: Resurgence, a Telltale-style game about choosing your own adventure in the world of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo. It looks hella Telltale, and they even have the digital corpse of Leonard Nimoy. But man, the Star Trek story I crave would be about downtime, not action.

I am, of course, talking about the newly announced Sonic Frontiers. The next 3D Sonic game is set to arrive late 2022, and we got our first glimpse of it at The Game Awards tonight.

                    <span>Forspoken, a game whose name I will never pronounce correctly but was once known as Project Athia, finally has a concrete release date. Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix&#x27;s big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as &#x27;spring&#x27; and therefore doesn&#x27;t constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there&#x27;s a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.

My interest was piqued when I saw it&#x27;s being made by Monolith, the studio behind F.E.A.R. and the Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor series. Then I saw OH WAIT it&#x27;s using that wonderful patented Nemesis System which breathes personality and history into enemies? I&#x27;m in. Fully. Let&#x27;s go.

What a fab tune for a game trailer! Arc Raiders looks alright - it&#x27;s a free-to-play third-person shooter in which you and a squad of mates fight evil robots, and it&#x27;s coming out in 2022. Check out the vid below (if only to listen to a proper bop).

It&#x27;s out on March 3rd 2022, and its new Game Awards trailer certainly shows a much more vivid and eye-catching game than the one Ed and I saw in the most recent closed beta. Not only are there giant skull bosses with lasers bursting out of their eye sockets, but some of the creatures you&#x27;ll face in the Tower Of Babylon look suspiciously like Nier: Automata-style bullet-hell boys. See it all in action below.

                    <span>While horror fans wait with dread to see what Konami do with Silent Hill next, several people vital to that series have announced a new horror game of their own, Slitterhead. Revealed during The Game Awards tonight, it&#x27;s coming from Bokeh Game Studio, who are led by Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama and boast a number of other people from the Silent Hill and Siren games. Check out the announcement trailer below for some deeply unpleasant monsters rampaging in a city.

                    <span>Developers 10 Chambers Collective had a little surprise for everyone at The Game Awards tonight - their co-op horror game GTFO has launched out of early access. It first arrived in early access two years ago, and has had loads of update adding new weapons and environments since. With today&#x27;s 1.0 launch, it adds even more content too, including new environments, tools, bots, checkpoints and more. That&#x27;s my weekend plans sorted.

                    <span>A new Elden Ring trailer fresh out The Game Awards introduces the story of the new game from Dark Souls developers FromSoftware and Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. Well, I say it introduces the story, I mean it does it in a very Souls way, reeling off names like &quot;the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed&quot; without explaining anything. This seems like it would be the game&#x27;s opening cinematic so if you watch this trailer now, hey, it&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re starting Elden Ring two months early. Almost.

                    <span>During The Game Awards, Conan Exiles developers Funcom announced Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game with 4X elements that&#x27;s coming out in 2022. While Funcom are publishing the game, it&#x27;s being developed by Shiro Games, the folks who made Northgard. Check out the new trailer below, it&#x27;s rather vague, but does have some very nice sand in a very large hand.

                    <span>The actual biggest surprise of The Game Awards was the announcement of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a sequel coming a decade after Relic&#x27;s chainsword-wielding action game. Spoice Mahreen was a lovely wee stompy hack-and-slash game, capturing the chunky feeling and ultraviolence of futurefascists in a way no other 40K game had. Ultramarine boy Captain Titus will return, this time cutting into the Tyranid hordes. Check out the announcement trailer.

                    <span>Announced at The Game Awards, Rumbleverse is an upcoming third-person last-man-standing brawler published by Epic Games and developed by Iron Galaxy Games (who&#x27;ve previously worked on the Killer Instinct series, as well as the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro PC ports). I attended a hands-off preview, and it sure does look like a cartoony battle royale. The most standout thing to me was that you could put an entire cooked chicken in your pocket, or throw it at someone, so that&#x27;s something.
