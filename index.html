If you&#x27;ve been finding platformers to be a bit on the, shall we say, chill side, then you might want to keep an eye on Krimson, launching on the Switch eShop on 21 March, 2024.
Described as a &#x27;gritty, heart-pounding journey through a nightmarish hellscape&#x27;, Krimson sees you navigate a series of frankly ridiculous environments that pulse and move in time with the music. You must keep in time with the beat if you&#x27;re to survive, but judging from the trailer, you&#x27;ll also need sharp eyes to keep track of everything that&#x27;s going on.

The iconic GBA puzzle platformer, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is all set to swing onto Switch later this week. A free eShop demo has been doing the rounds for a while now, but today we have got our first impressions of what to expect from the full game.
Yes, the critics have had their say and we are here to give you the critical rundown. Before we get into that, however, let&#x27;s have a brief reminder of what we thought of Nintendo&#x27;s latest remake.

As we await for official word from Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer, Sarah Bond, and Matt Booty on what the future of Xbox will look like going forward, a cheeky social media post from the official Sea of Thieves account appears to be heavily hinting toward a multi-platform release.
Posted a day before Xbox&#x27;s big &#x27;business update&#x27;, during which it&#x27;s rumoured that Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush will be announced for Switch (with potentially a few more titles too), the account seems to be blatantly referencing Xbox&#x27;s major platform competitors.

You read the headline correctly — Hollow Knight: Silksong was officially revealed to the world five years ago today, on 14th February 2019.
The sequel to Hollow Knight, Silksong follows your rival-turned-friend Hornet, who is captured and taken to the kingdom of Pharloom, where she must escape and reach the top of the kingdom to find a &quot;shining citadel&quot;. Hornet&#x27;s adventure was originally planned as DLC for the acclaimed indie hand-drawn Metroidvania, but developer Team Cherry eventually expanded it into a full-blown sequel.

You can’t move for retro-inspired games these days, to the extent that a developer saying “Hey, this looks like an old game!” has started to feel less like a selling point and more like a hop onto a crowded, pixelated bandwagon. If you’re after something that looks a bit like a modern NES or SNES game (despite usually being the sort of thing those systems wouldn’t actually be able to handle due to their limitations), you could throw a rock at the Switch eShop and knock over about 12 of them with your first attempt.
We doff our backwards baseball caps, then, to Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore, which manages to take the overused ‘modern retro game’ concept and do something new with it. Slightly crazy, mind you, but new nonetheless.

Ok, let&#x27;s see. The original Donkey Kong first released into arcades in 1981, where it became a smash hit that also happened to introduce us to two of Nintendo&#x27;s most enduring mascots in the form of a great big agitiated ape and some springy little plumber guy. The game, in this very first incarnation, involved bounding around simple walkway platforms, dodging barrels, and moving ever upwards to smack said angry ape on his bonce before rescuing Pauline.
Fast forward to 1994 and Game Boy players are treated to an updated version of this original arcade escapade. Donkey Kong &#x27;94 (as all the cool kids called it back in the day) added some fresh mechanics that introduced a little more variety, platforming, and puzzling to proceedings, and it is this Game Boy adventure that laid the mechanical groundwork for 2004&#x27;s Mario vs. Donkey Kong on Game Boy Advance. Ok? Good. And now we have a remake of that game in the form of Mario vs. Donkey Kong on Switch.

Publisher Jandusoft has announced that Rebel Transmute will launch on the Nintendo Switch on 14 March, 2024.
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the title, it&#x27;s a pixel art Metroidvania that takea a few cues from the likes of Metroid and Axiom Verge in which you explore a vast world filled with weird and wonderful creatures that you&#x27;ll need to blast to smithereens. Lovely.

Tomb Raider I-III Remastered arrives on the Switch this week and the tech experts at Digital Foundry have already got a video up about the performance and frame rate across each system.
In case you missed it, the Switch version of this remaster runs at a native 1080p and 60 frames per second docked, and 720p at 60fps in portable mode. John Linneman of Digital Foundry notes how he did not encounter a single frame rate hiccup - so it really is a silky smooth and &quot;near perfect&quot; experience in terms of performance.

During the Switch generation, Nintendo has sometimes developed the odd title on a different engine. We&#x27;ve seen Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World and more recently Pikmin 4 utilise the Unreal Engine and now it appears the upcoming release Princess Peach: Showtime! might have also been created in Unreal.
This discovery stems from a post on social media (shared by Akfamilyhome via X), which shows the Chinese game box for Peach&#x27;s new game, and on the back of it, you can see the Unreal Engine logo:

You may have already seen our review here on Nintendo Life, but if you did miss we labelled it one of Aspyr&#x27;s most accomplished projects to date, awarding it 8 out of 10 stars.

The 3DS has had a good run over the years, but it&#x27;s at the end of its life now that Nintendo has concluded eShop sales and announced the shutdown of online play.
Ahead of the shutdown of online play in April, Nintendo&#x27;s customer support service has also revealed repairs for the system will be ending in Japan. Even though this service hasn&#x27;t been available for some time in other parts of the world, Japanese fans with certain model 3DS were still able to access this service.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been enjoying the Apple Arcade-exclusive Sonic Dream Team, you&#x27;ll have more to dig into later today. SEGA has the first content update scheduled to go live at 2:00 pm PT. 


From the looks of it, there&#x27;s a little something for those who want more from the bosses and folks who are striving to go even faster. For the former, the update adds eight new boss missions, as well as overhauls to some of the key boss fights. 


Enemies like Dr. Crabulous, the Factory Foremen, and the Guardian Hunter have all been tweaked to shake things up a bit. According to the announcement, this includes the addition of &quot;a few new moves to keep players on their toes during battle.&quot;


If going fast is your thing — and why wouldn&#x27;t it be, you&#x27;re not playing a Big the Cat platformer! — the update introduces time trials and some handy tools for speedrunners. Taking part in time trials will give you a shot at nabbing the best completion time in each Act. The results will be available on the leaderboard once recorded so you can go back to try to best yourself or everyone else, depending on how competitive you&#x27;re feeling. For speedrunners, the Sonic Dream Team update adds ranks for each Act.

Sonic Dream Team first launched on December 5, 2023, taking a swerve from the recent 2D sidescroller Sonic Superstars to deliver 3D platforming exclusive to Apple devices. Those who subscribe to Apple Arcade can give it a spin on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, and there&#x27;s more on the way at some point in the future. Sega reiterated that this is the first of three content updates, with other additions planned for sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Another week, another game-changing Call of Duty update. This week&#x27;s patch notes include plenty of welcomed fixes, changes, and content shifts. However, the big change to ranked Modern Warfare 3 game modes is the removal of all snipers. 


This is one of only two ranked-specific changes from the patch notes, the other being Sub Base Hardpoint has been temporarily removed from the ranked map pool. 


Why are snipers banned in Modern Warfare 3 ranked play?


When it comes to Call of Duty, and it doesn&#x27;t matter which version we&#x27;re talking about, the developers can&#x27;t seem to please everyone. Snipers were banned from the Call of Duty League and ranked multiplayer playlists, and everyone complained. Then snipers were allowed in both, and players still complained.

                              <span>Since being released, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fans have reported some not-so-pretty visuals when switching to Performance Mode in the newly released demo. Thankfully, it looks like some upgrades are on the way as Square Enix plans to apply some improvements to the visual quality of Performance Mode in an update rolling out on February 21.




For the most part, Performance Mode is always going to pale in comparison graphically to Quality Mode. After all, that&#x27;s the intent: to shed some visual quality in an effort to maintain a stable framerate, often 60 fps. However, in the FF7 Rebirth demo it felt like the quality slider went a few notches too far.


Square Enix&#x27;s post on Twitter about the upcoming update didn&#x27;t go into much detail, but it did state the improvements are also being applied to the full game when it releases in two weeks. (Yep that&#x27;s right, just two more weeks to go!) With the update coming in a week, that will give players roughly eight days to play through the graphically improved demo before Rebirth&#x27;s full release.


I personally played through the demo the first time in Quality Mode, which looked great. After hearing about the issues people were having I booted it back up in Performance Mode and have to agree, there are definitely some improvements to be made so I&#x27;m happy to see Square Enix making them.


The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo is available now on PlayStation 5. The full release of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is on February 29.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not always an easy decision when trying to choose a new graphics card. Nvidia alone recently launched three new SUPER models (not those kind) in its 4000 series. But if you want a GPU that sort of reminds you of what it was like to help your dad with household renovations, this could be right up your street.


As spotted by Videocardz, Sycom has launched an Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER. As well as mixing fans with liquid coolers, the cards come with spirit levels built onto the hardware itself. You know, those bubble-levels you use to make sure everything&#x27;s even-keel.

And I said spirit levels...because there are two of them. Presumably added on for more accurate installation, they do seem to look quite at home, particularly on the green version.


Nope, can&#x27;t think of a spirit-based pun in this context


There is one downside to this, which is it looks as though these spirit level Nvidia GPUs are only available as part of a complete package. The website shows them as part of the Sycom G-Master Hydro series, which means you&#x27;d have to buy a full system to get one.


It seems more of a novelty feature than anything, unless there are those who absolutely want to ensure precise installation. The obvious main advantage to a graphics card like this is the liquid cooling, which is said to reduce temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celcius.


With the RTX 4080 SUPER running at a TDP of 320W, those extra degrees could come in handy. But, again, it shows that the graphics hardware market is something of a minefield when it comes to choice.

                              <span>For prospective Destiny 2 players looking to pick up the game before The Final Shape releases, now&#x27;s your chance. Humble Bundle is offering a bundle called Destiny 2: The Story So Far, and it includes every expansion plus a few extras for $40. 


Player onboarding has been a sticking point for the Destiny 2 community for quite some time. While the game is technically free-to-play, that experience is limited to a few activities and some locales to patrol. The ongoing narrative and the bulk of Destiny 2 content are behind expansion and season paywalls, naturally making it a nightmare for new players to navigate.


If players opt for the $40 tier of the bundle, they&#x27;ll get access to all of the playable content currently in the game. That includes: 



Shadowkeep 


Beyond Light


The Witch Queen


Lightfall


Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack


Forsaken Pack


Lightfall Dungeon Key


Annual pass for Lightfall containing access to all Seasons 20-23 content



This removes the potential confusion of a first-time player trying to decipher which store listings contain actual content versus cosmetic items or premium currency. On top of that, Lightfall alone is usually sold for $50. The savings speak for themselves.


The cool thing is that the bundle has different tiers, too. If players don&#x27;t care about Lightfall Dungeon or seasonal content, a $20 tier offers just the listed expansions. At $12, it&#x27;s the everything preceding Lightfall. And at a measly $8, players still get a full expansion and some of the oldest Destiny 2 content still in the game, Shadowkeep and the Forsaken Pack.


As a bonus, purchasers can know that at least some portion of their funds will go to charity. For Destiny 2: The Story So Far, part of the money goes to The Bungie Foundation.

                              <span>Patch 1.3.2 just dropped in Diablo 4 which gave us a lot of bug fixes and an adjustment to the Cursed Shrine events, but the meat and potatoes of this update lie with the newly implemented Uber Unique crafting system. Yeah, that’s right; we can now “target-farm” Uber Uniqes. 


It sounds like a win on paper, essentially giving us dedicated grinders a guaranteed Uber Unique after a certain number of runs. It is, but there’s still a huge asterisk to this system introduced in 1.3.2.

To quickly run down how this system works: you can now salvage Uber Unique items to receive new materials called Resplendent Sparks. You’ll only receive one of these per Uber Unique dismantled. Once you have five Resplendent Sparks and 50,000,000 Gold, you visit an Alchemist at a Way…</span>

                              <span>As expected for anything in early access, there have been some performance issues with Palworld since day one. However, following the release of patch 0.1.4.1 (Steam) and 0.1.1.4 (Xbox), there&#x27;s a noticeable uptick in community reports of lag and disappearing floors. 


Teething issues are part of the agreement when you sign on to play something in its experimental state, and players, for the most part, have been pretty forgiving and patient as they wait for fixes. However, the Palworld subreddit has recently become a hotbed of complaints, highlighting issues that render the game almost impossible to play and even more impossible to enjoy. 




One bug appears to be affecting Xbox players in particular and renders Duneshelter entirely unusable. As soon as players arrive at the fast travel …</span>

                              <span>The creator of Suikoden and Eiyuden Chronicles, Yoshitaka Murayama, died on February 6 due to “complications with an ongoing illness,” as announced by his company, Rabbit and Bear Studios.


Murayama joined Konami back in 1992 and worked his way up to direct and write his own game, Suikoden, which was released at the end of 1995 in Japan before reaching North America in 1996. He continued working on the series through to 2002, when he left Konami a month before the release of Suikoden III. He formed Blue Moon Studios, where he worked on 2005’s 10,000 Bullets.


Recently, he was head of Rabbit and Bear Studios and was working on Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, which is set to release April 23, 2024.


The statement from Rabbit and Bear studios reads, “His hard work on Eiyuden Chronicle as scenario writer was finished but as his co-workers and friends, it saddens us to know that he won’t get to see the reactions from his fans.”


A remaster compilation for the first two games in the Suikoden series, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, is also likely to be released this year. It’s heartbreaking that he won’t be here for the release of his follow-up and the celebration of the games he helped build. We at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.

                              <span>The web-heads at Insomniac Games must be celebrating, as Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 sales have reached over 10 million copies as of February 4, 2024. The news was provided to us by Sony, who just released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter. 


“Today, we&#x27;re honored to celebrate an amazing milestone: Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 has surpassed 10 million units sold, bringing the game series sales to an astounding 50 million units!” said Insomniac Games on Twitter. “Thank you for the support and making this spectacular journey possible!”

It’s “amazing” that with just three games in the series, 50 million units have been sold.  PlayStation’s purchase of the talented studio Insomniac Games for $229 million seems to be a slam dunk with these Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 sales numbers.


Those who picked up the sequel might be happy to know there’s a big title update coming March 7. It will include New Game+, new suits to play in, and more. No other details are out yet.


The news of the game reaching 10 million units is no doubt a good win, after the trouble caused by the Insomniac Games hack late last year. Upcoming plans, development videos, and personal data were all shared from a ransom attack. Hopefully this success can help ease any lingering hurt from that.


Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 released back on October 20, 2023. Destructoid gave it a 9/10 review. “It’s abundantly clear that this series isn’t over yet, and I hope that Insomniac never really stops working on superhero games,” said our review. “There’s so much of the Spider-Man mythos that’s untapped so far, and you could keep this gravy train running with some crazier ideas once this presumed trilogy is over.”

                              <span>RPGs are having an amazing year in terms of sales, with Persona 3 Reload and Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth raking in the dough. Now, another reaches one million copies sold: Cygames’ Granblue Fantasy: Relink.




The game’s team celebrated the one million copies on X (formerly Twitter) with a sweet-looking drawing and thanked those who played. They also promise to provide more updates for the Granblue Fantasy: Relink, which includes new playable characters throughout March and April.


On a Hot Streak




Granblue Fantasy: Relink was released in the midst of some heavy-hitting games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and Persona 3 Reload. Still, it held its ground and surprised quite a lot of people with its engaging gameplay and intriguing story. A demo for the game dropped in early January, which gave the game some attention. 


It also helps that Granblue Fantasy: Relink includes multiplayer, making it a bit more sociable than your average RPG. Surprisingly, or maybe not due to its multiplayer leanings, the Steam Database shows the game outdoing Persona 3 Reload and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth in player count on that platform. For a series that’s only a decade old and started as a Japan-exclusive mobile game, it’s doing incredible.


I’ll be honest: I haven’t had the chance to hop onto the Granblue Fantasy: Relink train. I do plan to play the demo, since RPGs are some of my favorite games. I mean, its combat looks like Tales of Arise, and I know Tales of Arise. It’s right up my alley. We did have the amazing Steven Mills on the case, who gave the game an 8 out of 10. Seems like it&#x27;s a good time to get on the Granblue train.

                              <span>Recently, Eilas Toufexis, the voice behind Adam Jensen from the later Deus Ex games, posted a heartfelt goodbye to the character he&#x27;s best known for. With hopes of a new entry fading fast, the actor has since said he&#x27;s been asked to ease up when talking about the Mankind Divided and Human Revolution protagonist.


In an interview with PCGamesN, Toufexis likened the current state of the video game industry to a &quot;disaster zone.&quot; Referring to the continuing onslaught of studios shutting down, projects being shelved, and conglomerates laying staff off, the actor opines about how things are at the moment.




With regard to Deus Ex, Toufexis said he never heard anything official after 2016. Every piece of information that came to him about the franchise was &quot;unofficial, from friends or acquaintances.&quot; He also mentions how developer Eidos contacted him in 2020 to ask him to &quot;stop talking about Adam Jensen in interviews and podcasts.&quot;


Imagine giving Jensen a gag order


The response goes on to say that the reason the developer doesn&#x27;t want him talking about the character is because &quot;they wanted people to focus on other things from the studio.&quot;


Last month, it was announced that parent company Embracer Group allegedly shuttered an in-progress Deus Ex game. This was on top of 97 people being laid off, which is a headline many of us have sadly become used to seeing these past 12 months or so.


Fortunately, Toufexis is still busy with work. In a post on Twitter recently, he said he&#x27;s currently working on a couple of games, but &quot;I&#x27;d expect them all to be canceled before the end of the week or something.&quot; He adds that he&#x27;s doing fine, though: &quot;I&#x27;m very lucky to have many irons in the fire. Games are just in a weird place right now.&quot; True that.

                              <span>For good or ill, Dead Island 2 came and went without a huge amount of fanfare. Currently, the game has a Metacritic score of 73 (7.7 from users), which is pretty good, but not exactly boundary-breaking. 


However, if you missed your chance to check it out when it was released last year, here&#x27;s your chance to play it on Steam soon: On April 22, to be exact. Yeah, pretty much on the one-year anniversary of the game&#x27;s release, you can pick up Dead Island 2 on Steam, which, until now, was only available via Epic Games Store if you wanted it on PC.




Developer Dambuster really wants to make sure you don&#x27;t forget about its sequel, so to celebrate the re-release (let&#x27;s call a spade a spade), the studio is offering discounts on the other entries in the series.


Weird how zombie games are still a thing these days


As well as being able to wishlist the new game, Dead Island Definitive Edition and Retro Revenge are currently 85% and 75% off, respectively. Additionally, Riptide is 100% free for a limited time only. And when I say &quot;limited,&quot; I mean you literally only have until tomorrow to pick up a copy (the other two are discounted until February 20).


It was quite a tumultuous development cycle for DI2. Originally scheduled to come out in 2015 – and being made by Techland of Dying Light fame – the project passed through a number of studios before Dambuster took the reins.


Considering the first installment did not leave much of an impact, it&#x27;s surprising a sequel was even green-lit. By this point, you&#x27;d think everyone would have been sick of the zombie genre by now. Evidently not.


But say what you will about the first Dead Island, that trailer still packs a punch to the gut to this day. It&#x27;s just a shame the actual game content didn&#x27;t match the marketing.

                              <span>It seems that whenever something becomes popular, AliExpress isn’t far behind and knock-off merchandise can be ordered across the globe. Palworld, it seems, is no exception to this law of the internet and this has frankly terrifying consequences.


It should come as no surprise to anyone that AliExpress vendors have latched onto Palworld as though it’s the lifeblood they’ve been needing. From stickers to plushies and everything in between, it seems that you can get any unofficial Palworld merch you could ever want on there. I know this because I downloaded the App and fell into a very strange wormhole.


Among the most popular items currently available on AliExpress are Palworld clothes. Hoodies, shirts, hats, and pajamas are all up for grabs. However, not all of these items are something …</span>

                              <span>NIS America has confirmed the latest Ys entry for a western release date. Ys X: Nordics will arrive sometime in Fall 2024 for the PlayStation 4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch.


While it&#x27;s not surprising to see a Ys game head west, it is reassuring to see it get dated. There&#x27;s been a gap, for most of the recent Ys titles, between the Japanese retail launch and their ports to North America. At least with this game, the wait wasn&#x27;t terribly long; Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan in September 2023 for PlayStation and Switch.


The port of Ys X will have Japanese language options, for both text and audio, on the PC. The computer launch is also hitting a number of storefronts: Steam, Epic, and GOG.

                              <span>It’s dangerous to base an entire game, movie, book, or anything on a single joke – especially a referential joke. Yet the developers of Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore did exactly that.


The Phillips CD-i Legend of Zelda titles are many things, including a rare besmirchment on the brand and a laughing stock, but they’re rarely referred to as quality games. For some reason, Seedy Eye Software (oh, I just got that pun) chose those three games of questionable quality as inspiration. In particular, Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore is billed as a spiritual successor to Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.


But if they were aiming for “so bad it’s good” with Arzette, they’ve missed the mark entirely. Arzette is just plain good.

                              <span>I’ll admit, the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series is one that’s passed me by. While I enjoy 2D platformers a fair bit, and certainly love my Nintendo handhelds of yore, these puzzle-focused adventures were never really on my radar. A remake feels like a natural time to hop on and see what I’ve missed.


And to say it up front, it’s a good remake. In watching comparison videos between the old, oddly 3D-ish version on the Game Boy Advance and this new version for the Nintendo Switch, the difference is impressive. I can tell that Mario vs. Donkey Kong might have felt ahead of the curve in some ways, back then. Its puzzle-box approach to platforming certainly feels novel, as does its surprising demand for precision, timing, and understanding of how to navigate various hazards while routing a path b…</span>

                              <span>With a little over a month until the release of Dragon’s Dogma 2, director Hideaki Itsuno has confirmed that the game will run with an “uncapped” framerate on current-gen consoles.


Itsuno revealed this via his X (formerly Twitter) account, writing: &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 supports variable framerate! Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate!&quot;




It’s unclear if the game will have a locked 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance mode and then an “uncapped” setting that pushes the framerate beyond that, or if it’s simply going to fluctuate between all of these thresholds throughout. it&#x27;s likely the former case, but regardless of how you can tweak the settings, an “uncapped” framerate is a headache without a display that supports variable refresh rate, aka VRR.

                              <span>The Tomb Raider series is what got my love for video games rolling in the first place. Conversely, the trend of remastering and remaking every great game in existence — instead of boldly giving the rough ones a retry — is what&#x27;s led to me falling out of love with it once in the past.


I knew that looking at a simple remaster of the original three, and possibly best, games in a series that speaks to me so dearly after a blockbuster Tomb Raider Anniversary remake failed to capture my interest could prove a challenge, but I&#x27;m happy to announce that sometimes I&#x27;m just dumb.

And no, you don&#x27;t need to buy an expansion for it.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve eschewed any Valentine&#x27;s theming this year, but Edwin put this in our news queue last night as a sort of dare for our evening shift, and let the record show I am less of a coward than Graham Smith. The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, a visual novel Tarot-themed card game from perennial (perhaps perineal, in this case) favourites Deconstructeam, was praised by Edwin in his review, and I was going to use the same strapline for this news post had he not got there first. Because now, in time for the season of romance, they&#x27;ve teamed up with sex toy purveyors Uberrime to create a frankly prohibitively massive dildo as an official tie-in for the game, which can be won in a free competition by three lucky people living in either the UK, EU, US or Canada (as in, they each win their own dildo; they don&#x27;t have to time share).
I mean I say &quot;prohibitively&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know your life.

                              <span>A number of Ubisoft France employees are on strike today after the collapse of union negotiations with Ubisoft management, who have reportedly proposed a budget for wages &quot;that would be lower than inflation for the second year in a row&quot;. The strikers are calling it a &quot;badly balanced rewards system&quot;. Cheeky devils!
The news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.

                              <span>When it comes to co-op shooters and most other multiplayer games, it&#x27;s often the case that friendly fire is switched off by default or there are endless systems in place to make it a punishable offence. In Helldivers 2 it isn&#x27;t actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.
But comedy isn&#x27;t just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.

                              <span>Granblue Fantasy: Relink is a JRPG that is ticking off many of the action RPG tropes. It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.
In practice, though, you sort of can&#x27;t be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It&#x27;s built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don&#x27;t take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I&#x27;m not selling it as such, but it&#x27;s actually charming.

If you missed it, the trailer in question focuses on the &quot;modernised&quot; combat. It shows alleged &quot;everyman&quot; protagonist James Sunderland getting all Gears of Warry with some maggoty marionettes and rancid demon nurses.

                              <span>February&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza officially concluded on Monday, and Valve have now revealed the 50 most played games you all tucked into across the week-long event. Ordered by the number of unique players that spent time with them during Next Fest proper (meaning all those early demo plays from earlier in the month haven&#x27;t been counted), the most popular game of the lot was one that was only formally announced right at the end of January. So congratulations Dungeonborne - your blend of PvPvE dungeon crawling and fantasy skelly monsters clearly struck a chord with this year&#x27;s Next Festers.

                              <span>By now you&#x27;ll probably have read quite a bit about our preview adventures in Inflexion Games&#x27; upcoming fantasy survival adventure Nightingale - including our slightly raucous attempts to interview CEO Aaryn Flynn while instant KO-ing tree monsters and abusing our supplies of ice bullets. But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale&#x27;s particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.
With so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft &#x27;em up. I swear, I don&#x27;t think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore? Join us as we discuss some of its finer points below.

                              <span>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a delicious piece of mad science: what if you spliced the ale-sodden DNA of Deep Rock Galactic’s dwarven miners with tissue samples from a Vampire Survivors-like autoshooter?
It shouldn’t work, surely. It would be easy to look at this spin-off and question why it takes the co-op out of one of the best co-op games on PC, or to shovel it aside as a cynical attempt at latching onto the popularity of autoshooters/Survivors-likes/bullet heavens (delete as preferred). But you’d be a smooth-handed leaf lover, my friend, as not only does DRG’s mix of horde shooting and rock smashing translate remarkably well to the format, even this early access version is heaps of subterranean fun.

Over the past week the devs have deployed server hotfixes and matchmaking tweaks, although one server and rewards patch had to be rolled back to fix &quot;significant&quot; performance issues. Still, they&#x27;re doing their utmost as the game becomes PlayStation&#x27;s biggest PC release to date. And the latest patch brings with it a slew of crash fixes, reductions to disconnects, further tweaks to matchmaking, and preps things for future server improvements.

                              <span>In the event that I walk in front of a particle accelerator, get converted into digital data and am promptly isekai-ed into a gameworld, I hope that gameworld is the opening port town from the original Grandia, released on PS1 way back in 1997 (and ported to PC in 2019). There&#x27;s something about that game&#x27;s isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways. Bliss. I can still hear the seagulls blowing around the screen. 


Oh sorry, I rhetorically lost myself for a minute there! I&#x27;m supposed to be telling you about Terra Memoria, a new RPG featuring time travel, magic crystals and animal wizards. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>The Fantastic Four finally arrive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe next year, and Marvel Studios has officially revealed who will don the team’s iconic blue suits.

Pedro Pascal has been on a roll lately, starring as Joel in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us, portraying the titular Mandalorian in The Mandalorian, and starring in films such as The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and the upcoming Gladiator 2. Vanessa Kirby made her name portraying Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, most recently played Joséphine in Ridley Scott&#x27;s historical epic Napoleon, and has appeared in the recent Mission: Impossible films as Alanna. Stranger Things season 4 fans know Joesph Quinn best as the season&#x27;s breakout character, Eddie Munson. Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been known as Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Jerimovich in the FX series The Bear and as Arvel Skeen in the Star Wars series Andor. 
WandaVision director Matt Shakman will direct The Fantastic Four, though its story details remain scarce. The Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.</span>

                              <span>Ys X: Nordics, the latest entry in the long-running Ys series, is making its way to the West. Nordics stars a younger version of series hero Adol Christin embarking on an adventure in the Obelia Gulf, a collection of northern islands.
He finds himself thrown in the middle of a conflict between the islands’ residents and a seafaring tribe, as well as mysterious immortal monsters called the Griegers. Adol joins a Norman warrior named Karja to sail the seas aboard a ship, including exploring an open ocean and engaging in naval combat. 


Ys X: Nordics was first released in Japan last September and will come stateside this fall. It will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.

A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game&#x27;s classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo&#x27;s 2024.
In the game&#x27;s opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds…</span>

                              <span>Magical first-person shooter Immortals Of Aveum launched last August and by the following month half its development team had been laid off due to poor sales.

In a new report by IGN on widespread industry layoffs, developers who worked on Aveum say it cost around $125 million to make and &quot;no one bought it.&quot;

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is a third-person co-op shooter that&#x27;s centred as much around action as it is comedy. Gigantic insects and red-eyed robots threaten the sanctity of Super Earth and, frankly, this isn&#x27;t on. As a Helldiver, you must team up with your compatriots and pulverise these menaces for freedom (a shoulder-mounted laser cannon) and democracy (an aerial bombardment). Seriousness is reserved for the act of extermination, which adds tactility to the familiar motions of a shooter, making for horde management that promotes efficiency and frequent lapses of judgement in equal measure. Helldivers 2 is a slapstick masterpiece.

The issue of course, is that in real life, if forced to live in a space the size of the interior of a camper van, I would pile things on every surface within about 12 hours. Chaos would reign. I would hate it. But I don&#x27;t hate the idea of it, which is why i enjoy things like Outbound, which is a game about living in a camper van.

                              <span>One of the best things in games is the freeform ability to type commands for another character, then having them respond with voiced dialogue recognising your weird directions. That&#x27;s one of the joys of Cryptmaster, an upcoming typing-driven dungeon crawler where one of the first things you can do in the demo is get your disembodied necromancer pal to lick a mysterious metal object to help identify it (it&#x27;s a helmet). He&#x27;s like if Hand Of Fate&#x27;s dastardly dealer was a bit of a dingus and also your only hope of escaping the underworld. I love this guy.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest may be over for another few months, but dozens of demos are still alive and kicking, it seems - which is good news for me, who still has a good half dozen on my to do list, and also good news for you, as it means you still have time to check out the really quite good demo for Stand-Alone, a fast, 2D hack and slasher where you play as a robot-powered sheep packing a very large sword. Wolves have broken into your home and murdered all your friends, but you play as the one sheep who got away - or rather, a sheep that&#x27;s been fused with a surprisingly powerful robot capable of producing a honking great greatsword to make their escape with. Thus begins the wolves&#x27; hot pursuit - not least because this robot also seems to be kind of sleeper agent for them - and your roguelike-shaped quest to avenge your fallen friends.

                              <span>Hey, you know that idea for an RPG you&#x27;ve been kicking around your head for years now? Maybe it&#x27;s time to give it a crack. Right now on Steam you can grab a free copy of RPG Maker XP, an older version of the wildly popular (and quite accessible) game-making tool. It might be fun to kick around an idea or—who knows—maybe you&#x27;ve even got the next To The Moon (made in RPG Maker XP, don&#x27;t you know?) rattling around up there, waiting to manifest.

                              <span>Former Dead Cells lead designer Sébastien Benard is none too chuffed about publisher Motion Twin&#x27;s decision to end development of the well-regarded roguelike Metroidvania. A few days ago, Motion Twin announced that the 35th major Dead Cells update, aptly titled The End Is Near, would be its last. Benard feels this is a betrayal of both the game&#x27;s community and its current development team, Evil Empire, a spin-off studio who took the reins in 2019.

                              <span>Boomer shooters, retro FPS games, whatever you want to call them. They&#x27;re popular on Steam, and for a good reason: they&#x27;re loads of fun. But what if you stepped back into a classic &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s anime, with big guns and an even bigger need for speed? 


In Mullet Mad Jack, the gunplay will feel familiar but other mechanics are very unique. Hammer95 Studios&#x27; heart-pounding and action-packed roguelike shooter had a demo as a part of Steam Next Fest, and it catapulted its way into my heart and onto my wishlist.


The 10-second kill timer is terrifying





The best part of Mullet Mad Jack might be the story. There&#x27;s a perfectly good explanation for why you&#x27;ll die if you don&#x27;t get kills: your viewers will be angry. You&#x27;re live-streaming yourself the entire time, and you literally live fo…</span>

                              <span>Paradox Interactive has announced that they’ll be handling publishing duties for XperimentalZ Games’ Escape the Mad Empire under their Paradox Arc (alternative game publishing) label. It’s set to launch into early access sometime this year.


Escape the Mad Empire has been quietly in development for quite a number of years now. However, with that sweet, sweet PR budget, there’s now a nice new trailer for us to watch and a demo to play. Both of these outline the unique action/strategy mix that is put to use.




I played a bit of the demo since I wasn’t able to fully grok the gameplay based on the trailer. While Escape the Mad Empire is a loot-heavy roguelite, you control a party of adventurers. However, this isn’t a turn-based affair. The action plays out in real time. However, to enable you to control multiple peeps, you can use tactical pause to stop time, and issue commands that instantly get carried out when you unpause.


It’s a neat little system that keeps things moving while also giving you the ability to pull off big attacks against hordes of enemies. There&#x27;s also a cover system that encourages movement, so your spellcasters don&#x27;t have to stand out in the open like dumbasses. I haven’t played past the tutorial in the demo, but it leaves a good first impression.


Escape the Mad Empire is planned to launch into Early Access sometime in 2024. The demo is available now.

                              <span>The hype train for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already left the station with the surprise launch of a demo earlier this month. Before pulling into the final station on February 29, 2024, Square Enix is making a quick stop for Valentine&#x27;s Day. After all, what says love like subconsciously stealing the identity of a girl&#x27;s dead, but now not dead, boyfriend while also being oblivious to the affections of your childhood friend?


Who are you inviting to the Gold Saucer with these Final Fantasy 7 Valentine&#x27;s cards?


In a February 13, 2024, post on X (formerly Twitter), the Final Fantasy VII account made a series of Valentine&#x27;s cards available. Each card features one of the nine party members with an obligatory appearance by everyone&#x27;s favorite villain with mommy issues, Sephiroth.


The cards themselves harken back to a time when I would purchase a box of Batman or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cards to hand out in elementary school. Each of the 10 cards features a high-quality render of the character with a delightful pun professing your adoration for the recipient. Suddenly I&#x27;m wondering who would get each character and which card best describes my feelings for my real crush. I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter as a nearly 40-year-old man who will just print them all out and dump them on my wife&#x27;s desk.

Feel free to click on any of the images above to download whichever strikes your fancy. Even if you won&#x27;t be handing them out in class, you can always set them as a phone wallpaper to celebrate the holiday and remind you why you need to save the planet from Sephiroth.

The latest in Atlus and Vanillaware&#x27;s series of videos detailing Unicorn Overlord&#x27;s many systems dives into training. Specifically, we get some idea of what it means to level up a unit, promote them, and how to keep everyone up-to-snuff for the coming engagements.

It typically consists of a few Create-A-Sim (CAS) or build items between their major pack launches. The highlight of the latest The Sims 4 SDX, introduced on February 13, 2024, features a wide array of additions to CAS in the form of new Vitiligo skin details, as part of a collaboration with supermodel Winnie Harlow. 


Vitiligo is a skin condition that causes patchy skin resulting from loss of pigmentation. Because of this, someone with darker skin may have patches of lighter skin around their body, occasionally affecting hair as well. While The Sims 4 historically has had few features to accommodate this, recent years have introduced new CAS items for various conditions. …</span>

                              <span>Can you believe it’s been about a year since Splatoon 3’s Expansion Pass became available for purchase? Until now, buyers have only had Inkopolis Plaza to provide value for their dollar, but on February 22, 2024, the Side Order campaign will release.


In anticipation of the new campaign, Nintendo has served up a solid slice of Side Order gameplay in the form of an explainer trailer. It dives into what the campaign entails, going deep into the main loop of its roguelite gameplay.




Inkopolis Square, the hub from Splatoon 2, is suffering from some pretty harsh coral bleaching and is devoid of color. Partnered with Pearl in drone form, Agent 8 (that’s you) must climb the Spire of Order to… fix it, I’m assuming.


You ascend the spire, floor by floor, collecting color chips that will enhance your abilities. Your goal is to climb the tower as far as you can before expiring. Then, you get points (pearls) for your collected chips and can use those to give Agent 8 a good buffing.


It’s pretty much roguelite trappings at their most basic. However, I can dig it. Splatoon has experimented with different approaches to turn its competitive focus into a single-player experience, and the typical campaign format tends to leave me a bit cold. While I’m not a huge fan of the roguelite formula, I think that, as an excuse to play by your lonesome, it can work in Side Order. Plus, I’m digging the more muted color palette that the expansion has. It really contrasts the usually bright inks of the main game.


Splatoon 3 is available on Switch. The Expansion Pass is already available, but the Side Order campaign portion of it will launch on February 22, 2024.

                              <span>Patch 6.57 for FFXIV dropped in the early hours of February 13, bringing a host of updates in preparation for the upcoming Xbox open beta, lifted raid restrictions, and better A Realm Reborn quest rewards. It&#x27;s not a big patch, but it&#x27;s one worth mentioning.


Savage Raiding restrictions lifted


The biggest change with Patch 6.57 is the Anabaseios: Savage restrictions have been lifted, so you can now farm the raids to your heart&#x27;s content. Two Treasure Coffers now always appear after a clear, regardless of previous completion by players, while players can now proceed directly to any Circle, whether or not they’ve completed previous circles. 


Additionally, parties are granted the Power of the Echo, giving a slight boost to groups to complete the Duty. Sadly, the Echo will not increase in…</span>

                              <span>D4 Enterprise has made good on its promise, and the original PC-88 version of Ys is being released on Switch as part of their EggConsole line. It releases on February 15, 2024. Don’t get too excited just yet.


We had already heard the D4 planned on releasing Ys on console, but it was uncertain how they would navigate the licensing issues around the series in North America. Furthermore, PC-88 Ys was never translated and released in North America on account of the PC-88 being a largely Japan-only home computer. Would they really put in the effort to translate the game?


No.

EggConsole Ys is still entirely in Japanese. While the emulation shell that fits it is in English, the game itself, including all the dialogue, is still in its native language. That’s, um, quite the barrier.


I appreciate that D4 Enterprise is releasing these games in Western markets, but I’m not sure that an RPG entirely in Japanese is going to be useful to many people over here. It interests me, but I already know some of the language and have a passion for retro games. I’m currently slowly working through Legend of Xanadu on PC-Engine CD with my limited vocabulary. However, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that while I can find plenty of people online with interests like mine, we’re in a pretty small minority.


I’m just saying that I, personally, am grateful to have something like this available, but I feel like the market is much more limited than it would be if they went to the effort of translating. Of course, judging profitability is entirely up to D4.


For those of us in this particular niche, EggConsole Ys PC-8801mkIISR will be available on Switch on February 15, 2024.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Dark Descent is easily one of my favorite horror games of all time. While a little dated now, I still recall the first time I encountered the Grunt, the slack-jawed monstrosity with the bloodcurdling wail. Such terror. So imagine my surprise when I saw that developer Frictional Games is launching a plush of the creature.


&quot;A face not even a mother can love,&quot; goes the campaign slogan for the limited edition cuddly toy. A recent post on Steam invites you to recall your own experience of dread when you &quot;heard this guy come knocking in Castle Brennenburg.&quot;

The plush is not yet available, but the Makeship page (a website that specializes in helping people create custom memorabilia) shows the Amnesia merch smashed its crowdfunding goal. The Grunt plush is expected to begin production on March 2, with shipments beginning May 26, but we&#x27;re told they&#x27;ll be available for a limited time only.


I wonder if they&#x27;re absorbent


Last year saw the release of The Bunker, the newest entry in the terrifying Amnesia series. Frictional really brought things back to basics with this one. While the second game was more of a horror walking simulator (developed by The Chinese Room) and Rebirth didn&#x27;t do a lot with the formula, the latest one feels like a breath of fresh air.


Of course, The Dark Descent will always be the OG pants-filler for me. While it&#x27;s not aged terribly well (it was released in 2010, after all), it represented the beginning of a new era for survival horror.


I dare say that the likes of Outlast, Alien Isolation, and even Resident Evil 7 (to some extent) owe thanks to the first Amnesia game. You know what, I&#x27;m convinced. Maybe I will buy a Grunt plush. I&#x27;m starting to come round to its apparent cuteness.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s recent investor meeting revealed unannounced information about the arrival of XDefiant. The shooter is slated to release sometime during the company&#x27;s fiscal fourth quarter, which ranges from January to March 2024. As a result, the new shooter could be available sooner than most may have anticipated.


When is the XDefiant release date?


According to Ubisoft&#x27;s recent third-quarter sales update, XDefiant will be available sometime before March 31. Listed along with nine other Ubisoft titles as an upcoming digital release for the current quarter, this is the first we&#x27;ve seen of a release window for the shooter. It&#x27;s listed as &quot;XDefiant: Season 0,&quot; which tells us it could be considered early access.


The update says XDefiant will come to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Other titles …</span>

                              <span>Looking for something to scratch that retro role-playing game itch, but don&#x27;t want to purchase a brand-new game? Well, if you&#x27;d rather make your own, you can always check out the expansive list of RPG Maker toolkits, which are currently on sale.


Beginning yesterday, the RPG Maker Festival 2024 goes on for the rest of this week, boasting a load of software that&#x27;s got some pretty hefty discounts on Steam at the moment.




You can get VX, VX Ace, as well as Makers 2000 and 2003 for a whopping 90% off. If you don&#x27;t mind going back nearly 20 years, you may be interested to learn that XP is completely free for the duration of the event.


A recent post on Steam is celebrating the festival, which goes on until February 19. Not only are the toolkits themselves on sale, but some of the top releases made in RPG Maker are also included, such as To The Moon and the indie horror hit Ib.


I&#x27;ll make my own RPG! With blackjack and [redacted]


If you&#x27;ve never tried one of these out before, and you&#x27;re interested in making your own games, they&#x27;re definitely worth checking out. There&#x27;s absolutely a ton of these stretching all the way back to 1992 (thanks, Wikipedia!)


As the name suggests, each one allows you to create your own RPG, with an emphasis on a more classic Final Fantasy look. I&#x27;ve owned a copy of VX Ace for several years now and have attempted my own in the past. 


Never actually managed to actually finish a game, mind. Projects often join the ranks of the incomplete novels that have littered many a hard drive over the years. Ah, procrastination. Thy name is Andrew.

                              <span>DC Universe Online developer Dimensional Ink Games and its publisher Daybreak Game Company have been hit with layoffs. 
According to Kotaku, Dimensional Ink lost an unknown number of senior staff, with Game Developer reporting reductions in the art, community, and narrative departments. The team is best known for developing the superhero MMO DC Universe Online. Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) has worked on several multiplayer games, including EverQuest II, H1Z1, Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside 2. The exact number of affected employees from both studios is currently unknown. 
This is, unfortunately, the latest of an alarming trend of game industry layoffs that plagued 2023 and have only intensified in 2024. Over 5,500 jobs have been cut within January alone. Last year, over 10,000 employees in the games industry or game-adjacent industries were laid off. 
Among others this year, Embracer laid off 97 employees at Deux Ex developer Eidos-Montréal, Destroy All Humans remake developer Black Forest Games reportedly laid off 50 employees, Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees across its Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, Outriders studio People Can Fly laid off more than 30 employees, and League of Legends company Riot Games laid off 530 employees.</span>

                              <span>MG Premium has won its bizarre lawsuit against pirate site Goodporn. In the early stages of the case, the Pornhub.com domain was &#x27;virtually&#x27; at stake, but Pornhub&#x27;s sister company was eventually awarded over $2.1 million in damages. The court denied injunctive relief, however, which means that there are no domain seizures or site-blocking orders.

If you&#x27;re a gamer over the age of 30 with a decent amount of disposable income, then you&#x27;ve almost certainly heard of the Quarter Arcades range. As the name suggests, these are 1/4-scale reproductions of famous coin-ops, and the company has collaborated with some of the biggest names in the business to expand its lineup over the past few years – including Namco, Taito, and Konami.
With the likes of Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Bubble Bobble in its ranks, the Quarter Arcades family can already lay claim to possessing some serious big-hitters – but the arrival of Konami&#x27;s 1989 coin-op Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will arguably take things to an entirely new level for players of a certain age.

                              <span>When old becomes new.
Not many game franchises manage to ascend to the status of ‘iconic’, but Tomb Raider is undoubtedly one of them. Despite the original trilogy being released for multiple platforms, Lara Croft quickly became synonymous with the PS1, standing toe-to-toe with Crash Bandicoot as one of the console’s mascots. Since then, of course, Lara has been practically everywhere, yet 2024 marks the first occasion the original trilogy has been fully revamped for modern audiences via Tomb Raider I-III Remastered.
We say ‘revamped’, but these are the same games you know and love from the late ‘90s, albeit with the additional expansions included for the first time on console. What developer Aspyr has done here, however, is give all three titles a much-needed lick of paint, boosting the visuals significantly while adding in an optional modern control scheme for those who might not get on with the ageing ‘tank’ controls — more on that later. Smaller additions include a surprisingly robust photo mode and health bars for boss encounters.

                              <span>It is possible... just about.
When Super Mario Bros. Wonder first launched at the end of last year, we asked you lovely lot what your controller of choice was to take on the latest 2D platformer. We listed the likes of the Joy-Con, Pro Controller and the SNES pad — heck, we even pushed the boat out and included the CRKD Nitro Deck! Basically, we thought that we had covered all bases. Surely we wouldn&#x27;t need to include any novelty NES controllers in there too, right?
Wrong.

The vertically-scrolling shmup Triggerheart Exelica is heading to the Nintendo Switch, and Red Art Games is going all out with three physical editions to accompany the eShop launch.
Originally released for the Dreamcast in 2007 after an arcade launch in 2006 (becoming one of the short-lived console&#x27;s final licensed games), the physical release for Switch will come in three variants: standard edition (which will be available at multiple retailers), deluxe edition, and collector&#x27;s edition. The latter two will be up for pre-order exclusively via the Red Art Games website.

The Mario vs. Donkey Kong remake for the Nintendo Switch is right around the corner, so what better to celebrate than to induldge in a whopping 20-second stop-motion animation from Nintendo?
This thing is short - like, really short - but it&#x27;s still reasonably cute. Posted on Nintendo&#x27;s social media channels, the animation showcases the game&#x27;s instantly-recognisable Mario toys as they... uh... work to stop an alarm clock from beeping? Hmm... If they hadn&#x27;t knocked it down in the first place, it&#x27;d be fine.

Splatoon 3: Side Order, the long-awaited single-player DLC for Splatoon 3, is just nine days away, and Nintendo has dropped an in-depth overview trailer to act as your guide for climbing the Spire of Order.
We know the gist of Side Order already — as Agent 8, you wake up in a new &quot;world of order&quot;, a grey-scale world which needs a bit more colour added to it. You need to climb the Spire of Order to figure things out, and the tower holds many, many secrets.

Yes, the latest platformer in the Donkey Kong Country sub-series is now basically old enough to sneak a tenner out of Dad&#x27;s wallet and laugh incessantly at toilet humour, which means it&#x27;s probably high time we got a new entry, right?

That movie, of course, is Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, which brings the R-rated, fourth-wall-breaking hero from Fox’s X-Men Universe into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ryan Reynolds stars and, this time, he’s…

                              <span>While there have been efforts by AMD over the years to make it easier to port codebases targeting NVIDIA&#x27;s CUDA API to run atop HIP/ROCm, it still requires work on the part of developers. The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn&#x27;t any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it&#x27;s a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this &quot;skunkworks&quot; project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.</span>

                              <span>The owners of Elden Ring developers FromSoftware have dampened hopes that long-awaited DLC Shadow of the Erdtree might release in time for the soulslike’s second anniversary this month - despite recent rumours and behind-the-scenes Steam updates indicating otherwise.

                              <span>Twas brillig, and the RPS editors did gyre and gimble in the wabe: all mimsy were the studio executives, and the guides writers outgrabe. If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it&#x27;s a strongly British-influenced &quot;gaslamp fantasy&quot; experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.
Last week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&amp;A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.

                              <span>When I first saw Never Grave: The Witch And The Curse rising up the Steam Next Fest charts at the end of last week, I thought, &quot;Oh! That&#x27;s a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I&#x27;ll definitely give that a go.&quot; And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it&#x27;s certainly an intriguing little thing that I&#x27;ll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. 
The biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you&#x27;re a magical witch&#x27;s hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn&#x27;t so much of a surprise given everything I&#x27;ve just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair. Yep, it all makes a bit more sense now.

                              <span>&quot;Banishers took a while to kick in,&quot; I wrote in the RPS group chat last week, &quot;but I fought a monster made of angry witch-hunting jam last night.&quot; It was a pivotal boss fight about half way through Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s ghost hunting action-adventure RPG Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden, and typical of the over-the-top, slightly ridiculous, but entirely earnest drama of the game that joyfully pulls you along. Don&#x27;t Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for &quot;grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series&quot; - have followed up 2018&#x27;s third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.
Banishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I&#x27;d elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace &quot;treasure&quot; with &quot;ghosts&quot;.

                              <span>I remember reading about The Grannies a while back. They&#x27;re a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin&#x27;, tootin&#x27; cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game&#x27;s wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.
Marie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.

                              <span>The major thing Inflexion&#x27;s fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. &quot;Procgen&quot; has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we&#x27;ve all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It&#x27;s partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you&#x27;d get from a &quot;hand-made&quot; environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. 


One is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of &quot;Fae&quot; realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I&#x27;m not sure Puck will be everybody&#x27;s cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.

Made by a former Arkane level designer, it&#x27;s about a train maintenance job at a border post atop the world&#x27;s tallest mountain, where the air is so thin you need to huff top-ups from cans. Concrete information on Threshold is a bit thin at this point but I can tell you that you have a bucket and some planks, so what more do you need to know? Check out the announcement trailer, below.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is yet another example of a predominantly co-op game being a victim of its own success. Since its launch, the servers have buckled under the weight of keen conscripts ready to exterminate some bugs. There&#x27;s been frequent disconnects, matchmaking issues, and post-game rewards not showing up for some folks. But Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt has offered some comfort, saying that they&#x27;ve popped three hotfixes live to fix some of these issues.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the middle of February, and the games are afoot. This week brings at least one major news event in the shape of a &quot;business update&quot; from Microsoft about &quot;our vision for the future of Xbox&quot;, which is widely rumoured to be the announcement that first-party Xbox titles will come to rival consoles. Why is this of interest to us, a PC gaming site? Well, because console gaming can&#x27;t help but shape the weather for PC gaming; more specifically, Microsoft&#x27;s alleged multiplatform ambitions seem to reflect the plateauing of Game Pass subscription growth, which has become the cornerstone of the Xbox biz.

                              <span>Ultros is one of those games that&#x27;s born to stick in the memory. Not only is it one of the most visually vibrant games of the year so far with its neon colour palette that&#x27;s an instant-KO-to-my-eyeballs, but the way it twists and rewires core tenets of the Metroidvania rulebook also make it one of the boldest and most daring examples of its genre. I&#x27;ll say it now: it doesn&#x27;t always stick the landing. But if there&#x27;s one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.

                              <span>We’ve all been there. You see a chair in a game. It prompts you to sit. Curious, you oblige. 
Your digital butt meets the seat, and…nothing. You just sit and stare for a few seconds before rising and continuing your adventure. More often than not, sitting does not result in a cutscene, reward, character dialogue, or, in some cases, even a good view of your surroundings. You just sit. 
You could be slaying a mighty dragon.
You could be rescuing your captive friends.
You could be discovering the true meaning behind your existence and your place in the cosmos.
But instead, you sit. 
With some exceptions, taking a seat in games equates to a whole lot of nothing. And yet, it remains a regularly recurring mechanic. So why do we sit? Do you like to sit? How long do you sit? Should sitting still be a thing in games? Please take a seat and discuss your stance in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Last week, amid rumors about Xbox exclusives coming to other platforms, Phil Spencer announced an event that would detail the future of Xbox. While we&#x27;re no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot;: the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern

The podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. 
There are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn&#x27;t the case.
The other topic on the table is the company&#x27;s most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it&#x27;s a viable point of discussion.
When the podcast is posted on Thursday, you&#x27;ll be able to listen to it on Xbox&#x27;s YouTube channel right here.

                              <span>Last week, Xbox head Phil Spencer announced a “Future of Xbox” event, which we now know is taking place on Thursday, February 15. Speculation has run rampant about what the event entails amid rumors that several first-party Xbox title are making their way to other platforms, with some believing this event will confirm those reports. On the extreme end, others believe Spencer may announce the end of Xbox as a console platform altogether. According to one report, that may not be the case.
Inverse journalist Shannon Liao reported in her weekly gaming newsletter that Spencer held a company town hall last Tuesday and told employees there are no plans to stop making Xbox consoles. Furthermore, it was stated that “Xboxes would continue to be part of a strategy that involves multiple kinds of devi…</span>

                              <span>The first Tomb Raider was released in 1996, nearly 30 years ago, and in a few days, developer/publisher Aspyr is bringing the original trilogy back with some much-needed upgrades. The controls have been modernized and the games look better, but thankfully, the original versions of the three games are available as part of the package as well. Join Brian Shea and me as we check out the first levels of the three games, discuss what works about them, and where there are some shortcomings.
Tomb Raider I-III Remastered releases for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch on February 14.

                              <span>A couple of weeks ago, Hideo Kojima announced that he was returning to the action espionage genre with a new game, codenamed Physint. 

In the latest episode of his YouTube series, HideoTube, Kojima says that returning to the same genre as Metal Gear was inspired by players asking for it &quot;every day on social media&quot;, and by a brush with death he experienced in 2020.

Well, I say &quot;good snow&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t great. It quickly turned to sleet in many places and was carried by monstrous gusts in others. I likely would have ended up sodden and sullen halfway up a hill. But what if...! Ah well, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>With the recent Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Hideo Kojima&#x27;s iconic tactical espionage action franchise has been on our minds. And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.
We will get back to Majora&#x27;s Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It&#x27;s a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.

                              <span>Whenever a Mario Kart entry arrives, it immediately becomes a must-have on its respective platform, thanks to its universal appeal to gamers of all experience and ability levels. That widespread appeal has translated to sales, as nearly every Mario Kart game ranks near the top of its platform&#x27;s sales chart. But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you&#x27;re spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. 
Sure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it&#x27;s never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line.

You generally don’t stay quiet about that stuff when the news is great. And new data seems to indicate what we all suspected: The Xbox Series X/S is getting shellacked by the PS5, with…

                              <span>In the first four decades of the Super Mario series, Mario and his friends appeared in hundreds of titles, but in the core &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, the plumber was present in just 22 titles (if you include Lost Levels, Bowser&#x27;s Fury, and Super Mario Run). While the series has some entries that are stronger than others, the Super Mario series doesn’t have a bad entry to date, so this list proved difficult to put together in an order we all felt comfortable with.
In 2018, we ranked the top 300 games of all time in our 300th issue. While that list was more about ranking games in terms of quality, importance to the industry, and cultural relevance, this list is just about our favorite games. So check out our rankings of the 22 core Super Mario games below!

                              <span>Every RPG faithful has that formative experience that turned them into a lifelong fan. But what if you could experience it again for the first time? Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.
While 1990’s Ys I &amp; II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise.

                              <span>Helskate is a rogue game where you are trying to escape Hell on a skateboard. The game is heavily inspired by the Tony Hawk series, which makes sense as its game director, Steve Swink, worked on Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground. Join me and Game Informer&#x27;s resident Tony Hawk expert, Blake Hester, as we play a bit of the game, discuss its Tony Hawk overlap, and what sets it apart.
Helskate is entering early access on February 15.

                              <span>Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.
The developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer&#x27;s full statement below.
After 5 years of service, we&#x27;re hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We&#x27;re extremely proud of our work on countless updates &amp; DLC, but now it&#x27;s time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...

Along with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, &quot;The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we&#x27;ll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!&quot; while also wishing luck to Motion Twin&#x27;s next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.

                              <span>Mapleton, Utah, is one of the most idyllic cities imaginable. Its crime rate is 80% below average, and its council operates with complete transparency. Public meetings are streamed live on YouTube, and details of every meeting appear on the city&#x27;s website. That&#x27;s also how we know that the council inexplicably approved a pirate IPTV scheme for residents and local businesses, that would unwittingly render itself an illegal subscription reseller set to profit from them all.

                              <span>My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony&#x27;s dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it&#x27;s like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it&#x27;s great. 
But one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is &quot;probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don&#x27;t want it to be that.&quot; Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today&#x27;s PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.

                              <span>When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I&#x27;m not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.
Some games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of &quot;living, breathing&quot; environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, &quot;gardenvania&quot; - which launches next week.

It&#x27;s been a pretty great run as these things go: over the course of seven years, Dead Cells has received four major DLC expanions, a mobile release and, of course, 35 of those big title updates. However, current custodians Evil Empire are now moving on to greener, &quot;secret projects&quot;-flavoured pastures - the emphasis being on pastures plural there, if their Xweet about it is anything to go by, too.

Each visit to a planet lasts as long as the song, whisking us through scenes reflecting the lyrics and mood, rendered with a mix of 3D computer art and a range of handmade physical mediums. I was delighted from the first twang. And impressively, it&#x27;s mostly the work of one developer, Claire Morwood. Do have a look!

My eyes are still reeling from the gloss and glitz and pulsating lights of the Steam Next Fest demo, and I welcome this pain.

                              <span>In an upsetting confirmation that February is in fact winter (and that the year doesn&#x27;t just start with summer like my brain thinks it should) publisher Whitethorn Games held a 2024 Winter Showcase, where they revealed the existance of a game that answers the question &quot;what if the slimes in Slime Rancher were in mortal peril, and had swords?&quot;. The answer is apparently &quot;be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike&quot;. I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn&#x27;t have a release window yet.
You know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love. I am heartened to know it is coming out really quite soon - April 9th. A mere two months from now!

                              <span>One-Punch Man is a manga, anime and nowadays, videogame series that began life as a webcomic in 2009 - a drawing exercise for budding artist &quot;One&quot; that found popularity and evolved into a full-bore parody of the shonen action genre. One-Punch Man himself, aka Saitama, is essentially a NEET Superman - an apathetic homebody in yellow pants and red wellies who begins his story as the most powerful superhero in existence, for reasons unexplained.

                              <span>First spotted when James and Liam (RPS in peace) covered the PC Gaming Show 2023, Mullet Mad Jack is a roguelike FPS with a Steam Next Fest demo out right now. And my goodness me, it rules. The retro anime aesthetic is cool, sure, but I particularly love its setup, which forces you to blast through corridors as fast as you possibly can. Yeah, this is extremely a bit of Edders, and it&#x27;s gone straight on the wishlist.

The patches won&#x27;t stop, either. In a 2024 roadmap, its developers have outlined two further free updates still to come, as well as confirming that paid DLC is in the works.

After selling out rapidly, Newegg has restocked and is offering the same deal again, giving you a second chance to get a PSU that could well outlast every other component in your system! 
To get the quoted $160 price rather than the standard $220, you&#x27;ll need to use code YPCDP6233 at the checkout!

Developers Arrowhead say they&#x27;re working on a hotfix to address the issues as fast as possible.

                              <span>In a financial report released today, Ubisoft said they intend to release Star Wars Outlaws in 2024. That was already expected. More interesting is that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Codename Red, the stab &#x27;em up set in feudal Japan, is also due to launch in the &quot;fiscal year 2025&quot;. That&#x27;s also known as &quot;before March 2025&quot;, for all you non-CEOs.

                              <span>The success of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is a double-edged sword for other CRPGs launching in its wake. On the one hand, there&#x27;s arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you&#x27;re going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games&#x27; co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own &quot;repercussions&quot;, says Nitescu, but he&#x27;s confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration.

                              <span>Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it&#x27;s a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from &quot;literally about 3 ever made&quot; to &quot;does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter&quot;. Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that&#x27;s probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It&#x27;s more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense &quot;survive the ordeal&quot; narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.
But it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I&#x27;m just not sure what it really has to say.

                              <span>In survival games, I leave the building to everyone else, or I build the absolute bare minimum unless I really enjoy the world I&#x27;m in. I think that&#x27;s a thing inherent in me, as I&#x27;ve never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.
But I like Neal Agarwal&#x27;s Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;fire&quot; combine to make &quot;steam&quot;, with what&#x27;s practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable. More games should facilitate haphazard engineering and silliness.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long been enamoured with the landscape of the Pacific Northwest, from the Douglas firs and waterfalls of Twin Peaks to the redwoods I once swam beneath on a road trip. Thanks to Pacific Drive&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo, I have now also barrelled through the woods and backroads of a spooky alt-history PNW in a banged-up car which is itself a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-esque artifact. I&#x27;ve had my eye on Pacific Drive for a few years and after playing the demo, I am delighted by parts of it but not entirely sold on its roguelikelike survival scavenge-o-rama structure. Hmm! Give it a go and tell me what you think.

                              <span>This week The Electronic Wireless Show podcast is a bit shorter because I accidentally stopped recording in the middle of it, and then had to sort of restart. Though movie magic you will never know the difference, except I just told you. Oh no! Anyway, with the Steam Next Fest ongoing, I noticed an uptick in games and demos for games that are just about making a nice diorama, and have no goals or real restrictions. Interesting! I ask my co-hosts why they think this is, if that even makes a game a game, is making your own play less fun if you&#x27;re not breaking someone else&#x27;s rules, and so on. Plus: we reveal why James was in LA before!

                              <span>Elias Toufexis, voice actor for Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided&#x27;s cyborg protagonist Adam Jensen, has bid a formal &quot;goodbye, but hopefully not farewell&quot; to the character, expressing hopes that somebody with a lot of money will buy the license and restore poor moody Adam to our screens. Toufexis also shared a few parting speculations about the unannounced Deus Ex sequel from Eidos Montreal that was reported cancelled last week. Toufexis wasn&#x27;t involved with this one, and according to him, it likely wasn&#x27;t a continuation of Jensen&#x27;s story from Mankind Divided.

                              <span>Not to denigrate either the efforts of either the comms or dev teams, but when a game has been knocking around my consciousness for a while, eventually I just move it it from a mental box marked &quot;in development&quot; to &quot;probably out now, innit&quot; without any input from anyone else. Inkulinati, a turn-based strategy game where you play a medieval artist duking it out with another artist on the pages of an illuminated manuscript, is one such. It&#x27;s been kicking about on Steam since at least 2019, and in fairness to me it did launch in January last year - it just went into early access. These factors contributed to me being sort of surprised at the reveal of the actual release date for 1.0, which is February 22nd.

                              <span>Continuing their great prank of pretending they plan to release Skull And Bones, Ubisoft today launched an open beta for their multiplayer open-world pirate boat game. The free beta will run until Sunday night, after which Ubisoft will presumably delay the game for another seventeen years while once again redesigning the whole thing. When you buy your great grandniece Skull And Bones for her 17th birthday, you&#x27;ll be able to tell her you were there for the mythical open beta of &#x27;24.

                              <span>Homeworld 3&#x27;s release date has been pushed back from March 8th to May 13th 2024, in order to build on player feedback to this week&#x27;s Steam Next Fest War Games demo, which will be available till February 12th, 10am PT or 6pm GMT. The associated joint statement from developers Blackbird Interactive and publishers Gearbox arrived within hours of me posting about said Homeworld 3 demo and saying that while I am fully onboard with many aspects of the new space strategy game, I do have reservations about its controls. 


Naturally, and self-flatteringly, I&#x27;m now petrified that I&#x27;m single-handedly responsible for the delay. Please come back, Homeworld 3! I didn&#x27;t mean it! I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll acclimatise to the control scheme with practice! True-3D starfleet management is always a bit fiddly! Besides which, I might not get to review it now!! I&#x27;m moving flat in May!!!

                              <span>Elden Ring is a colossal action RPG, home to dozens of characters and intricate regions. And as someone who struggles to draw a smiley face at the best of times, my attempts to draw a dragon would result in FromSoftware rolling into my house and kicking me in the shins. Well, that won&#x27;t be happening with Artyz Artifacts, who only deserves applause for chronicling his entire Elden Ring playthrough through a series of very good sketches. It is, perhaps, the most diabolical amount of effort put into something that I&#x27;ve ever seen.

                              <span>Lenovo&#x27;s Legion Go is the most powerful and specced out PC handheld we&#x27;ve seen yet, with a mammoth 8-inch 1600p 144Hz screen, Z1 Extreme chipset and detachable controllers - one of which turns into a pseudo-mouse for FPS action. The Legion Go debuted at £699, a price at which we found it largely compelling, but now it&#x27;s dropped to something a bit more reasonable - £649. 
That £50 discount doesn&#x27;t make it a budget option by any means, especially with the most affordable Steam Deck at £349 and an OLED model at £479, but it&#x27;s still a welcome price drop on one of the most intriguing PC handhelds we&#x27;ve seen yet.

                              <span>League Of Geeks&#x27;s remake of cult strategy game Solium Infernum is having its release date pushed back by a week, the studio have announced. It will now launch on February 22nd, instead of its original date of February 14th - which is a damn shame, if you ask me, as nothing screams &quot;romantic Valentine&#x27;s night-in&quot; like trying to backstab your other half in a bid to rule hell in Satan&#x27;s absence. Alas, we&#x27;ll just have to make do with the altogether more pedestrian date of a regular Thursday in February, as the team need just a bit of extra time to ensure it&#x27;s &quot;as polished as possible&quot; before release.

Instead of focusing on anonymous Redditors, filmmakers can go after the ISP&#x27;s subscribers directly.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s symbiotic relationship between content providers and ISPs, often includes the latter selling access to partners&#x27; entertainment products. That&#x27;s a far cry from the situation two decades ago when very little content was made available online and ISPs&#x27; customers were viewed as the enemy. In a recent interview, an ISP that fought for seven years to prevent the imposition of piracy filtering and blocking said it&#x27;s ready to cut pirate IPTV streams as quickly as the law allows.

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has had a rough road following the early success of the first game. That game, which easily earned Game Informer&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year&#x27;s release of Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn&#x27;t make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.

Originally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It&#x27;s been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don&#x27;t hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.
To put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo&#x27;s quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.

                              <span>Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it&#x27;s April 2.
For Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.
Crunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.
Alongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer&#x27;s TikTok account.
As a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don&#x27;t look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.</span>

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog Movie spinoff series, Knuckles, is premiering April 26, and ahead of its streaming debut, Paramount has released a trailer. The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski&#x27;s (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor &#x27;The Hound&#x27; Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they&#x27;re sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.
Other interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey.


The series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+. For more on the Sonic the Hedgehog Movie universe, you can read our review of the second film here.</span>

The first teaser trailer for Harold Halibut was released seven years ago and was only a minute and a half long, but it immediately grabbed my attention. The footage showed a stop-animated Harold (or what looked stop-animated) cleaning up graffiti in an underwater facility. The striking visuals inspired a thought I don’t often have – how did they do that? It was my first question for game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu when I recently spoke with them.


“We actually started with the idea of wanting to make a stop motion game,” Tillmann says while citing that the first steps he and …</span>

The game continues to impress with each passing look, earning its spot as the &quot;Most Anticipated Game&quot; at The Game Awards 2023.
The world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is broken into various regions, which seamlessly blend into one another. After the intro sequence, players enter into the Grasslands, a grassy area south of Midgar. From there, you travel to Junon, a vast open area in the shadow of Shinra&#x27;s military; this area also features chocobos that can climb up cliffsides. The game also includes Corel, which features the touristy beach town of Costa del Sol, the massive playground known as Gold Saucer, and the dusty portion of the region to…</span>

It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time playing, seeing, talking about, and writing about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Having traveled to Japan to spend two days in Square Enix&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters with demos and interviews, then reporting on it through our previous issue&#x27;s cover story and subsequent exclusive coverage hub, I already had an idea that I would be a fan of what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, brings to the table. However, after coming out of the hours-long gameplay session and another conversation with director Naoki Hamag…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth continues to look fantastic. During today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play devoted to the upcoming exclusive title, we got a new look at various impactful scenes set to take place in this retelling of the middle portion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series. 
The footage in this trailer shows off various scenes we haven&#x27;t yet witnessed and characters we&#x27;ve seen very little of. The main thrust is Sephiroth&#x27;s quest for the Black Materia and the party&#x27;s efforts to save the world. As you might imagine, it&#x27;s all set to the amazing soundtrack fans have come to expect from the game.
You can check out this cinematic trailer below.


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives on February 29 exclusively for PlayStation 5. For more, be sure to check out our in-depth coverage hub here.</span>

                              <span>Last week, you decided by 60% to 40% that vampires are better than werewolves. I trust we will never hear of this again. Alas, I must respond to serious allegations. RPS reader Truffles commented, &quot;This is an absurd comparison, I thought this was meant to be scientific! How are we meant to decide between two completely unrelated things?&quot; You&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m failing you all. &quot;I hope next time we&#x27;re back to proper sensible comparisons,&quot; Truffles added, &quot;like instant-death bottomless pits vs. being able to reroll your build.&quot; Alright, let&#x27;s find out. What&#x27;s better: instant-death bottomless pits, or being able to reroll your build?

                              <span>After years without a new The Sims game, it seems like three are likely to land in fairly close proximity - sort of, anyway. We know that Paradox’s ambitious competitor Life By You will arrive this June (assuming no more delays), while EA’s own free-to-play evolution of the OG life-sim series - currently codenamed Project Rene rather than The Sims 5 - is probably still a while off yet. Dropping somewhere in the middle will be Paralives, the promising Patreon-funded up-and-comer led by indie dev Alex Massé, which has been given a fresh look and confirmation of a release date sometime next year.

                              <span>“I really fight being envious of Larian,” says indie RPG designer Jeff Vogel. “Or any other big company. Because everyone’s scared, everyone has hard times, and the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. I’ve had a very successful life where I’ve earned enough and gotten enough stability. And so I&#x27;m really happy with my choices. It would be awesome if I could write a big hit that everyone played, or had a big team and could do a big thing. But you know, I’m content. I’ve had enough people play my games.”

                              <span>Good news, star admirals with decent CPM! Gearbox and Blackbird Interactive&#x27;s strategy escapade Homeworld 3 has a demo on Steam. It&#x27;s been live for a few days, actually, but whether due to the bombardment of other Steam Fest goodies or my being led astray by the similar-but-nerdier Nebulous: Fleet Command, I didn&#x27;t try it till last night. The demo includes a tutorial mission, four maps and the War Games mode, a one-to-three player affair which essentially turns Homeworld into a roguelike - pitching you up against unpredictable opposition while unlocking new fleets and doling out Artifacts that augment your vessels.

                              <span>The latest Counter-Strike 2 update re-introduces Arms Race, a beloved multiplayer mode from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in which players level up and are handed new guns as they moider each other, with victory going to the player who levels all the way up and performs a final knifekill.
I&#x27;ve played many variations of this mode - which was originally a mod, Gun Game - over the years in other games, and it&#x27;s always a laugh, for the simple reason that it can be tuned to allow less proficient FPS players to catch up with their brethren, by introducing less powerful or harder-to-master weapons at certain levels as &quot;speed bumps&quot;.

I love their legally distinct take on many of the biggest brands, like the &quot;Racer&quot;, which is basically a Snickers bar. Except I actually prefer the Racer! I can&#x27;t remember if it&#x27;s Aldi or Lidl that do them, but the &quot;Mini Delight&quot; chocolate sticks are also exceptional. Anyway, Armored Core. Or should I say, Exterminator? Yes, there&#x27;s an Aldi Armored Core that&#x27;s just opened up in town and it&#x27;s actually not half bad. It&#x27;s definitely not Racer good, but I applaud the effort.

He shoots sauce and says things like &quot;You just don&#x27;t cut the mustard, Batman!&quot;. Maybe when you have to put out at least one issue a month, you throw a lot of villain spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and once something does you then go about making &quot;guy who has a thing for the calendar&quot; more of a rounded character - a sinister dude with a weird backstory. Or you make him the world&#x27;s greatest wife guy.

                              <span>Square Enix showed off 20 more minutes of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth during a special State Of Play stream last night, and holy heck, they sure are bringing it with the mini-games in this one. There&#x27;s a whole Gwent-like card game called Queen&#x27;s Blood (watch out Triple Triad), dolphin ride obstacle courses, playing with Mooglets, the return of Intergrade&#x27;s Fort Condor battles, a strange bit of chicken wrangling, photographing Red XIII, frog jumping... and that&#x27;s before we even get to all the stuff at Gold Saucer. Honestly, Like A Dragon better watch out, as Rebirth is clearly making a play for its mini-game crown in this second part of Squeenix&#x27;s Final Fantasy 7 Remake project, and man alive, I&#x27;m so very here for it.

I continue to wonder how much of Palworld is deliberate satire.

This is the kind of thing you can do in Infinite Craft, a browser game in which you can seemingly craft anything, and in which it is glorious, time-stealing fun to try.

                              <span>Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don&#x27;t know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that&#x27;s what CD Projekt&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.
We may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.
We&#x27;re eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do.

                              <span>Nintendo has released its latest quarterly sales numbers, and they are overall expectedly impressive considering 2023 saw the releases of new mainline Zelda and Mario games. But Pikmin 4 and Super Mario RPG, the remake of the 1996 Super Nintendo game, also delivered some notable sales numbers.
You can find the full report here, but here are the notable highlights:
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20.28 million copies since its launch on May 12, 2023
Pikmin 4 has sold 3.33 million copies since its launch on July 21, 2023
Super Mario Bros Wonder has sold 11.96 million copies since its launch on October 20, 2023
Super Mario RPG has sold 3.14 million copies since its launch on November 17, 2023
Other highlights, found here, include Switch hardware sales, which have reached 139.36 million units. It&#x27;s also always interesting to watch the list of best-selling Switch games, which you can find here. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still king, now boasting 60.58 million units sold. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in a distant second with 44.79 million units sold and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is in third with 33.67 million units sold. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey take fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Nintendo also confirmed what we all suspected, writing in its report, &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in April, had a positive impact on sales of Mario related titles. As a result, there were 24 titles that sold over a million copies during the period, including titles from other software publishers.&quot; It also mentions in the report that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario title to date.

                              <span>Starting later this month, VPN provider AirVPN will no longer accept Italian customers. This drastic decision is a direct response to the Government&#x27;s piracy-blocking requirements, enforced through the &quot;Piracy Shield&quot; system. AirVPN says that the requirements are too burdensome, while opening the door to potential overblocking and violations of users&#x27; fundamental rights.

                              <span>The much anticipated Piracy Shield blocking system is now fully operational according to Italian authorities. The system&#x27;s first three official targets appear in legal documents and are web-based, not traditional IPTV providers as some expected. Meanwhile, an operation carried out by over 100 officers to seize contraband from an Italian prison has turned up pirate set-top boxes in prisoners&#x27; cells.

With beta 3, we’ve restored the cargo types that went missing in the sub-artic and tropical climates. We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14.

                              <span>Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we&#x27;ll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming &quot;business update event.&quot; You can see the post for yourself below.
We&#x27;re listening and we hear you. We&#x27;ve been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.
February 5, 2024
The post itself doesn&#x27;t have any concrete details on what to expect, but there&#x27;s a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox&#x27;s biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn&#x27;t give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we&#x27;ll have to wait until next week to know for sure.
For more on Xbox&#x27;s plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.

We learn how the team has gradually been auditing the core systems in Apex to trim the fat accumulated since the battle royale entered the scene five years ago and how exactly those gameplay changes affect the core player base.

                              <span>Yu-Gi-Oh is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Konami held a special event in Tokyo to commemorate the occasion. In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.
Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.</span>

                              <span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.
The Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. 


Remember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of &quot;reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.&quot;
Microsoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. 
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

                              <span>In 2022, Paramount+ finally released the first season of Halo, the long-awaited live-action adaptation of the popular video game franchise. While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox&#x27;s head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they&#x27;re taking.
According to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …</span>

                              <span>A DISH copyright lawsuit against UK-based CDN company DataCamp has ended with a settlement. The original complaint alleged that DataCamp failed to terminate &#x27;repeat infringer&#x27; customers, identified by DISH as the operators of several IPTV services. The $3m settlement subjects DataCamp to an enhanced notice-and-takedown regime with financial penalties for noncompliance. Outside the agreement, the parties still disagree on almost everything.

                              <span>The IIPA, which represents the MPA, RIAA, and other entertainment industry groups, views Vietnam as a haven for online piracy. The Southeast Asian country is considered the leading global exporter of piracy services, &#x27;home&#x27; to popular brands such as Fmovies, AniWave, 123movies, and 2embed. To tackle this problem, the country should pursue criminal convictions, IIPA says.

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach’s latest trailer is aggressively bizarre. In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. 
It’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff. They’re not easy to spot, so I took the liberty…</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>I am not reviewing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League for Game Informer (that privilege belongs to looter-shooter expert Matt Miller), and for that I am grateful. But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.
There is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.

I am not a fan of the genre Suicid…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s February, which means Steam Next Fest is upon us! If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! 
Game Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That&#x27;s why in today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. 
Check out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: 


All three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you&#x27;re interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12.

Sonic Mania is widely regarded as one of the blue blur’s best games. More than six years after its 2017 release, that sentiment remains as strong as ever, even after recent outings like 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and this year’s Sonic Superstars. While published by Sega, longtime Sonic fans who grew up playing the series, like Christian Whitehead, Hunter Bridges, Dave Padilla, Brad Flick, Tom Fry, and others, led the game’s development. And without speculating too much, the degree of separation afforded to these fans-turned-developers allowed Sonic Mania to feel l…</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill: The Short Message shadow dropped yesterday following the conclusion of the PlayStation State of Play for the affordable price of free-ninety-free. The PS5-exclusive adventure follows a troubled teenager named Anita as she searches for her friend Maya in a decidedly not-okay apartment building. From the first-person perspective to psychological tricks and an oppressive atmosphere, The Short Message sports heavy P.T. vibes. If that sounds too terrifying, or if you don&#x27;t own a PS5, you can watch me play the brief adventure from start to finish in this archived live stream.

                              <span>Last year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 was a fantastic game, and the addition of a revamped Separate Ways DLC made it even better. But if you’ve been holding out on jumping into Leon’s mission to save Ashley, now may be a good time to take on Las Plagas with the announcement of Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition.


Launching on February 9, this version includes the base game, Separate Ways, and the Extra DLC pack (previously only available in the Deluxe Edition) of character skins, weapons, and items. Of course, The Mercenaries mode serves as free DLC. The price is unknown at the time of publishing, but if you haven&#x27;t picked up the game on console, PC, iOS, or PS VR2, this looks to be a good way to get everything in one neat package. 
Resident Evil 4 Gold Edition is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.</span>

                              <span>In 2013, an unassuming Xbox Live Arcade game was released called Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it&#x27;s all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers&#x27; release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.
Now, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.
And for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.
