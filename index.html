That&#x27;s how much it will cost you to buy the package from the Epic Games Store. It includes the base game and the three pieces of DLC released thus far. More interestingly, it also includes a new expansion that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet.

                              <span>When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque&#x27;s challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I&#x27;m sorry to say that&#x27;s about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Pre-orderers can play the campaign a week early, technically, but that’s still a good couple of weeks away as well. By the way, could you help me out? I can’t remember the actor who’s playing the shouty general’s name and it’s really bothering me. He’s in the trailer below, watch it and let me know in the comments please.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be clear about one thing: whatever else I say today doesn&#x27;t deny that building games are in a great state right now. Within just the last few years, we&#x27;ve not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers &amp; Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they&#x27;ve had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

Yep, Need For Speed Unbound is looking pretty cel-shaded, with little cartoon streams of dust flying up from the wheels of your speeding vehicle. Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn&#x27;t even out yet and there&#x27;s already a rumour circulating that, to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, the game&#x27;s going to receive a paid &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; map pack featuring a bunch of the classic maps from across the series. We&#x27;re talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it&#x27;s only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

                              <span>Sci-fi colony simulator RimWorld is capable of generating some scenarios that could make The Sims 4 blush, and the newly announced Biotech expansion isn’t likely to change that. Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we&#x27;ve enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew&#x27;s is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That&#x27;s one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

                              <span>Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. COD help us all.

The High School Years update from July is also facilitating accidental sibling incest, still, after one method of sibling highschool be-sandwiching was fixed in August. It appears to be an entrenched problem. Those kids must really like House Of The Dragon.

Devolver Digital&#x27;s comically unnerving roguelike, Cult of the Lamb, has ironically become something of a cult hit itself, winning over fans with its creepy-cute visuals, anarchic attitude, and engaging gameplay — In fact, Massive Monster&#x27;s indie hit has already bagged its first Game of the Year award, courtesy of the Australian Game Developer Awards.
The event, which took place on the evening on October 4, recognized the best of interactive entertainment from 2022 to date, focusing mostly on the output of independent studios working within the region. Cult of the Lamb scuttled off with four well-deserved gongs, including Excellence in Art, Excellence in Music, Excellence in Gameplay, and the aforementioned Game of the Year award.

                              <span>The mode won&#x27;t have any buy-in anymore
Unknown Worlds&#x27; Moonbreaker recently dropped into Early Access, allowing players to buy in and test it out. And in response to that feedback, the studio is already removing one element: the Cargo Run&#x27;s Contracts.
Cargo Run is a game mode in Moonbreaker where players can carry over, battle-to-battle, in order to build up a streak and win rewards. Playing through rounds, you still play typical Moonbreaker. Fight another team with your squad, defeat the Captain, and move on. If you fail, you drop the Cargo Run.
Playing these Cargo Runs initially cost a Contract. It&#x27;s not too dissimilar from how Hearthstone handles its Arena draft mode. Along the way, you can pick up cargo during matches for power boosts to your chosen squad, and get Blanks, a type of currency in Moonbreaker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jA_ApUlmD6A
Dropping some cargo
Players, however, didn&#x27;t seem to like this set-up. Moonbreaker costs money to buy into already, and having an additional fee on top to play the Cargo Run mode didn&#x27;t seem to sit right.
In a post titled the &quot;Cargo Run Update&quot;, the Moonbreaker team confirms it&#x27;s removing Contracts from the game entirely.
&quot;While our intent was always for players to be able to earn enough Blanks during Cargo Run to continually unlock additional Contracts to play, we understand the community’s collective frustration that this mode felt gated and the desire to have any possible limitation removed,&quot; the blog reads.
Any players who purchased Contracts using Pulsars or Blanks before this change will get the full amount of relevant currency refunded. Any Contracts still in your player inventory will be converted to Blanks. And as the game is being adjusted for unlimited Cargo Run play, Blanks will not be on the reward table for the mode any more. Season Track XP will still be earnable, though.

Kao the Kangaroo is one of many video game stars who will be getting into the spooky spirit this Halloween, with Tate Multimedia announcing a new paid DLC drop for the anarchic antipodean&#x27;s recent comeback title. The Oh! Well DLC bundle will launch on all platforms October 13.
The new DLC includes five all-new Eternal Well stages to conquer, each sporting creepy variants on its villains and a Burton-esque color scheme, adding to the supernatural vibe. As Kao punches his way through each stage, he will also unlock a selection of five freaky skins, which will be perfect for October 31, when yer bouncy boy goes trick or treating. You can check out the new content in the trailer below.

The Kao the Kangaroo sequel launched last summer, following a successful player campaign to bring the marvelous marsupial back to the world of mascot platformers. While the new title will be unashamedly over-familiar for fans of another 3D platform hero, Kao the Kangaroo is a fun, attractive, and charming adventure — definitely worth checking out for genre fans. In fact, from October 13, players can pick up the original game, all previous DLC, and the new Halloween bundle for a special $34.99 bundle price.

Two massive ports are the key focus of this week&#x27;s Nintendo eShop drop: including NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition (October 12) , and No Man&#x27;s Sky (October 7). LEGO Bricktales is due out on October 12.
NieR: Automata coming to Switch is kind of a big deal, as the series continues to slowly expand platforms over the course of five years. It started on PS4, then went to PC, then Xbox One, and now Switch.
As for what&#x27;s coming up next, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is set for later this month, followed by Bayonetta 3. It&#x27;ll be a big mid-to-late October for Nintendo!

Following on from several months of leaks and rumors, Electronic Arts has finally lifted the curtain on the next entry in its long-running racing game series Need for Speed — As whispered by industry insiders, the new entry is titled Need for Speed Unbound, and will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H2Y8XCe7F9E
As you can see from the stylish trailer above, soundtracked by the dulcet tones of A$AP Rocky, NFS Unbound will see a return to the competitive and combative street racing vibes of previous franchise entries such as the excellent Need for Speed Underground. NFS Unbound will follow the escapades of a die-hard, passionate gang of street racers, as they battle their way through the neon streets of the city, the ever-present wail of police sirens floating listlessly in the night skies.
As is to be expected, NFS Unbound will feature state-of-the-art visuals and game mechanics, and will also place a heavy emphasis on player customization, allowing the community to modify and decorate their ride so it will spin as many heads as it will wheels — in keeping with the new game flashy fashionista aesthetic. Developed by racing genre veterans Criterion Games, it is a fairly safe bet that NFS Unbound will deliver when it finally pulls out of the garage this winter.
Need for Speed Unbound launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.

An Overwatch 2 SMS requirement became a hot topic in the last week or so, after it was revealed so close to launch: but that&#x27;s no longer going to be a thing for a subset of players.
Taking to the official Blizzard forums to talk about the launch, the subject of SMS Protect came up. In short, Blizzard has &quot;made the decision to remove phone number requirements for a majority of existing Overwatch players,&quot; with a fix expected to roll out on October 7. This entails a lack of a requirement for &quot;any Overwatch player with a connected Battle.net account, which includes all players who have played since June 9, 2021.&quot; For anyone who fits that bill, it&#x27;s good news, as they were likely the mo…</span>

Promising something dedicated fans will enjoy, the new Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer is a big one, clocking in at 14 minutes. The video dump today mostly focuses on storylines centered around the three core overarching narratives of the game.
For one of the first times ever, we&#x27;re getting a clear look at actual gameplay, including battle menus that aren&#x27;t by way of a few seconds of fleeting footage. We get to see one of the starting loadouts for Quaxly (water gun, work up, wing attack, aqua jet), as well as the terrastallize ability, which is linked the R button.
Moving through the Scarlet and Violet trailer, we also get a walkthrough of mysterious Pokemon that shine (and are visible in the overworld), which can terrastalize after engaging them, and ch…</span>

The legendary &quot;Here Comes a New Challenger&quot; screen is a staple of the Street Fighter series, popping up whenever somebody dropped in a quarter and slapped the 2P start button, giving you that sinking feeling that the solo fun you had been enjoying was, in fact, coming to an end.

Indie outfit DreadXP, in association with AMC Networks and Cartel Entertainment, has announced that it has begun the development of a brand new video game based on the iconic horror anthology series Creepshow. Platforms or a release window were not announced.
The new game has been inspired by the TV series currently airing on horror network Shudder, which is itself styled after a trilogy of comically dark movies written and produced by author Stephen King and late director George A. Romero. While horror anthology films have been released in abundance over the past 50 years, the original Creepshow (1982) is still considered perhaps one of the genre&#x27;s finest examples — even if the sequels are the very epitome of the law of diminishing returns.

                              <span>Press F for a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sequel
Considering the series has been around for a few decades at this point, Call of Duty has had to reinvent itself over and over to keep bringing players fresh concepts. The games have covered concepts from the first World War all the way to futuristic space combat, and some were received better than others, to say the least. Now that the series has started cycling back through classic CoD eras like World War II and the modern day, I guess I should have realized that the franchise would be returning to some of their other, less beloved concepts too.
As of a report from known (and often right) Call of Duty leaker Ralph Valve, Sledgehammer&#x27;s upcoming 2025 CoD title will be a sequel to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was originally released back in 2014. Valve also reports that Sledgehammer&#x27;s next game was supposed to be a follow-up to the World War II-themed Vanguard, which didn&#x27;t end up selling enough copies to warrant a sequel in its wake.
Advanced Warfare is certainly well-known, although a lot of that has to do with the now infamous &quot;press F to pay respects&quot; sequence. The gameplay allowed for increased mobility in gameplay thanks to the introduction of Exoskeleton armor, and fans seemed to like it enough before the series went fully futuristic with the near universally-disliked Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare that came out in 2016.
Although I have three different CoD titles under my belt now, I&#x27;m still getting to know the series, especially when it comes to the games with modern or futuristic settings. I guess if Valve&#x27;s report is correct, then it&#x27;s worth me going back to play some of the old games just to get a sense. From what I hear, though, I will definitely be steering clear of Call of Duty: Ghosts.

                              <span>Tequila Works&#x27; horror game is not going down with the ship
The news of Google Stadia&#x27;s closure had an immediate effect on several developers. But it looks like Tequila Works and its horror game Gylt will be lasting beyond Stadia&#x27;s closure.
Gylt was first released in November 2019 as a Google Stadia exclusive. In a new blog on the studio&#x27;s website, the team confirms that Gylt will be heading to new platforms.
&quot;Spooky season is around the corner... And we bring terrific news!&quot; reads the quick update. &quot;We&#x27;ve been working on it for a long time and it&#x27;s finally time to make it official: Gylt is going multiplatform in 2023!&quot;
No details about which platforms that entails have been released yet. Tequila Works suggest staying tuned to its social media channels for updates and news.

A Gylt trip
This is great news for Tequila Works fans who never got around to this particular project. The makers of Rime and The Sexy Brutale make some really cool-looking games, but Gylt was one of the notable exclusives Google nabbed for Stadia.
At least in this case, Gylt will not be riding off into the night. Hopefully we get some news soon about what platforms it will be coming to next year.
Meanwhile, other developers are trying to figure out their own solutions to Stadia&#x27;s closure. Google announced the service is going down last week, confirming that it plans to refund users as well. The cloud streaming service for playing games launched in 2019, and has since seen competition rise from sources like Microsoft&#x27;s xCloud.
The announcement came as a shock to some developers, who were still planning to bring games to the platform. Companies like Ubisoft, Bungie, and IO Interactive have all confirmed they&#x27;re looking into methods of helping players who want to keep playing their games.

                              <span>Everyone relates with a sad trombone
A couple of times a year, a &quot;Phenomenon Game&quot; pops up out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town. Trombone Champ fits that description. It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn&#x27;t come from nowhere. The people who made Trombone Champ had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.
The game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto. They&#x27;ve been self-publishing games for about a decade, and most of their projects have been free. Trombone Champ is actually the first title they&#x27;ve ever sold on Steam, so you can imagine their surprise when it went on to sell 20,000+ copies in its launch window, prompting NBC, The New York Times, and the CBC to all come calling for interviews.

Much to my surprise, they were also willing to talk to me for my Talking to Women about Videogames podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify). It&#x27;s a small-time show by NBC standards, but since they had an OK time on Sup, Holmes (an interview live stream show for game devs I used to do), I guess they didn&#x27;t mind coming back for another talk eight years later. I&#x27;ve been rooting for these two ever since then, long before I knew they were the people who made Trombone Champ, and it&#x27;s been so great to see those roots grow into a tree made of trombones, thousands of dollars, and mainstream media attention.
We got into all that plus the couple&#x27;s love of Star Trek, D&amp;D, gnomes, my theories on the autobiographical nature of their gameography, and a lot more. Thanks again to Dan and Jackie for taking the time, and doing it on video to boot. It was (ahem) a &quot;hoot.&quot;

The AMD Cloud Platform is a currently parallel effort to the Accelerator Cloud with the former intended more for developers while the latter is more customer-oriented.

It would perhaps be the understatement of the year to say that Splatoon 3 has been a big hit. The game has broken records with the sheer quantity of sales that it has made in Japan and the same can be said across the world. The game has been such a big hit, in fact, that even Google has got in on the action.
Getting a Google interactive Easter egg on your search is like having the popular kid in school come to your party - it&#x27;s a sign that you are in the big leagues - and Splatoon is now most certainly part of that crew.

Another week, another chart-topping performance from Splatoon 3.
Yes, the multiplayer sequel has hit number one yet again in the Japanese charts, bringing in another 157,348 copies for Nintendo. It&#x27;s another drop from the previous week, but still leagues ahead of The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki II at number two, which managed a comparatively modest (yet still solid in its own right) 36,261 units.

On top of the many new features that were revealed in the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer, one that we didn&#x27;t expect was the ability to have a picnic with your monster team - but that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re getting!
As seen in the timestamped video above, the Paldea region will bring with it the chance to stop for regular picnic breaks when out on your travels. Aside from providing photo opportunities, setting up a picnic lets you clean your Pokémon and improve their stats with the power of sandwiches - because of course it does.

There&#x27;s lots to dive into with the new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, including TM crafting, the new Farigiraf evolution, and heaps more, but one thing that&#x27;s tucked away in the in-game mini-map is a bunch of new species that you may have missed.
As spotted by @PLDHnet over on Twitter, we get a peek at three new species of Pokémon (and a Rookidee, bless it), including what looks like a weird little mushroom / house, an all-white mouse thingy, and a green parakeet.

                              <span>Palindromic evolution.
A part of the new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet And Violet, it&#x27;s been revealed that Girafarig will now evolve into Farigiraf (Listen, Pokémon Company, those names are really hard to type out - don&#x27;t do this to us!).
Farigiraf is a Normal / Psychic Pokémon whose head and tail effectively fuse together to become one - very bizarre! Nevertheless, its head is now fully equipped for both offensive and defensive capabilities, which will come in handy for its &#x27;Cud Chew&#x27; and &#x27;Armor Tail&#x27; abilities.

Splatoon 3 has been consistently gaining traction since its launch in September, particularly for its excellent enhancements to the multiplayer along with an improved Salmon Run mode and solid single-player component. But it seems players in Japan are starting to get concerned about the use of QR codes in the game&#x27;s hub area (thanks, Automaton).
Players can currently add illustrations into the Splatoon 3 hub area as fairly high resolution pixel art. As such, some users are utilising this to add QR codes to their creations, leading people who scans these with their mobile devices to online websites.

No More Heroes III is releasing on a few more platforms this month, and as part of this Goichi Suda is once again doing the press rounds to promote the game.
Although Suda51 previously bid farewell to Travis Touchdown, it seems there&#x27;s still a chance of the world famous assassin making a comeback. It all depends on fan feedback, and if there&#x27;s enough &quot;outcry&quot; Suda might consider bringing it back.

Update: Blizzard has just shared an update on its website - revealing it will be loosening phone number requirements for a majority of existing Overwatch players. However, new accounts will still have to meet the SMS Protect requirements. Here are the full details in its official forum update:

&quot;We designed Overwatch 2 to be a live service, which enables us to be responsive to a variety of player feedback. We have made the decision to remove phone number requirements for a majority of existing Overwatch players. Any Overwatch player with a connected Battle.net account, which includes all players who have played since June 9, 2021, will not have to provide a phone number to play. We are working to make this change and expect it to go live on Friday, October 7. We will update players once it is in effect.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

                              <span>Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn&#x27;t just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game&#x27;s SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a &quot;unique&quot; phone number for authentication purposes.

                              <span>Zítra a pozítří probíhá Hackathon veřejné správy 4.0: &quot;Stát disponuje nepředstavitelným množstvím dat. Jsou mimo jiné ukrytá v tisících informačních systémů, za jejichž vznik a údržbu stát ročně zaplatí miliardy korun. Mnoho dat se ale do těchto systémů zadává špatně či neúplně, některá zcela chybí. Jiná jsou duplicitní, další si protiřečí. A o tom, jak jsou na tom tyto systémy s uživatelským komfortem, a do kolika z nich může veřejnost alespoň trošku nahlédnout, o tom snad ani není třeba mluvit. Hackathon už několik ročníků ukazuje, jaké přínosy a výhody může mít pro stát i občany to, když stát otevře a zpřístupní svá data. Jak se tato data dají využít k novým poznatkům, k tvorbě aplikací a systémů, ke zkvalitnění prostředí, ve kterém vy, daňoví poplatníci, žijete&quot;.</span>

                              <span>Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG&#x27;s Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG&#x27;s 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell&#x27;s even better S2721DGFA - and it&#x27;s this monitor that&#x27;s on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that&#x27;s already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it&#x27;s not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that&#x27;s equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I&#x27;ll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow for more deals.

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

It also reveals some co-op hunting action for the first time. Take a look at the footage below, and try not to giggle when the sproingy hammer whacks the giant piggy.

                              <span>Soccer sim FIFA 23 has been given its first patch since the Day One update, but don’t expect to encounter any earth-shattering changes when you next take to the pitch. Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

                              <span>Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn&#x27;t a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that&#x27;s your jam.
Whether you&#x27;re new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don&#x27;t know whether it goes beyond &quot;perfectly enjoyable&quot; into &quot;thrilling&quot;, though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it&#x27;s a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

                              <span>Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man&#x27;s Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it&#x27;s a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn&#x27;t have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn&#x27;t have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn&#x27;t be has never left me, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn&#x27;t able to get back up to it again.

This time, the immersive sim shenanigans are going open-world. The Steam page also provides some inkling of what else is coming when the game launches in 2023. Did I mention it’s coming out in 2023?

The delay was announced along with the reveal of a closed technical test for Freelancer starting early next month. And here I was, thinking that Ian Hitman never missed a target.

                              <span>Last month, Rachel and I made the long pilgrammage to Seattle in order to attend PAX West 2022. While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we&#x27;d discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we&#x27;re now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there&#x27;s something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights. Scroll down to see what we got up to, and remember, if you like what you see please do consider funding content like this via our supporters programme. It truly means an awful lot.

                              <span>Get ready to battle some bosses
Dead Cells is widely regarded as one of the best roguelike games out there, and one of the best indie games of the past decade. It&#x27;s one of those games you can play over and over again -- literally -- but for fans who are itching for something new, well, the Dead Cells dev team has you covered. The studio behind the game, Motion Twin, along with their subsidiary studio Evil Empire, announced an all-new Boss Rush mode as an add-on for the PC version of Dead Cells.
The idea is that players will have four unique stages to play through, and each stage has the player going up against bosses from the game back-to-back. The breakdown of stages goes like this: stage one has three bosses, stage two has five bosses, stage three has three enhanced bosses, and stage four has five enhanced bosses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;gCaZwowMm78
The enhanced bosses are new for the Boss Rush mode, and as you might expect, they have ways to make their already-intense battles even harder, like healing powers or allies that come and join them in the fight. If you&#x27;ve played through some of the harder heats in Hades, think of the enhanced boss stages like runs where you&#x27;re only fighting Extreme Measures bosses.
Each stage also features Dead Cells bosses randomly selected from Tiers 1, 2, or 3, to which they are assigned based on how difficult they are -- so at least you won&#x27;t be fighting The Queen five times in a row. The Boss Rush mode is accessible in-game through a door in the basement of the Prisoners&#x27; Quarters. Players will also win some serious loot as they defeat the different stages, with the type of prizes scaling depending on how many bosses they fight, which bosses they fight, and so on.
The Boss Rush mode is available now in Dead Cells for PC players, and will be coming to consoles later this month.

Valve is hosting the October Steam Next Fest right now, full of demos, livestreams, and more about games coming to the Steam platform.
There are actually hundreds of free, playable game demos on the platform right now from October 3 through 10. It&#x27;s a great time for developers to show off what they&#x27;ve been working on, put more eyes on their Steam store pages, and accrue some coveted Wishlist additions.
With so many demos available, though, it can be a bit daunting to find exactly what you might like. Or to stumble upon something you didn&#x27;t expect. That&#x27;s where round-ups like these come in.
While by no means comprehensive, I&#x27;ve been spending the last few days digging through the lineup, playing demos, and adding them to my to-play list. Some of these gam…</span>

                              <span>With Splatoon and Animal Crossing in the mix
As announced on Twitter, there will be several Nintendo concerts going on this month: specifically kicking off on October 10 at 11:00 CEST (5AM ET).
While details are slim, we do know that the digital concerts will feature the DJ K.K. [Slider] Animal Crossing: New Horizons Paradise Mix and Splatoon 3 Deep Cut performances. Based on the YouTube description, the concert is scheduled to go on for roughly one hour. To be clear, Nintendo has clarified that &quot;both performances will be in Japanese without localized subtitles.&quot; You may recall that Nintendo has done various forms of K.K. Slider and Splatoon idol performances in the past, so this is mainly continuing that trend.
It&#x27;s good to see Animal Crossing back in the fold in some form, as the great rush of billions of amiibo figures/cards seems to be at an end, alongside of major New Horizons updates. Splatoon 3 of course just came out, and alongside of regular free updates and Splatfests, will have a nice little footprint going into the holiday season.
It&#x27;s also a nice way to see the newest Splatoon trio in action, given how popular the past characters have been!

Killer Queen Black launched back in 2019, and it&#x27;s been a staple of my household ever since. The extremely unconventional team-versus-team game involved 5v5 battles to the death, with multiple ways to win each match. It encouraged a heavy dollop of team communication and tactical nuance in a way most games couldn&#x27;t touch. But the era of playing it at home online is coming to an end on November 30, 2022.
Thankfully, Liquid Bit CEO Matt Tesch has fully explained the situation in a new blog, which they say is out of their hands. The crux of the problem is Amazon GameSparks, which essentially hosted the backend of Killer Queen Black. Amazon shut it down on September 30, but the team was able to get an &quot;extension,&quot; through November 30, partially to finish out …</span>

CD Projekt RED co-founder and joint CEO Marcin Iwiński has announced that they are stepping down from their role at the Polish studio, following a near-30-year tenure with the Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer. Iwiński made the announcement via an official statement posted Tuesday.
&quot;I am beginning a brand new personal chapter at CD Projekt, as I will submit my candidacy for the role of Chairman to the Supervisory Board, leaving behind my joint CEO role,&quot; writes Iwiński. &quot;I’ve been at CD Projekt for almost 30 years and I have seen it go from a handful of passion-driven rebels to an internationally recognized developer of story-driven role-playing games loved by million globally.&quot;

                              <span>A new voice for the Umbra Witch
The next entry in the Bayonetta series arrives this month. But the voice actor of the series&#x27; protagonist won&#x27;t be returning for Bayonetta 3.
In an interview with Game Informer for its cover story on Bayonetta 3, Platinum Games confirms that Hellena Taylor, the voice actress of Bayonetta in the first two games, is not returning for the third.
Fans had speculated this may be the case, but now Platinum has made it clear. Rather than Taylor, Bayonetta will be voiced by popular voice actor Jennifer Hale.
&quot;Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,&quot; said game director Yusuke Miyata to Game Informer. &quot;We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom we felt was a good match for the character. I understand the concerns some fans have about the voice change at this point in the series, but Jennifer&#x27;s performance was way beyond what we could have imagined. I&#x27;m confident that her portrayal of Bayonetta will exceed our fans&#x27; expectations.&quot;
Bayonetta&#x27;s voice actor for the Japanese VO will still be Atsuko Tanaka.

A new voice in the fray
Jennifer Hale is well-known for her work on several different game franchises, ranging from Rivet in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Ashe in Overwatch to perhaps her most well-known role as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy. There&#x27;s little question that Platinum got someone talented to fill the shoes (gun-heels?) of Bayonetta.
Whether Hale fits as well as Taylor did for Bayonetta or not is the question. GI&#x27;s coverage seems positive on the change, commending Hale&#x27;s portrayal as being &quot;sometimes indistinguishable&quot; from Taylor&#x27;s work in the first two games. But if you want to find out yourself, you&#x27;ll have to wait until later this month.
Bayonetta 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on October 28.

Every game is a potential target for troublemakers, even Iron Galaxy&#x27;s excellent 2013 fighter Killer Instinct, which is currently mired in its own hack-based catastrophe, despite the relative quietness of the fast-paced scrapper in the larger picture of the fighting game community.
Killer Instinct&#x27;s ranked mode has, for some time now, been the target of one individual, who has been rendering the leaderboards an absolute mess with a flurry of fake accounts, which they have used to essentially &quot;jam&quot; the online rankings for the dedicated KI community.

                              <span>Upgraded from &quot;Winter 2022&quot;
As you may recall, Capcom has a grand plan for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak post-launch support, which involves a roadmap with both pointed details and teasers. We got a major free title update in August, then another one in late September. Now, Capcom has confirmed that free title update 3, the next huge Monster Hunter Rise update, is coming in late November.
While it was previously slated for &quot;winter 2022,&quot; it&#x27;s now a sure thing for next month, and currently the plans include variant monsters (previously billed as &quot;special species monsters&quot;), as well as powered-up monsters. Capcom teases that more will be revealed in the coming weeks, and there&#x27;s still &quot;free title updates&quot; slated for 2023. We&#x27;re still unsure on the scope of what 2023 will bring, but so far the free title updates have injected more life into the game: which technically began with the launch of Rise in March of 2021.
Typically, on Switch, these patches will run around 0.6GB-1GB in size, and will add all sorts of quality of life features (including new guild card pages or awards), and bug fixes. While I&#x27;m not playing as much Rise currently with other stuff on my plate, it&#x27;s nice to know that I won&#x27;t miss anything diving back in, and these free updates will be waiting.

Sony Interactive Entertainment and Disney have announced that the shiny PS5 platform now has its own native Disney+ app available for download. This will allow users on the platform to access the Disney streaming service on their console in magnificent 4K HDR resolutions.
&quot;A key part of our global expansion strategy is to meet consumers wherever they are, which is why we&#x27;re excited to enhance both Disney Plus and Star Plus for PlayStation 5 users,&quot; notes EVP of product and design for Disney, Jerrell Jimerson in comments to The Verge. &quot;The ability to support 4K HDR video streaming on the platform will also improve the viewing experience for fans.&quot;
With the arrival of the Disney+ app, subscribers will now have access to an enormous archive of film, TV, and animated content from The House of Mouse. This includes films and shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe — such as recent Chud-aggravator She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, as well as thousands of hours of classic FOX programming such as the good episodes of The Simpsons and nothing else. Of course, you can also check out Disney&#x27;s legendary catalog of classic animated movies, all starring wicked queens that I fancy.
Now that the PlayStation 5 platform offers access to Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, HBO Max, as well as an abundance of rad video games via the PlayStation Plus service, you basically don&#x27;t have to leave the couch ever again. Better get started this weekend, however, I&#x27;m pretty sure none of us have the time necessary to watch every single episode of every single Star Wars show before we shuffle on.
And I still gotta find space and time for the celluloid excellence that is Hocus Pocus 2.

                              <span>The power of Goku in 60 FPS
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is getting an upgrade for newer console hardware. Both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console versions of Kakarot are on the way with some shiny new graphics options.
These versions will launch on January 13, 2023, right near the start of the new year. For those who already have Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, Bandai Namco Entertainment will have a free upgrade path. Physical versions of the newer generation title will also be in the works.
As for the features, faster loading times and fluid gameplay up to 60 FPS are what Bandai Namco&#x27;s got in store. There are also new visual details. The in-game card game Card Warriors will also be available as an offline version, for solo play.

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot will be available as just the standalone Standard Edition, or with the Deluxe or Legendary Edition, which include some of the post-launch DLC for Kakarot. Deluxe buyers get the first Season Pass, while Legendary buyers get the first and second Season Pass.
Rock the dragon
This action-RPG-ish take on Goku&#x27;s journey will be just about two years old when the newer generation versions hit, and it&#x27;s received a fair bit of support. As mentioned before, there are two Season Passes worth of content, plus more DLC that apparently features Goku&#x27;s dad Bardock on the way.
But if 2D fighting games are more your Dragon Ball flavor, there&#x27;s still some good news on the way. It was confirmed at Evo 2022 that Dragon Ball FighterZ will be getting PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, with rollback netcode on the way too. It seems like a pretty good time if you&#x27;re a Dragon Ball fan with a new console, eager to see how the new hardware can render all those Gokus.

                              <span>Live service titles are an exception
PlayStation Studios&#x27; head Hermen Hulst has noted that he expects future PlayStation titles to enjoy at least a year&#x27;s exclusivity on home console platforms before making the jump to PC — The former Guerrilla Games managing director made the comments in an interview with journalist Julien Chieze.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RXSyAfNuvg8&amp;t&#x3D;432s
&quot;I think, going forward, we’ll see at least a year between releases on PlayStation and on the PC platform, possibly with the exception of live service games,&quot; said Hulst when asked about the recent range of PC ports. &quot;Live service games are a little bit different in nature because you want to have a strong community, strong engagement right away, right when you go live. So we might, in the case of our live service offerings, go day and date with PC and the PlayStation platform.&quot;
The Steam community has recently enjoyed a wide variety of previously considered PlayStation exclusives, including stellar releases such as God of War; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and its follow-up Miles Morales; Horizon Zero Dawn; as well as games from Naughty Dog&#x27;s best-selling Uncharted franchise. Rumors also abound that Housemarque&#x27;s PS5 sci-fi smash, Returnal, is also en route to the Steam platform.
Given Hulst&#x27;s comments, it seems that PlayStation continues in its commitment to bringing its best-sellers to the PC audience but, understandably, wishes to give its loyal PS4/PS5 community priority. So while Steam fans will have to sit on their hands a little, they can be sure their patience will pay off.
PlayStation games will wait ‘at least a year’ before their PC release, except for live service titles [VGC]

Microsoft has just unveiled their Xbox Game Pass October offerings, and so far it&#x27;s looking good, especially when it comes to variety. I mean, it&#x27;s pretty much on point every month in that regard, but genre-wise, there&#x27;s a good spread.
One highlight includes Telltale&#x27;s Walking Dead, which is launching both Season 1 and Season 2 on October 6. This is some of Telltale&#x27;s earliest work, before they took on way too many projects and imploded. Chivalry 2 isn&#x27;t a bad get either, and you can throw in the quirky Costume Quest for good measure.
Bigger Xbox Game Pass releases include Plague Tale: Requiem and Scorn later this month, which are day-and-date brand new launches with Game Pass. Both of those include cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S platforms. We&#x27;re not losing a lot this month either! It should be a fun little time to sail into the winter season with a ton of games to play.
You can find the full schedule with exact dates below for both the additions and departures.

Chivalry 2, October 4 (Cloud, Console, and PC)

Back when I wrote my award-winning (deleted from Reddit) article on the Do&#x27;s and Do Not Do&#x27;s for Street Fighter 6, I placed heavy emphasis on the desperate need to overhaul the rules of Ranked Mode — a mode that myriad players told me was too frustrating, stressful, and simply not fun to play. Well, with the Street Fighter 6 beta creeping round the corner, we&#x27;re starting to see some much-needed changes.
From notes written in the Ranked Mode menu screen, we can ascertain that Street Fighter 6 will once again see players win and lose points in online battles, as they progress through eight recognizable tiers: Rookie, Iron (new), Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master. However, several extra rulings have been put in place, …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s running through November 9
A new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it&#x27;s currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.
As a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it&#x27;ll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector&#x27;s edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It&#x27;ll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
Here is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:
Rabbid Mario Figurine
Rabbid Peach Figurine
Set of 3 lithographs
Spark Plush
Artbook
Spark Phone Ring Holder
Stickers Sheet

While the Street Fighter 6 beta is yet to get officially underway, eager players are already exploring the settings of the PC edition, pulling out tidbits and new news regarding all of the excitement that takes place outside of the ring and under the hood — But perhaps best of all, it appears that Capcom&#x27;s latest will offer the best accessibility options in the history of the storied series.
For visually impaired players, Street Fighter 6 seemingly offers a custom sound deck, that not only offers up spoken signals for the game&#x27;s menu system and select screens but also features fully customizable sound options for the fight itself. Players can adjust the balance and sound applied to all manner of in-game commands — from accurately ascertaining distance, to whether a st…</span>

Typically, the launch of any online Blizzard title is met with incredibly long queues, strained servers, and clogged login sessions, as sure as day follows night, this is to be expected — Unfortunately, yesterday&#x27;s launch of shooter sequel Overwatch 2 not only had hundreds of thousands of players to contend with, but the servers were hit with a least two DDoS attacks from a party of hackers.
The free-to-play title experienced connection carnage immediately upon launch, with an initial attack coinciding with thousands upon thousands of players attempting to get back to their world of heroes.

                              <span>By far the cutest thing I&#x27;ve seen all week
I&#x27;ve always loved snakes. When I was in middle school, we had one of those Snakes Alive! organizations come and do an educational demonstration. I guess I didn&#x27;t look as scared or grossed out as the other kids, because the host called me up and handed me a black snake, who then found his way into the pocket of my hoodie. It was adorable.
That said, I don&#x27;t think I would ever own a reptile, but I love looking at cute snake videos as much as the next person. That&#x27;s why it was such a treat to log into Twitter today and see that someone had taught their pet snake how to play Pokémon Go. I didn&#x27;t know you could even train a snake to do such a thing, but I&#x27;m so, so glad that this person did.
https://twitter.com/SnakeHour/status/1577043448750047232
The tweet was from an account called @SnakeHour (which posts snake content on the hour every hour for all your snake content needs), but the original video is a TikTok from user @maudespaperwinggallery. It features the snake&#x27;s owner holding them up in front of a phone that has Pokémon Go open, and the snake then uses their little nose to launch Poké Balls at what appears to be a Combee. What really tops off the whole thing for me is the classic Pokémon anime theme song playing over the video.
Now I want to know — does the snake have their own account? Does their owner take them outside on Pokémon-catching adventures? Which Team did they join? Most importantly: did they ever end up catching the Combee? It&#x27;s likely we won&#x27;t get any more information about this scaly little guy or gal, as is the way of the internet, but they will forever live on in my heart.
Good luck, you sweet little Pokémon master.

Now considered one of the best indie titles of 2020, Spiritfarer is one of the coziest and most heartfelt games out there. If you haven&#x27;t played it yet, it&#x27;s a definite must if you ask me, and now you can play it right on your phone — if you have Netflix, that is. That&#x27;s right, Spiritfarer is the next banger of a game that has been added to the streaming company&#x27;s games library, along with Oxenfree and Moonlighter, to name a few.
Spiritfarer has players take on the role of Stella, a young girl who is to become the new Spiritfarer, or a figure who helps the souls of those who have passed and escorts them safely to the afterlife. It sounds bleak, but it&#x27;s actually one of the most whimsical, touching, and comforting takes on death I&#x27;ve seen. The gameplay includes cooking, gardening, gathering materials, upgrading your boat, and giving hugs to those who might need them.

Like I said, it&#x27;s one of the best simulators out there, and it&#x27;s a smart move for Netflix to grab such a beloved game to help bring players to their platform. The company is going harder on its gaming venture than ever before, having recently announced that it has its own internal studios working to develop original IPs. Netflix also let us know about a new partnership with mobile games publisher Tilting Point, who has helped bring cooking game Spongebob: Get Cooking and an upcoming Narcos-themed game to the platform.
It&#x27;s a hard push, and after the closure of Google&#x27;s Stadia in the past few weeks, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Netflix fares in an already hyper-competitive market. The difference could be made in their dedication to creating their own titles in addition to games we already know and love, after all.

                              <span>DISH Network has won yet another significant damages award following a lawsuit filed against a pirate IPTV supplier. The U.S. broadcaster filed a complaint against My Indian TV in August 2021, but the service stayed online until this April. DISH will now take control of the service&#x27;s domains but whether it will see any of the $26.5m awarded by a New York court remains to be seen.

While there is no mention of damages, the ISP has agreed to ask its wholesale providers to block access to the notorious pirate site YTS. The providers are not named but Earthlink sells or resold AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable infrastructure.

We are rapidly closing in on the Switch release of Tactics Ogre: Reborn on November 11th and Square Enix has today provided us with a whole lot more information on what upgrades they have made to the series&#x27; latest arrival.
The full details are available to read online (thanks, Gematsu), outlining the game&#x27;s newest additions, user interface improvements and specific pieces of information on the game&#x27;s different characters and classes. Most importantly (by our money) Square Enix&#x27;s update shows how the game will work to improve your team customisation and battle precision through a number of new features.

Developer GOATi Entertainment has revealed that its futuristic racing title 22 Racing Series will be heading to the Switch in 2023 after a period of early access on Steam starting on November 22nd, 2022.
It&#x27;s another racer that reminds us of Nintendo&#x27;s own F-Zero franchise, which at the time of writing has now been dormant for nearly two decades. Still, that&#x27;s not to take away from 22 Racing Series, which, despite the rather lacklustre title, looks pretty darn good!

Yes, Chris Scullion — features editor over at VGC, formerly of Official Nintendo Magazine UK, and Nintendo Life contributor extraordinaire (most recently giving EA&#x27;s FIFA series a fitting send-off for us) — is back again with another entry in his excellent gaming encyclopedia series.
Having covered the NES, the SNES, and the Mega Drive / Genesis, as well as stopping off to cover the entire platforming genre, Scullion has now tackled the Nintendo 64 library as part of his epic and ongoing quest to make that Billy bookcase of yours earn its keep.

Farming games often don&#x27;t replicate real-world farming too closely — they prefer to strike a balance between fun and accurate, in which plants need watering every day, but pesticides, fertiliser, and maintenance aren&#x27;t really on your to do list.
But upcoming game SunnySide is aiming to take a more realistic approach to the world of agriculture — and they&#x27;ve even teamed up with Epic Gardening, a YouTube account with 2 million subscribers, to get it right. We spoke to the man behind Epic Gardening, Kevin Espiritu, about gardens, games, and growing crops...

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It&#x27;s unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn&#x27;t want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn&#x27;t seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can&#x27;t access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.</span>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we&#x27;re just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today&#x27;s news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ&#x27;s most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what&#x27;s to come in the game&#x27;s second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it&#x27;s a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

                              <span>Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force and EA revealed Wild Hearts last week, giving players a glimpse of what&#x27;s to come in this new beast-hunting game. 
Similar to Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.
“Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,” says game director Yusuke Miyata. “We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom…</span>

Newcomer developer Stubby Games and publisher Playstack revealed The Entropy Centre during the Future Games Showcase in June, and it immediately caught my attention. On the one hand, it seemed to wear its Portal-inspiration on its sleeve, an immediate draw for me. On the other hand, its concept as a puzzle game sounded new and unique: use a weapon that turns back time on individual objects aboard a space station to stop the Earth from exploding.
I continued to cover the game and its various trailer drops, excited to finally go hands-on with it, wondering if it’d live up…</span>

That includes a new trilogy of The Witcher RPGs, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and a brand new IP being developed by CD Projekt Red, plus two further games in The Witcher universe being created by third-party studios.

                              <span>Put a screenshot of Overwatch 2 next to a screenshot of Overwatch 1, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to spot any difference. Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I&#x27;ve experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King&#x27;s Row and Route 66, it&#x27;s like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I&#x27;ve simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I&#x27;m not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you&#x27;re in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you&#x27;re wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you&#x27;re wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

                              <span>The year 1985 contained so many cultural touchstones: Queen’s legendary Live Aid performance, Coca-Cola’s infamous New Coke release, the first-ever WrestleMania, and much more. Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…</span>

                              <span>Nearly four years after its reveal, Bayonetta 3 is finally on the horizon and graces Game Informer’s cover this month. Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has pulled back the curtains on its game development pipeline, revealing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games, and even a new IP. 
This news comes by way of the studio&#x27;s investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion &quot;will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe.&quot; 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says &quot;it is the beginning of a new saga&quot; and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

                              <span>EA and Motive Studios have released the first official gameplay trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space. 
The studio has been slowly releasing new information and video clips of this remake in its behind-the-scenes showcases focused on things like the game&#x27;s sound, visuals, or something else. But today&#x27;s trailer marks the first time we&#x27;ve seen this much official gameplay at once and it looks great. Terrifying, of course, but great. 
Check out the official Dead Space remake gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some high-resolution screenshots from today&#x27;s trailer: 

As you can see, this remake is looking awesome and we can&#x27;t wait to go hands-on with it. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer because it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 27, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don&#x27;t get too excited just yet – this first look isn&#x27;t a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don&#x27;t expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

Here&#x27;s a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film&#x27;s first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There&#x27;s Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario&#x27;s past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach&#x27;s castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There&#x27;s probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world&quot;.

                              <span>Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation&#x27;s investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, &quot;further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services&quot; is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst&#x27;s answer when asked about Sony&#x27;s investment in the studio. 
&quot;You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it&#x27;s also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,&quot; he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that&#x27;s not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio&#x27;s other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here&#x27;s hoping, though, because From Software&#x27;s properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s Witcher series, and Bloober Team&#x27;s own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
&quot;Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together,&quot; Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. &quot;The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.&quot; 
As noted in Babieno&#x27;s writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony&#x27;s God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…</span>

Once you get past its bizarre name, Dorfromantik offers simple, relaxing sessions of tile-matching puzzle goodness. Connecting hexagons to build pretty landscapes offers the thoughtful strategy of a city-builder to provide a stimulating yet overwhelmingly Zen atmosphere. 
Fans of the board game Carcassonne should quickly grasp Dorfromantik&#x27;s concept of drawing random tiles and finding high-scoring – and aesthetically pleasing – ways to place them on the field based on their scenery. Tiles only fit next to those with corresponding edges; r…</span>

                              <span>Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

This premiere is being dubbed as the &quot;first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we&#x27;re curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>A remake or remaster of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn is reportedly in the works alongside a new Horizon multiplayer game. 
This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn&#x27;t say whether this was a &quot;built from the ground up&quot; remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project&#x27;s big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West&#x27;s accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…</span>

That&#x27;s an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That&#x27;s about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

You can view the whole of October&#x27;s Steam Next Fest right here if you&#x27;d rather just dive in headfirst, but below you&#x27;ll find some hand-picked highlights we&#x27;ve been enjoying ahead of time - including a new Return Of The Obra Dinn-alike, a first-person skeleton shooter, an underwater citybuilders and a platformer where your gun is also an umbrella.

                              <span>A couple of weeks back you may remember that I played the early access build of Gloomwood, a very good Thief-like that currently snaps shut just as you reach the best bit. The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like &quot;Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.&quot;
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It&#x27;s just, I am an idiot.

So far, Bungie, IO Interactive and Ubisoft have issued statements to reassure Stadia users that they’re investigating ways to salvage their saves. It’s a welcome development following Google’s sudden shutdown revelation.

Well, Crystal Dynamics are running a survey seeking opinions about where a hypothetical next instalment in the series might go. They’re also checking whether anyone would be up for remasters or remakes of earlier games, such as Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver. If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

                              <span>When action RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn was revealed in March, its cinematic trailer struggled to conjure up anything more than a slight tinge of excitement. Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the &quot;Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, and chat to A44&#x27;s CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I&#x27;d expected, honestly, and I&#x27;ve come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

The Connecticut District Court dismissed Yout&#x27;s request to declare the service as non-infringing. In a detailed ruling, Judge Stefan Underhill concludes that the service failed to show that it doesn&#x27;t circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. Yout is disappointed and will appeal the verdict.

                              <span>Zdaleka ne každý může utratit stovky dolarů za softwarové upgrady. To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft na vedlejší kolej snížením ceny za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, čímž činí proces aktualizace mnohem dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, a tím ušetříte ještě více. A tady je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>

While the company itself has a piracy history, today it&#x27;s one of the most protective copyright holders in the industry. With a sweeping court injunction, it hoped to take Daftsex.com and several related services offline. However, the court slammed the brakes on the request, at least for now.

                              <span>Arcom, France&#x27;s Audiovisual and Digital Communication Regulatory Authority, has been sending positive signals about its fight against piracy since January 1, 2022. Among many claims, the latest report from president Roch-Olivier Maistre is a real attention grabber. According to him, In just six months, live sports piracy in France has been cut by 50%.

                              <span>Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life&#x27;s biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren&#x27;t your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they&#x27;re all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station&#x27;s head clerk, you&#x27;ll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It&#x27;s certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

There aren’t many details to go on just yet, but the game is in the early stages of development and will hold closed playtests on PC in Western Europe. If you’re of an inquiring mind, and like hanging out with mates in shooter lobbies, then all you can do for the moment is register your interest.

                              <span>Developers working on games for Stadia have expressed surprise and frustration that Google still haven&#x27;t made contact with them, almost 24 hours after the search giant announced they were shutting down their cloud gaming service yesterday afternoon. Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It&#x27;s not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google&#x27;s own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it&#x27;s more glorious than I dared to hope.

                              <span>Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn&#x27;t arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I&#x27;ve been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it&#x27;s put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

                              <span>December’s a month known for its white-haired, bearded men in weird outfits and hats, so it seems a fitting time of year for Slitherine Games to launch their remake of 4X strategy classic Master Of Magic. Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

                              <span>Out Of Hands is a fairly &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can&#x27;t say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill &quot;a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I&#x27;m pretty cut up about that&quot; story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn&#x27;t find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin&#x27; plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio&#x27;s Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re able to fuse together any monsters you &#x27;catch&#x27;, but moreso because it&#x27;s a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It&#x27;s looking mighty promising.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year&#x27;s Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It&#x27;s the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other &#x27;deadly games&#x27; you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she&#x27;s teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you&#x27;ll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each &#x27;episode&#x27;. It&#x27;s a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. &quot;He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,&quot; creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. &quot;He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.&quot;

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or even &quot;possibly, why?&quot;, then you might find Retro Gadgets handy when it launches on PC towards the end of the year. It’s a gadget creation station that lets you “invent, build, solder, code and customise” your own electronics.

                              <span>Motive Studios have detailed some of the ways that their upcoming remake of classic sci-fi survival horror Dead Space will differ, just as new screenshots of the game have cropped up on an early Xbox Store listing. A blog post from the developers shares how they’re reworking the game’s setting of the USG Ishimura, along with bringing protagonist Isaac Clarke into line with Dead Spaces 2 and 3. They’re also finding time to flesh out the story with extra side quests.

I&#x27;d literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn&#x27;t hold back his tears, which said it all, really.

There’s been no other official confirmation yet of the game’s release date for PC, or what storefronts it’ll be available from.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…</span>

                              <span>Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won&#x27;t be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds &quot;for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,&quot; according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won&#x27;t be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you &quot;will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.&quot; 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says &quot;most hardware purchases...made directly from Google&quot; will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia&#x27;s January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn&#x27;t the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming&#x27;s continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

As for why, the team doesn&#x27;t say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, &quot;You&#x27;ve waited long enough,&quot; so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players&#x27; hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below:

This PCIe 4.0 SSD offers sequential reads up to 7000MB/s and sequential writes up to 6000MB/s, making it one of the very fastest drives available, and today it&#x27;s also one of the cheapest. That&#x27;s because CCL have discounted the drive to £94.27, some £75 below its UK RRP and a terrific deal for a drive with these high-end specs.

The Amazon Prime Early Access Sale is taking place this October 11th-12th, a full six weeks before Black Friday 2022, and from a PC gaming standpoint will offer the same kinds of component and peripheral deals as that annual pre-Christmas shoppingfest. Just earlier.
That said, the Prime Early Access Sale isn’t purely a prelude to the anything-goes chaos of Black Friday. It’s more like a Prime Day 2, in that it’s an Amazon-only event, with all the best deals set to be require Amazon Prime membership to access. That’s right, it’s one of those.

                              <span>What appears to be an announcer pack voiced by Mark Hamill and leaked from Warner Bros licensed brawler MultiVersus indicates that The Joker might be arriving in a future update. Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it&#x27;s a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we&#x27;re now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director&#x27;s cut special editions. We&#x27;ve included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month&#x27;s Time Capsule, but there&#x27;s another notable exception we&#x27;ve decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016&#x27;s Special Edition?

                              <span>There&#x27;s a definition of &quot;pure&quot; that&#x27;s proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I&#x27;m genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many &#x27;retro&#x27; inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

                              <span>It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

Overwatch VP Jon Spector discussed brand crossovers during an interview with Game Informer, saying that Blizzard is “interested in exploring” partnerships like those you might see in Fortnite. Although, he did qualify that it would have to be in keeping with the Overwatch franchise.

It&#x27;s Yakuza with a murder-mystery twist that&#x27;s well worth your while even if you&#x27;re not actually that big on Kiryu or Ichiban&#x27;s antics. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

                              <span>It&#x27;s tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob&#x27;s Barrows&#x27; arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn&#x27;t care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It&#x27;s a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob&#x27;s Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn&#x27;t a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina&#x27;s eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

                              <span>Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it&#x27;s slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game&#x27;s development. 
Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer&#x27;s cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been delayed again.

                              <span>Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo have revealed Wild Hearts, a new Monster Hunter-like game coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year. 
More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game&#x27;s reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You&#x27;ll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s a fan of Capcom&#x27;s long-running Monster Hunter series.

&quot;I&#x27;m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!&quot;
Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his &quot;Ask me about Loom&quot; badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you&#x27;re a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It&#x27;s the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the serie…</span>

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game&#x27;s modes and chat functions – this happens &quot;rapidly,&quot; Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing &quot;approximately 100 matches,&quot; a…</span>

                              <span>There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, &quot;ooo yes, very nice&quot; and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, &quot;oh, why do you exist?&quot; There&#x27;s also a rare third class of Pokémon I call &quot;weird lil things&quot; when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class&#x27; newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it&#x27;s just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii&#x27;s video below: 


I&#x27;m most excited to see Wiglett&#x27;s evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I&#x27;ll see that in another trainer&#x27;s party because I&#x27;m not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>During our recent interview with Overwatch&#x27;s Vice President, Jon Spector, we asked the executive a few additional questions about developing sustainable revenue streams for free-to-play games. Titles like Fortnite and Warzone have popularized collaborations with major brands like Dragon Ball Super, Attack On Titan, and Snoop Dogg, so I was curious if the Overwatch team would consider it. 
&quot;We&#x27;ve seen some really fun examples out there of games working with other brands or other games,&quot; Spector says. &quot;I&#x27;m a big anime nerd myself. I think it&#x27;s super cool when I see Naruto appear in Fortnite. I don&#x27;t even play Fortnite, but that&#x27;s awesome. And as we look at the Overwatch 2 space, those are things that we&#x27;re interested in exploring. If and when we do that, one of our key values is to do it in …</span>

Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home planet to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 introduces a bevy of new characters, maps, and modes when it launches early next week. However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel&#x27;s new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass. The pass&#x27; free track allows players to unlock a new support character named Kiriko, while its premium track – which costs $10 or 1,000 Overwatch Coins – offers unique cyberpunk-themed cosmetics like weapon charms, souvenirs, and legendary skins. Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch&#x27;s new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins. 
We recently interviewed Overwatch 2&#x27;s leadership group to learn about their philosophy while developing the Battle Pass and Mythic Skins&#x27; role in the sequel&#x27;s revamped monetization …</span>

                              <span>At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity&#x27;s collapse a la the game&#x27;s prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what&#x27;s to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester&#x27;s impressions of that title here.</span>

                              <span>In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a &quot;world class event to serve the global gaming industry.&quot; The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea&#x27;s Game Rating committee, and it&#x27;s possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it&#x27;s unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama&#x27;s new game, Slitterhead.

                              <span>Marvel has stepped up its gaming output these past few years. Following the success of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man in 2018 by Insomniac Games, the team later announced Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, due out sometime next year. Insomniac is also working on a Wolverine game. Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it&#x27;s working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig&#x27;s new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There&#x27;s also Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year&#x27;s excellent Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
All of this is to say that Marvel has been pumping out a steady stream of games with more to come. However, despite that, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the company to create a co…</span>

                              <span>Night School Studio has delayed Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. 
Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn&#x27;t mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel &quot;truly special&quot; and to add more localizations. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s full statement on the delay:

                              <span>Are you ready to be sent to Camp ChillyWawa and Dr. Periowinkle&#x27;s mansion as an intelligence agent?
Armed with a book of knowledge, or Pink Digital Assistant, your mission will be to save children from dangerous threats and undo a spell cast on a little girl who has been transformed into a wombat. To succeed you will need to visit several countries and even travel into the past. On your way you will encounter historical monuments and exhibits.
The ScummVM team is proud to announce that The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril and The Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink are finally ready for their testing period.
If you want to help with the tests, use the latest daily build of ScummVM to play the Windows version of the games. Please report any issues you encounter on our bug tracker. Be sure to follow our testing and bug reporting guidelines.
