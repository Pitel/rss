                              <span>PC indeed
As someone who heretically prefers to play games on a controller, PC may not always be my first choice. But even I have to admit that it&#x27;s a platform that has some of the most compelling releases of the year, every year. When it&#x27;s easier for small, independent teams to publish to platforms like Steam or itch.io, the cream usually tends to rise to the top, so that PC is always one of the most stacked &quot;best of the year&quot; categories, in my opinion. 2022 was no exception, because this banger-filled list is making it really difficult to try and decide which game is gonna take my vote.
First you&#x27;ve got Signalis, which is not only an awesome tribute to classic horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but also one of the most stylish and heart-wrenching games I&#x27;ve played in a long…</span>

Following on from its official reveal at last week&#x27;s Game Awards, studio Housemarque has released the PC specifications for its wicked, chrono-confusing blaster Returnal — which, following its celebrated run on PS5, will finally be headed to the PC platform (via Steam) in early 2023.
As those who have played Returnal will attest, the sci-fi epic is a visually dazzling experience, jam-packed with sparkling effects, intricately designed enemies, and almost constant, even chaotic, action setpieces. The &quot;Recommended&quot; PC specs reflect this, asking for a pretty beefy 32GB in RAM, as well as an nVidia RTX 2070 (8GB) and a six-core processor. In addition, the specs strongly recommend that Returnal be installed on an SSD, with a footprint of 60GB.

                              <span>Vibing: the expansion
With few execeptions, World of Warcraft expansions generally deliver at launch. This is the honeymoon period. The part where you&#x27;re just getting to a new theme park for the first time, all the rides are fresh, and the food tastes good: before you start to get bored, and you realize they use too much salt.
WoW: Dragonflight takes a long time to get to that point: perhaps longer than most expansions in the series&#x27; history. It&#x27;s a great direction for WoW, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see if they keep it up.

World of Warcraft: Dragonflight (PC)
Developer: Blizzard
Publisher: Blizzard
Released: November 28, 2022
MSRP: $39.99

If there&#x27;s one thing can agree on about Persona 5&#x27;s cast of characters: They&#x27;re a good-looking bunch. of hipsters. And now, you too can adapt the visual style of your favorite heart-stealer or confidant, thanks to this mega make-up kit, now available to order from the face-plasterers at Game Beauty.
The Persona 5 x Game Beauty collection features a wide variety of lipsticks, shadows, pencils, blushers, and eyeliners, with colours and shades stylized after those lovable roustabouts, The Phantom Thieves. There are various items and sets available to order, ranging from bundles of character blushes to a $196 dollar Limited Edition set, which includes a variety of items from the new line in a slick collector&#x27;s box.

Each item is based on a different element of Persona 5. We have a palette for the thieves themselves, eyeshadow for the palaces, and lipstick and further shadows repping the individual personas.

All items ship globally (excluding Japan) and all products are cruelty-free and vegan-friendly. The set appears to have a vivid and delightful color palette, and is sure to get you looking pretty anime for the coming Holidays. Speaking of which, the makeup would also make a fine gift for the many beautiful Persona fans in your life. I&#x27;m hoping that just a few swabs of shadow and a dab of eyeliner will instantly turn me into Sae Niijima. This might be wishful thinking for The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse, but we all gotta dream...
The Persona x Game Beauty collection is available now from the Game Beauty website.

While the mid-&#x27;90s fast gave way to a love of 3D fighting titles, spearheaded by the success of Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Dead or Alive, there were still plenty of developers who knew that the 2D aesthetic was where it was at. And due to budgetary or stylistic reasons, some franchises retained the flat-planed approach to the act of kicking names and taking ass.
And while Street Fighter III might not have quite been the launch success Capcom had hoped, the love for the game demonstrated by the most &quot;hardcore&quot; of the fighting game community was enough to ensure that many 2D fighters would continue to spill into the market, particularly in Japan, where the traditional look was perhaps better appreciated by digital sluggers. And so, The King of Fighters,  Darkstalkers, Sa…</span>

                              <span>Not bad for a global playtest
Sega has announced that the most recent entry in its iconic Sonic the Hedgehog series, Sonic Frontiers, has smashed past 2.5 million global sales since its launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms earlier last month.
The new titles, which is considered to be the start of a fresh direction for the tumultuous platforming franchise, sees The Blue Blur whisked away to a strange and somewhat dystopian new world: The Starfall Islands. There, our hero embarks upon a quest to gather up the Chaos Emeralds and restore order, while locating the whereabouts of his equally at-sea friends. As the first truly &quot;open-world&quot; Sonic title, Sonic Frontiers aims to breath new life into the dice-roll series, offering up mechanics and features that are new to the Sonic the Hedgehog universe.

Launching on November 8, critics and fans have remained divisive in regard to the title, with some taking to the new direction, while others have felt that, while a gameplay overhaul was necessary, Sonic Frontiers&#x27; path isn&#x27;t quite &quot;it&quot;. The title also launched with various technical issues, with Sonic Team director likening the launch to a &quot;global playtest&quot;. A statement that understandably raised eyebrows among some of those who had just dropped $60 on the new title. On the whole, Sonic Frontiers has been seen as a positive for the franchise, offering hope that perhaps that gen-yoo-ine top-tier Sonic title could see the light of day... someday.
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Sony has yet to take them up on the offer
Microsoft&#x27;s attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard has been nothing if not messy, and now the newest concession Xbox&#x27;s parent company is making is to extend somewhat of an olive branch to Sony in the form of the Call of Duty franchise. More specifically, Microsoft would reportedly allow Sony to put Call of Duty in the PlayStation Plus subscription service for the first time. Bloomberg reports that Sony is yet to take this offer.
The easiest explanation for Microsoft&#x27;s sudden change of heart is likely the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s lawsuit, which was filed against the company under the suspicion that the acquisition would stifle competition in the games industry. If Microsoft allows their competitor to have more control of one of their most lu…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a tactics veteran on board, too
Adglobe and Binary Haze Interactive have announced their next project, heading into the realm of tactics. Redemption Reapers is a tactical RPG set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch in February 2023.
This new RPG is being developed by Adglobe and published by Binary Haze, both of which collaborated on 2021&#x27;s Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights. But rather than tackle the Metroidvania genre again, they&#x27;re looking towards tactics.
Redemption Reapers follows the Ashen Hawk Brigade as it battles against an invading legion. It looks very grim, with the hordes of monsters rampaging across the countryside.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rkYM9qfdXwU
Longtime Fire Emblem developer Masayuki Horikawa is working on the project, so it&#x27;s got some of that lineage. Redemption Reapers also has a strong voice cast cued up, and a fairly different look from the usual tactics RPG.
&quot;Following the success of Ender Lilies, we aimed to approach a new genre ideal for sharing our love of dark fantasy stories,&quot; said Binary Haze CEO Hiroyuki Kobayashi in a press release. &quot;Redemption Reapers’ tactical RPG combat and emotional storytelling combine for a memorable experience we cannot wait to share with the world in early 2023.&quot;
Search for redemption
We certainly saw a lot of tactics in 2022. Games like Tactics Ogre: Reborn, Triangle Strategy, and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope have made for a hefty backlog for most tactics fans.
Still, there&#x27;s always room for something fresh and new. Ender Lilies, from what I&#x27;ve seen other folks say about it, certainly seems like it did that. And Redemption Reapers could see this team-up work out for a surprise hit once again.
It won&#x27;t be a long wait, either way. Redemption Reapers aims to charge into a stacked early 2023 season, with a February launch window in mind. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up against the horde in a few months&#x27; time.

Every now and then, a game arrives late in the year to surprise us, right as the calendar is coming to a close. We&#x27;ve seen it with games like Omori, Gris, and Gorogoa. And this year, it really feels like Chained Echoes is surprising folks.
Chained Echoes is a new RPG from developer Matthias Linda, a communication designer who started working on the game in his spare time after work back in 2016. The project went on Kickstarter in 2019, and launched on December 8, 2022 for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC via Steam.
It would be fairly easy to call Chained Echoes a love letter to the SNES&#x27; golden age. It wears its inspirations so prominently on its sleeve, it opens with a direct reference to the start of Chrono Trigger. There&#x27;s no …</span>

Today marks the 20th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker’s Japanese release and after all of these years, we think that it is finally safe to say that Nintendo’s punt paid off. By ‘punt’ we don’t refer to the idea of putting Link on a boat – whatever will they think of next, putting him on a train?? – nor the chance to freely move the camera ourselves. We’re talking about the decision to take the grizzled hero of Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask and make him look like he had gone 12 rounds with Walt Disney.
In the ensuing 20 years, this so-called ‘Toon Link’ has appeared in a number of locations. From handheld series entries to Smash Bros. fighters and amiibo figures, this little guy has been there, done that and got the t-shirt (cue ‘Get Item’ sound effect); but the last time we saw him leading his own adventure was in Tri Force Heroes – securely hammering the final nail into the coffin of the cel-shaded hero.

As far as our expectations for Nintendo content go, last week&#x27;s The Game Awards was not half bad. We got first word of Bayonetta Origins, had a sneak peek at Hades II and Earthblade and much more besides (we broke it all down in our full round-up). But what was it like attending the event in person?
Fortunately, one of our wonderful video producers, Zion, was able make it over to L.A. this year and is here to answer that very question. In his latest video, Zion breaks down the event&#x27;s highs, lows and everything in between - trust us when we say that there is an anecdote or two to share from this one.

Wayforward is on the top level when it comes to long-standing indie developers. Sure, not every game is a winner but when they do land, the studio knocks it out of the park. A long history of bangers has made it one of the most respected developers in the game, and one genre it consistently excels in is the old-school beat ‘em’ up. Even with pedigree that includes the highly underappreciated Double Dragon Neon, we were shocked with just how amazing 2019’s River City Girls was, ending up as one of our favourite games in an extremely strong year. Three years later comes River City Girls 2, which continues the adventure of Misako and Kyoko in a strong follow-up that maybe treads too much familiar ground and stumbles a little, at least on Switch.
Right away we’re treated to another gorgeous animated opening, with another cracking intro song from Megan McDuffee. One of the standouts from the 2019 original was McDuffee&#x27;s fantastic soundtrack, and thankfully River City Girls 2 does not disappoint in that department. Each area of the game brings its own set of tracks, including the return of the vocal tracks themed to each boss, and even ventures into different genres with Mega Ran’s River City Girls Anthem. Luckily, if you liked the first game&#x27;s tunes a lot, they play throughout this game and are unlockables that can be played in your hideout.

Just as the World Cup really starts hotting up, New Star Games has announced that its arcade-inspired football sim, Retro Goal, will be following suit.
The studio has announced that a new tournament-based game mode will be kicking off in Retro Goal from today (13th December). What&#x27;s more, this expansion is absolutely free! Much like the World Cup itself, this new &#x27;Global Championship&#x27; mode is precisely what is says on the tin as you will be taking control of one of 32 different national teams in an attempt to take them all the way to the trophy.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake has dropped a brand-new trailer! THQNordic&#x27;s upcoming platformer sees everyone&#x27;s favourite sponge adventure through seven different worlds alongside his trusty companion, Balloon-Patrick, and the pair will have to fend off plenty of familiar faces along the way.
This spiritual successor to Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated will feel familiar to fans of that game, and will — of course — be stuffed full of references to famous episodes from the cartoon show and full of fan-favourite characters. And in THQ&#x27;s Boss Fight trailer, we see plenty of them — Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Gary, and more. We don&#x27;t want to hurt any of them, though, especially Gary!

Matías Schmied, the developer of the mystery platformer game Evan&#x27;s Remains, is back with his next project — and it&#x27;s out on Switch very soon. RE:CALL is an adventure game with visual novel elements, and publisher Whitehorn Games has revealed that you&#x27;ll be able to dive into memories and shape the present and future on Switch when the game releases on 17th January 2023!
RE:CALL will see you control ten different characters and interact with their memories to change the past. However, your choices will have consequences and will affect the immediate future. With adorable pixel graphics and gorgeous portraits (par the course for Schmied!), RE:CALL might look flashy in the trailer, but we have a feeling we&#x27;ll be thrown into some mind-bending twists as we try to discover why these ten people have this mysterious power.

                              <span>Triumph or Die.
Jitsu Squad is a beat &#x27;em up heavily inspired by &#x27;90s classics like belt-scroller Final Fight and fighter Marvel vs. Capcom. You control the titular squad as they seek to stop the evil demon Origami from getting his hands on the Kusanagi Stone, a legendary MacGuffin which grants godly powers to anyone who can attain it. After a successful Kickstarter in early 2021 and a Steam release in March this year, Dutch indie team Tanuki Creative Studio’s exhilarating debut has come to Switch with an adequate conversion that could use some touching up.
As you boot up the game, it’s immediately apparent where the inspirations for Jitsu Squad lie. The character select screen feels ripped out of Street Fighter Alpha, it has a Saturday morning cartoon-esque art style, and references to a host of Capcom classics. The game anchors itself on nostalgia for the Marvel Vs. Capcom games, with enemies with claws running around shouting “berserker barrage” and super moves having character cut-ins with the name of said move. Even animations like Aros’ shoulder bash are almost one-to-one recreations of Hulk from MVC.

Hideki Kamiya, Vice President of PlatinumGames and creator of Bayonetta, recently sat down with IGN Japan to discuss the future of the franchise, claiming that he could not envisage the series ever ending. When asked whether PlatinumGames would be up for making Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, this is what he had to say:

Fortunately, No Gravity Games is once again giving them out by the sack-load this December (if by &#x27;sack-load&#x27; you mean a maximum of 12, that is) as a part of the &#x27;12 Games of Christmas&#x27; - hey, it&#x27;s certainly one way of getting games out there.
The event began on 5th December and will run through until 16th December with a brand new game being made available for free on each day. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning right off the bat that this offer only applies to North American eShop accounts.

It might be December, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped video game releases from rushing out the door. The latest one is Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion - otherwise known as the prequel to the legendary 1997 RPG, Final Fantasy VII.
Crisis Core originally made its debut on the PlayStation Portable in 2007 and now returns with updated 3D models, full voiceovers, new music arrangements and much more. It stars Zack Fair, who is a rather important character in the Final Fantasy VII mythos. You can learn more in our review:

                              <span>When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game&#x27;s most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn&#x27;t quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you&#x27;re mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they&#x27;ve done with FF7 Remake).
It&#x27;s with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7&#x27;s PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix&#x27;s ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I&#x27;ll say this. If you don&#x27;t already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that&#x27;s received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 struggled to quickly apply fixes for issues with its heroes during Season 1, but Blizzard say they’ve managed to sort all that out for the recently minted hero shooter. A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

                              <span>As I lay in bed at 6am today, crying, I knew: it&#x27;s time. They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that&#x27;s not an observation, it&#x27;s an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.

                              <span>It’s been 17 years and a week since Brokeback Mountain happened, and indie dev Robert Yang has taken the spirit of the movie and turned it into a free to play romance visual novel. That Lonesome Valley lets you play out the relationship between two young herders working alone together out in the American wilderness. Yang gives a content warning for the game, which contains pixel art nudity and sex sequences. You can watch the first ten minutes of That Lonesome Valley below.

                              <span>The strategic superheroics of Marvel’s Midnight Suns might make it a Bestest Bests winner, but tragically, it does come yoked to the dreadful 2K Launcher. A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns&#x27; stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you&#x27;re playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

That’s what devs Housemarque and publisher PlayStation have listed for Returnal’s recommended system requirements though. Shush, don’t tell anyone, but I don’t have that much RAM in my machine. Doing a straw poll of RPS staff, most of us don&#x27;t. Except James, who&#x27;s looking very pleased with himself right now.

This has an unfortunate heavy impact on the system and thus the detector was added to report it to the kernel log when a split-lock occurs. But earlier this year starting with Linux 5.19, kernel developers decided to &quot;make life miserable&quot; and intentionally slow down bad behaving apps that abuse split-locks. That in turn has caused problems for some games -- so far select Windows games running under Steam Play -- and thus a new kernel knob is being added to more easily adjust the behavior...</span>

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

Licensed video games have always been like the interior of an abandoned barn. Sometimes you might find a long-abandoned car that is in dire need of restoration, but more likely, it’s just full of spiders. Die Hard on NES is neither of those things. It’s more like finding a long-abandoned lunar lander in an old barn. You wonder how it got there and if it’s a good idea to try it out.
It’s an absolutely bizarre game that transcends the discussion of whether it’s good or crap. It’s fascinating. The design is something that isn’t exactly without comparison, but the way it functions is out of this world.

Haaaaans!
I’d recommend watching Die Hard before playing this game. While knowing the movie is rarely needed for playing the licensed game, it’s practically requir…</span>

I have a confession to make. I love buying gifts for people. Birthdays, Secret Santa, weddings, you name it, I look forward to the challenge! And the reason is that I used to be an absolutely terrible gift giver. I once gave a grown man a box of tea bags and a USB bracelet that ended up being too small to fit around his wrist.
I&#x27;m still embarrassed by these gifts, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. I&#x27;ve been on my gift-giving game ever since. Now I&#x27;m here to help you! You&#x27;re already moving in the right direction by pinpointing a favorite hobby. Here are 10 gift ideas to get you thinking about the gamer in your life.

The year is coming to a close, and so it&#x27;s time to look back at what 2022 held, particularly for Xbox fans. Microsoft had a seemingly quiet year, but this year&#x27;s nominees for Destructoid&#x27;s best-in-class Xbox games spoke volumes.
As a reminder, our awards season here at Destructoid runs December-to-December. So while Halo Infinite wasn&#x27;t eligible last year, it is this year, and it&#x27;s likely better off for it. While 343 Industries&#x27; FPS struggled right out of the gate, a series of updates have been gradually turning the narrative around. The recent Forge beta and quality-of-life improvements are starting to make Infinite feel a bit more like what folks might have hoped for at launch, and so it&#x27;s worth noting that.

Project Lumina has some lovely news for fans of anime fighter Melty Blood: Type Lumina, as two new characters will be joining the roster as soon as Thursday, December 15 — Better yet, both Ushiwakamaru and The Count of Monte Cristo will be made available to all players absolutely free of charge!
In addition to the amusingly named two combatants, (guest stars from Fate/Grand Order) the new update will also add two new stages — the grim Prison Tower: Hall and the isolated Face of the Surging Waves — as well as brand new subtitle options for Spanish, French, Brazilian, and Portuguese players.

                              <span>Can you even buy a PS5 yet?
2022 has been a pretty action-packed year for Sony&#x27;s premier gaming brand. And while arguably the first year that saw its two-year-old platform, PlayStation 5, accelerate its sales past the 25 million mark, the past 12 months have still seen a wide variety of new releases squeezed onto its best-selling predecessor, PS4, hardware that simply refuses to go gently into that good night.
Even visual stunners such as Guerrilla Games&#x27; Horizon Forbidden West and Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War Ragnarok were causing the PS4&#x27;s modest CPU to sweat away, ensuring that the full transition to the ninth generation remains mired in a strange limbo. It&#x27;s a good situation for the players, as the PS4 has an incredible install base of over 100 million users. But, as someone who previously worked retail for many generations, I can&#x27;t remember a gaming generation that took this long to become mainline.
Still, there were some PS5-only releases, many of which boasted incredible visuals, dazzling effects, and very welcome high-speed load times. All in, it&#x27;s a pretty good time to be a PlayStation owner. Many new titles are still compatible with PS4, while its bigger brother spearheads the charge into the next half-decade of gaming... Even if the physical console itself is still far, far too large for anybody&#x27;s TV stand.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid&#x27;s Best PlayStation Game of 2022:
Cult of The Lamb
Elden Ring
God of War: Ragnarok
Horizon Forbidden West
Sifu
Stranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin
Stray

It looks like updates for Mario Strikers: Battle League are coming to a close, and they&#x27;re doing it with two familiar faces. The Wave 3 update adds Bowser Jr. and Birdo to the soccer title, in what Nintendo says is the final free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Shown off in the latest trailer, Bowser Jr. is a balanced competitor with accurate passes. I guess the little dude learned teamwork somewhere. Birdo, meanwhile, is an offensive powerhouse with powerful shots. See them in action below:

While Mario Strikers has added three batches of post-launch characters and other updates, like special gear and arenas, it looks like the free updates are coming to a close. Over on social media, Nintendo UK says this is the &quot;final free update&quot; for Mario Strikers: Battle League.
Though the door may still be open for paid DLC somewhere down the line, it looks like this particular sports spinoff is coming to a close soon.
End of regulation
Mario Strikers: Battle League went live back in June of this year, and it seemed to deliver some high-octane soccer to fans. Soccer hadn&#x27;t seen much love in the Mario sports-sphere in some time, so it was nice to see this particular line of spin-offs get a new entry.
While most of the Switch-era sports spinoffs have seen a decent number of free post-launch updates, it&#x27;s sad to see this particular one come to a close. Whether this means we&#x27;ll see another entry on the way soon or not isn&#x27;t clear yet, but since the Switch seems to be sticking around a while, I&#x27;m hopeful we see some other sports entries revived. Mario needs to play some baseball again, is all I&#x27;m saying.
The third free update for Mario Strikers: Battle League goes live on December 13.

Bandai Namco has proudly announced that Tekken 7, one of the longest-life fighting games of all time, has smashed past an amazing 10 million sales. The announcement was made on the official Tekken Twitter, accompanied by an image of the entire cast at a very confusing dinner party, where people seem to float in mid-air, perspective is for the weak, and Kazumi brought a tiger.
Tekken 7 initially launched in Japanese arcades in the spring of 2015 (yep), before the expanded and rebalanced Fated Retribution hit the coin-op market one year later. This edition of the game would launch on PC and consoles worldwide in the summer of 2017 as simply Tekken 7. Since launch, the development has rolled out a lengthy series of DLC updates, bringing with them new modes, mech…</span>

                              <span>I just completed it recently, with two full playthroughs
The way I engage with every Pokemon is basically the same, dating back to the original generation.
I&#x27;ll finish an initial run with my game of choice (anything that resembles the color red is usually where I drift toward, going back to my original choice of Pokemon Red) and get every single Pokemon possible, then buy a copy of the other version. I&#x27;ll scour that, and transfer all of the exclusives back to the original version. I managed to finish that whole process (amid a ton of other work in this busy year!) recently, and wanted to check in with the community and see where they were at. Or if y&#x27;all even care!

Last week&#x27;s Game Award festivities were certainly filled to bursting point with trailers, updates, reveals, and wooorld premierees — But while many of the titles on show are prepping themselves for launch on PlayStation, PC, and/or Nintendo Switch, there was a distinct lack of Xbox exclusive titles, or games that in development at Xbox-adjacent studios.
After the curtain fell on Keighley-fest &#x27;22, some Xbox fans took to social media to express their concern, disappointed that they didn&#x27;t walk away with their own Death Stranding 2, Forspoken, or Bayonetta Origins. Vice President of Xbox Marketing, Aaron Greenberg, seemingly took note of this, and soon popped up on Twitter with a brief message hoping to reassure Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S owners.

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series, which rolled out across late 2021 and early 2022 feature the original games in their entirety, spruced up with crisp HD visuals, overhauled U.I., tweaked gameplay, and beautifully rearranged scores, overseen by Final Fantasy&#x27;s veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu. For younger fans, it&#x27;s an ideal way to experience a little bit of RPG history, and porting the remasters to additional platforms will only spread the legacy of these iconic releases even further.

Oh geez High on Life. You know, like, on one hand I&#x27;m keen on the whole &quot;Justin Roiland voice&quot; shtick, especially when it comes to Solar Opposites. But oh man....on the other....it&#x27;s getting a little old, you know? Especially if most people in those worlds feel like they&#x27;re just riffing, like everything is a stream of consciousness...like we&#x27;re all just...part of one big galactic party that never ends? Like how Shrek was mostly just a series of riffs from the actors, and a lot of it didn&#x27;t work? Look it up! On...Wikipedia...or Bing...or something.

Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn&#x27;t a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.

Xbox Head of Gaming Phil Spencer raised eyebrows this weekend with sharp remarks aimed at rivals Sony PlayStation — In an interview with the Second Request podcast, Spencer opined that the way PlayStation grows its brand is by shrinking the perceived size of the Xbox zeitgeist.
&quot;Sony is trying to protect its dominance on the console. The way they grow is by making Xbox smaller,&quot; said Spencer (as noted by VGC). &quot;[Sony] has a very different view of the industry than we do. They don&#x27;t ship their games day and date on PC, they do not put their games into their subscription [service] when they launch their games.&quot;
Spencer&#x27;s candid comments come at a particularly stressful time for the Xbox brand, which continues to hit wall after wall in pare…</span>

No longer are my opponents just names on a screen: they&#x27;re now names on a screen who I know have contributed to the 159 million Vibranium cards drawn during the Vibranium Forge event. It&#x27;s neat to see some silly stats, even neater to see a Black Panther with a power level that tops 8 million. A normal number would be, like, 16.

Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon&#x27;s Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they&#x27;re treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

                              <span>Football may not have come home this year, but it is coming to Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0. A limited-time mode introduced with Season 01 Reloaded&#x27;s launch on Wednesday will see two teams of three knocking a big football about on ATVs equipped with special pulse abilities, in classic Rocket League fashion. 
The developers are also bringing back Mini Royale, popping up a new building in the DMZ mode, and adding a new map to the multiplayer mode that you actually need to own Modern Warfare 2 for.

Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has confirmed that more updates are on the way, using his Game Awards victory speech to announce that they&#x27;re working on &quot;several more things&quot; for Elden Ring. He also mentioned he plans to &quot;create even more interesting games&quot;, if a triumph like Elden Ring still isn&#x27;t good enough for you.

                              <span>Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent&#x27;s crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I&#x27;ve played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won&#x27;t pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

                              <span>The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX hark back to a simpler time – about three months ago – when graphics cards resembled graphics cards and not Coca-Cola lorries. I like getting a bajillion frames per second as much as the next PC owner, but good gravy, are the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 a pair of oversized, ruinously expensive brutes. AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

After nearly three years in development and releases on Android, Linux, and through itch.io, Unciv’s now moving its units onto Steam. You&#x27;ll be able to play multiplayer Unciv, but that involves using Dropbox for syncing, which isn’t free to use.

You can still unlock 70 of the things via Ubisoft Connect, which launches automatically when you boot the game up on Steam anyway - so the only functional difference is that your achievements won&#x27;t all be in the same place. People don&#x27;t love that, which is fair, but let&#x27;s keep our heads now.

CTV News report that parents of three Canadian children who regularly play Fortnite claim the game was created to be “highly addictive”, and allege the battle royale has caused their kids psychological and physical problems, along with financial issues. Although the families are seeking damages from Epic, no figure has been put on those yet. Epic has 30 days to appeal the case or it’ll go to trial.

Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

                              <span>And the soundtracks are coming to streaming services.
Hold the phone, readers — it&#x27;s Snowboard Kids&#x27; (Snowboard Kiiiiiiids~) 25th anniversary, and we now feel really ancient. More importantly, the game&#x27;s publisher, Atlus, acknowledged the game&#x27;s birthday by announcing that all the games&#x27; soundtracks would be available on streaming services on Christmas day!
If you missed out on this back in the day, Snowboard Kids is one of the greatest snowboarding games around — 1080 Snowboarding wishes it could be this good (we kid, we kid). But this colourful Mario Kart take on snowboarding saw you play as one of six racers — Slash, Nancy, Jam, Tommy, Linda, or Shinobin — each with a fun design and personality traits that meant each of us at Nintendo Life Towers has one we can relate to the most. (This writer always liked Nancy because look at those &#x27;90s-as-heck pink dungarees and those bunny ears — and she always donned a lot of pink on the slopes, too.)

                              <span>Water water everywhere.
Ah, water. Calming, tranquil, fun. You’d struggle to find a game that doesn’t have some body of water in it. But Wavetale dives into the deep end. This adventure title from Thunderful sees players exploring by walking, running, and gliding on water. Initially released for Stadia, it has now spread to PC and consoles. For the most part, it’s relaxing to play, although it struggles a little on Switch.
Wavetale takes place in the aptly-named Strandville, a town that has been literally and figuratively flooded by baddies known as the Dirty Paws. You play as heroine Sigrid – a sarcastic, cynical young adult whose temperament comes through in the talented voice over actor’s sighs and mumbles. She lives with a grandmother who won’t even let her dip her toe in the surrounding sea, because the world beyond is covered with dark perilous clouds (‘Gloom’). Naturally, she longs to explore those uncharted waters.

At last week&#x27;s The Game Awards show, Nintendo and Illumination unveiled a new clip from the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie, showcasing the main guy himself exploring Mushroom Kingdom alongside Keegan-Michael Key&#x27;s character, Toad.
Something that long-time fans of Mario will have immediately noticed was the lovely background music, which was almost entirely comprised of tunes inspired by the video game series. While it probably isn&#x27;t necessary to point out which game each and every tune comes from (we know you&#x27;re a clever bunch, after all), it&#x27;s nevertheless fun to see it in practice. Which is why YouTuber SuperWiiBros08 has uploaded a new video highlighting which Mario game each tune was inspired by.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

Epic Games is facing a class-action lawsuit from parents who claim that the team knowingly developed Fortnite to be highly addictive (thanks, TechRadar).
Concern over the game&#x27;s level of addiction have been a hot topic of conversation for a good few years now. The lawsuit was first opened up back in 2019, with lawyers claiming that Epic Games hired psychologists to assist in making the title as addictive as possible and provided players with no warnings of these effects. The case has been under review ever since and has now been deemed worthy of approval.

Teased during the OG Unwrapped Presentation earlier this year, Outright Games has now announced that it will be bringing DC&#x27;s Justice League: Cosmic Chaos to the Switch for some family-friendly fun on 10th March, 2023.
If you were to look at the state of the DCEU at the moment, the phrase &#x27;family friendly&#x27; might not immediately spring to mind. You&#x27;ve got several iterations of Batman beating seven shades out of criminals, two attempts at a Justice League movie which are better off forgotten and projects being cancelled left, right and centre. Nonetheless, PHL Collective and Outright Games have looked at this landscape and and decided that a family-friendly open-world adventure is the way to go - fair enough!

We seem to be learning more and more about Super Mario Bros. The Movie each day, with official announcements, regional differences and leaks contributing to the growing mound of material. The latest addition to join the pile is a McDonald&#x27;s advert - reportedly showing in Portugal - which contains brand new footage of a much more capable looking Mario in action (thanks, Nintenduo).
The latest advert (below) appears to have been pulled straight out of the early 2000s, it is true, but it does provide a first look at what Mario might be like once he gains a better understanding of his abilities. Here hurdling a Toad before wall jumping up a set of item boxes to avoid the pearly whites of a trio of Piranha Plants, this isn&#x27;t the Mario-in-training that we have seen in the past few trailers but one that appears a lot more ready to get let&#x27;s-a-go-ing.

Soon after, the music group requested compensation for over $250,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees. Yout has now asked the court to put this matter on hold while its appeal over the legality of youtube-dl-based software is heard at the appeals court.

A California court has just awarded the plaintiffs $20.7m in damages plus $417,600 to cover attorneys&#x27; fees.

Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series.

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey.

After two perfectly fine, if not wildly amazing, track packs, Nintendo has managed to put together a wave of DLC that is eight tracks, zero skips, swear to God. Not only are these top-tier tracks from Mario Kart&#x27;s past and present, but this is the first time the developers have really tried to lean into the gameplay innovations of Mario Kart 8, i.e., the anti-gravity mechanic. In revisiting these tracks, the developers have deftly added this feature where they can, even if it&#x27;s just for a moment. None of the tracks here follow the footsteps of Wave 2&#x27;s Sky-High Sundae, which was entirely anti-grav, but that&#x27;s okay.

Good Saturday, my darlings, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing. You find The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse at the end of a pretty exhausting week, packed out with behind-the-scenes dealings at Destructoid, mired in three games for review, and suffering from a severe lack of sleep. Reasons unknown. In addition, we just had The Geoff Awards 2022, and we&#x27;re prepping Destructoid&#x27;s own GOTY antics.
It&#x27;s been a pretty hectic and tiresome seven days for me, and, in its own way, I&#x27;m sure it has for you. But all that matters is that, right now, it&#x27;s Saturday morning, and we&#x27;ve gotten together for this weekly sewing circle of the great and good of gaming. I hope we can enjoy some great chatter, some shared experiences, and plenty of smiles this week, and I hope that your…</span>

[Update: Today is your final opportunity to sign up for next week&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 open beta.]
Capcom has announced that it will be holding a second closed beta later this month for the highly anticipated release Street Fighter 6 — Once again, the invite-only test run will be open to PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X players, and will take place from December 16 until December 19.
Interested parties should sign up at the official beta application website. Capcom has decreed that, due to the unlicensed selling of codes from October&#x27;s beta, all participants MUST have their platform and Capcom ID linked in order to receive direct access to the test beta. The chosen participants will be picked by random lottery, not on a first-come, first-served basis.

It&#x27;s no secret narrative games are my all-time favorites. I went into this year&#x27;s Game Awards not expecting much, but little did I know I&#x27;d be punched in the face over and over again with some incredible game trailers. There are a ton of great games to look forward to over the next couple of years (many of which are not on this list), but I had to take the time to highlight some of the games that have me amped.
It&#x27;s actually a pretty good mix of DLC and sequels to some of my favorite titles, and also some new IPs that will be breaking out onto the scene with their debut title. Regardless, I walked away from the show more impressed than I have been in a long time -- it seems the Awards hit at just the right part of the these games&#x27; d…</span>

World of Warcraft&#x27;s Corrupted Blood pandemic from back in 2005 is one of the most notorious, and yet fascinating, things to ever happen in the game. It even has its own Wikipedia page titled &quot;The Corrupted Blood Incident.&quot; For those who may not be familiar, basically what happened was that there was a debuff associated with a certain boss fight at the end of a raid. The debuff could pass between players in close proximity, and while it was intended to be active only in the boss&#x27; region, a bug allowed Corrupted Blood to spread across the entirety of Azeroth, the game&#x27;s fictional world.
It&#x27;s an uncanny phenomenon given what we&#x27;ve experienced over the past few years. The Incident was so good at replicated how disease spreads in the real world, in fact,…</span>

Following on from last week&#x27;s much-celebrated and long-awaited release of Tetris: The Grand Master, retro publisher Hamster returns to its bag big of Namco classics this week, with the arrival of 3D maze chaser Pac-Mania, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1987, before finding itself ported to myriad home computers and consoles, Pac-Mania was something of a very big deal upon its launch, due to its fresh adaptation of Pac-Man&#x27;s genre-defining gameplay from an all-new 3D perspective. Choosing an oblique 3/4 viewing angle, and sporting some delightfully cartoonish sprites, Pac-Mania offered a new approach to the pill-munching action of its 1980 predecessor.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber MegaMan52.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ctJFLJ5w88U
Once again, our boy is charged with dashing around a symmetrical maze, gobbling up power pellets, and staying one step ahead of the ghostly gang of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde, and &quot;Sue&quot;. As a major game-changer, Pac-Man now has the ability to leap over his enemies, offering him a handy escape when cornered. Later stages introduce new ghosts... erm... &quot;Funky and Spunky&quot; both of whom also have the ability to take to the air, intercepting Pac-Man&#x27;s avian action. A popular release in arcades and on the home market, Pac-Mania remains one of the most recognizable of the Pac-Man sequels.
Pac-Mania is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. It should be noted that it is also included as part of Bandai Namco&#x27;s compendium Pac-Man Museum +.

                              <span>The &quot;extensive similarities&quot; have Riot pushing for damages
Riot Games is suing over the similarities it&#x27;s found in a NetEase game to its own Valorant. A new suit filed by Riot claims that NetEase&#x27;s Hyper Front is a copy of the tactical shooter Valorant.
As reported on by Polygon, Riot has field suit over NetEase&#x27;s Hyper Front, which is also a team-based tactical shooter. According to the filing, Riot claims Hyper Front is a copy of &quot;substantial parts&quot; of Valorant.
Valorant launched on PC in 2020, and Riot is currently developing a mobile version. Meanwhile, Hyper Front was released in 2022 for mobile platforms on iOS and Android.
In the suit, Riot lays out the similarities. It&#x27;s not just the number of players, but Riot points directly at maps, character designs, weapons, and even the raw numbers from the weapons. There are actual spreadsheets in the filing, comparing the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;qRao6FARFRo
Rushing the point
Riot does note that NetEase made modifications to Hyper Front following the first complaints. However, the infringement goes further.
&quot;All of our creative choices are mirrored in NetEase’s game,&quot; said Riot Games layer Dan Nabel to Polygon. &quot;We don’t think that changing the color of a character ability or slightly modifying the visual appearance changes the fact that it’s copyright infringement. It’s like that old saying, ‘You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.&#x27;&quot;
Riot Games is seeking an injunction, which would likely essentially shut down Hyper Front, and &quot;substantial&quot;, but unspecified, figures for damages. It&#x27;s also litigating the claim in several courts around the world.
&quot;We don’t want to rely on one particular market to have this issue resolved,&quot; Nabel told Polygon. &quot;NetEase is a global publisher, as are we. We want them to know that we take the matter very seriously.&quot;

                              <span>The 2022 Game Awards kicked off in a big way. Not with a new blockbuster world premiere or a stunning upset, but with Scarface himself walking out on stage to deliver the award for best video game performance. Al Pacino clearly owed someone a favor, or a lot of money, and we are all the richer for it.

Aptly titled Hades 2, the game is currently being developed for an early access release, with news on the game coming in 2023.

                              <span>Amazon Basics have produced some great computer gear in their history - memorably, once selling a full-size mechanical keyboard for £23 that I reviewed and found surprisingly good value for money. Today though, it&#x27;s something different: an Amazon Basics branded Micro SD card in a 256GB capacity, selling for just £15.67 rather than its UK RRP of £26.99. 
Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned about the card, and why I reckon it&#x27;s worth picking up if you&#x27;re in need for a memory card for your Steam Deck, Switch or whatever.

This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a &quot;wildcard condition&quot; called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

It&#x27;s time to grab hold of it again, comfort it with a few tender strokes, then gorge on its innards to pay for some of the splendid turn-based strategy games on sale in Steam&#x27;s TurnBasedFest.
There are decent discounts for Katharine&#x27;s beloved Dorfromantik, my beloved Slipways, and many generally beloved digified board games. Most of the sales end on December 12th, so don&#x27;t spend too long thinking about it. Reality&#x27;s turn-timers aren&#x27;t optional.

                              <span>The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that&#x27;s just my bad decisions talking. You&#x27;re stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It&#x27;s not super secret, but I almost don&#x27;t want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because we&#x27;ve done our own awards, and who needs a live show with a smiley man in clean, clean trainers when you&#x27;ve got a list of the games and things in games that we liked for reasons too specific to get a category on stage? Also, none of them are Elden Ring.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they&#x27;re bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren&#x27;t check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn&#x27;t a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don&#x27;t think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I&#x27;ll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

I am a chump who likes shiny things, so the release of Portal with RTX on Steam pleases me. It&#x27;s free if you own Portal, but fellow chumps should be aware that it&#x27;s not running too hot for everyone, with reports of crashes and literally too-hot GPUs. Ray-tracing does not come cheap.

How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children&#x27;s hospital.

Not so for Barney Calhoun, who fought his way free of the facility back in Valve&#x27;s 2001 Half-Life expansion, Blue Shift. Modding team HECU Collective have been forcing him to run that gauntlet again, so far releasing 3 chapters to their mod for Black Mesa - not the fictional company, but the very real (and good) fan remake of the original Half-Life.
Chapter 4: Captive Freight comes out tomorrow, so it&#x27;s a fine time to jump in.

Though the TGAs proper were full of big games, names, and announcements, the indie showcase was no slouch, highlighting over a dozen exciting indies. One of the most notable was Spirittea, a life-sim where you manage a bathhouse, build relationships with the local NPCs and help various spirits that only you can see. Sort of a Spirited Away meets Stardew Valley proposition.

In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year&#x27;s Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, I thought, &quot;Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware&#x27;s use of grey&quot;. Even though there isn&#x27;t a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey&#x27;s redemption arc?

                              <span>Speaking as a grown-ass man, I love trains. Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

                              <span>In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

                              <span>Last night at The Game Awards, we learned that not only will there be a Hades 2, but it will be making the absolutely correct choice of letting Zagreus step aside to make way for a new protagonist. This time around we&#x27;ll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She&#x27;s also Zag&#x27;s half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

The paranormal game leans heavily into the PSX generation of survival horrors, with its fixed camera angles and even optional tank controls. The developers describe it as &quot;both a tribute and a modern take on classic horror games.&quot;

                              <span>Soulslike RPG The Lords Of The Fallen debuted its first gameplay trailer last night at The Game Awards, showcasing its violent combat, grotesque creature designs, and beautifully grim setting. The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

                              <span>The Geoffries tonight saw the announcement of a new cooperative heist FPS with set in the 90s, with an extremely 90s cast. 90s actors featuring in Crime Boss: Rockay City include Michael Madsen, Kim Basinger, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, and even Vanilla Ice and Chuck Norris. The game looks a whole lot like Payday but honestly, I&#x27;m always up for more heists. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Game Awards, we got to see a short teaser trailer for the latest game to come under EA&#x27;s Originals label. It&#x27;s called Immortals of Aveum, and it&#x27;s being made by the recently-formed Ascendant Studios - which you might remember is Dead Space creative director Bret Robbins&#x27; new thing. Details about the first-person magic shoot &#x27;em up are slim, but the trailer shows off some flashy magical spells and a fantasy city in crisis. You can watch the teaser reveal below.

Good job you’re around to give it a jolly good thwacking in action-survival game Remnant 2, a sequel to Remnant: From The Ashes announced during The Game Awards tonight. Your do-gooder can play solo or team up to sort out some pretty unpleasant monstrosities with up to two pals. Have a glance at the trailer below to see some very creepy beasties, and hear someone absolutely wail on their axe.

                              <span>For the longest time, FromSoftware were best known for their Armored Core series of middling mech games. Then they found a whole new audience with Demon&#x27;s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, and nary a big robot in sight. Well, now FromSoft are returning to big stompy boys with Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon, coming in 2023. Check out the cool mechs in the announcement trailer from tonight&#x27;s Geoffries, below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that&#x27;s the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight&#x27;s Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix&#x27;s next JRPG epic won&#x27;t be landing on &quot;other platforms&quot; until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that FF16&#x27;s PC release won&#x27;t be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we&#x27;ve seen in its new &quot;Revenge&quot; trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

                              <span>Right, here’s where I have to stay objective and professional. I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle. Just watch the trailer below and tell me what you think, go on.

                              <span>Man, I was never much of a Flash liker, but even I feel a bit sorry for him in tonight&#x27;s new trailer for Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. He gets a right old beating in the new Game Awards footage, but thankfully it looks like The Batman will be on hand to deliver some much needed... justice (sorry) when it comes out on May 26th 2023. Maybe. Miss you, Kevin Conroy.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of a report claiming that Diablo IV developers are likely facing painful overtime to meet a then-unconfirmed release date of June 6th, a new trailer at the Geoffries tonight confirmed that yeah Diablo IV&#x27;s release date is June 6th. Well. Alrighty. Still, this CGI trailer is nice and fancy.

                              <span>I was astonished by the announcement of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, never expecting a sequel to actually happen, so I&#x27;m pleased to see a new trailer at this year&#x27;s Geoffries. This &quot;gameplay reveal trailer&quot; only has a few wee snippets of the game being played, but they&#x27;re solid. As our boy Spice Maureen stomps through vast Gothic industrial ruins and cuts through hordes of aliens, it&#x27;s got that &#x27;Dynasty Warriors meets God Of War&#x27; look again. But I do already miss the Orks.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Nod are still primarily associated with Life Is Strange and a handful of other narrative-focused adventure games. Back in 2018, however, they also made action RPG Vampyr, which mixed more substantial combat among their usual focus on story. 

It&#x27;s in this vein that Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden seems to continue. It&#x27;s an action RPG about &quot;two proficient ghost hunters and lovers&quot; set in the haunted, frozen wilderness of 1695 North America. You can watch the reveal trailer below.

Earthblade is a high-fantasy exploration game that takes place in a ruined world with magic and monsters. It looks pretty cool, so check out the trailer below.

The exact timing of the Company Of Heroes 3 Console Edition is yet to be confirmed, but it will mark the first time Relic&#x27;s historical real-time strategy game will be available to play outside of PC. However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game&#x27;s multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have &quot;no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch&quot;.

                              <span>Anime is a Good Thing. There, I said it. Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain&#x27;t bad either (that&#x27;s one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It&#x27;s being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

And it shows! The game certainly looks like an ARPG, akin to say, Torchlight, with heroes battling against shadowy monsters to earn lots of rare and epic and legendary loot. It looks fine, good and dandy, so why not give the reveal trailer below a nice little watch?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a full year since ex-BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn and his new studio Inflexion announced Nightingale at The Game Awards. In case you&#x27;ve forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven&#x27;t heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game&#x27;s blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

Devs Larian Studios have shared a new trailer at The Game Awards, revealing that the RPG threequel will head out of early access in August 2023. Not only that, but some well-known heroes from the first two games are returning too. Watch the trailer below to see how old hands Jaheira and Minsc are faring these days, and get a peek at the city of Baldur’s Gate.

It shares a fair bit in common with Levine&#x27;s previous work too, judging by the trailer shown during The Game Awards tonight. You’re the unfortunately named Judas, a mysterious figure trapped on a starship that’s falling to bits. Our Judas is also surrounded by some not very nice folks. See for yourself by watching the trailer below.

We got another glimpse at Inflexion&#x27;s survival craft ‘em up during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, which showed off some of the magical enchantments you’ll get to encounter. Case in point: flying brollies. Have a watch below and tell me this don’t look like a right lark, guv’nor. What? I’m British, I can talk like Dick Van Dyke if I want.

                              <span>A new trailer for Destiny 2: Lightfall hot and fresh out of The Geoffries tonight certainly makes the next expansion for Bungie&#x27;s MMOFPS look cool. Neomuna, the neon capital megacity of Neptune, is very pretty. The new &#x27;Strand&#x27; powers of grappling hooks and rope darts look dead cool. Bungie always have good trailers. It doesn&#x27;t show any of the mindnumbing grind you&#x27;ll be forced through to play the best bits but hey, that&#x27;s trailers.

Announced during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, this sequel to 2020&#x27;s bestest best game breaks from the story of Zagreus to instead follow Hades&#x27; ruthless daughter Melinoe.

A roguelite action adventure developed by Upstream Arcade and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, Web Of Wyrd was revealed at tonight’s Game Awards. It&#x27;s the first game to star Hellboy since 2008&#x27;s Hellboy: The Science Of Evil. You can see Big Red in action by giving the trailer below the ol’ watcheroonie.

There is a new trailer however, shown tonight during The Game Awards, and it continues to convince me that Atomic Heart won&#x27;t be short on spectacular setpieces.

                              <span>Russia has sent a record number of takedown requests to Google in the first half of this year. In the past, copyright infringement was the most cited reason for action but that has been replaced by &#x27;national security&#x27;, currently a top priority for Russia. Google, however, is wary of overbroad censorship and hasn&#x27;t complied with most requests.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s campaign against pirate IPTV will receive a big boost if new amendments are signed into law. ISPs must aim to block unlicensed streams immediately but certainly within 30 minutes. The proposal was signed by Senator Claudio Lotito, who happens to own top-tier football club Lazio and is currently the vice-president of Italy&#x27;s Budget Commission.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Final Fantasy 16 has a release date. Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Square Enix revealed the game will be released on June 22, 2023.
Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It&#x27;s called Judas, and if you&#x27;re a BioShock fan, you&#x27;ll be happy with what you&#x27;re about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock&#x27;s footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine&#x27;s work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
&quot;You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?&quot;


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They&#x27;ve been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we&#x27;d see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team&#x27;s first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it&#x27;s nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn&#x27;t have a release window, but it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio&#x27;s vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019&#x27;s Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/9/2022:
A &quot;brief playable teaser&quot; for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, &quot;Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser.&quot;
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series&#x27; traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character&#x27;s combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola&#x27;s only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.</span>

Returnal is a roguelike third-person shooter developed by Housemarque, and was one of the first exclusives released on PS5 when it came out in April 2021. You play as Selene Vassos, an astronaut that finds herself stuck in a time loop on an alien planet. It made an appearance at last year&#x27;s game awards as well, where it was nominated for three awards and won Best Action Game. If you want to learn more about the game, you can read our review, where we called it &quot;a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola&#x27;s Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game&#x27;s methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


&quot;Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, it&#x27;s clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola&#x27;s original Hellboy comics. It&#x27;s easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we&#x27;ll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

                              <span>Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn&#x27;t reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game&#x27;s Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula&#x27;s castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell&#x27;s gameplay, three &quot;epic&quot; boss fights, and 20 outfits from &quot;Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.&quot;
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during &quot;Q1&quot; 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</span>

The mode will be added to the game on December 9, though little else was shared about the game.

                              <span>As a surprise ahead of The Game Awards, Vampire Survivors has been released for free on iOS and Android. Both versions are available now. You can find the iOS version here and the Android version here.


Vampire Survivors is an indie roguelike RPG where the player has to avoid hordes of monsters, undead, and (you guessed it) vampires. As you destroy enemies, you progress through a randomized skill tree to unlock new weapons and abilities. To get a better idea of the game, you can read our review, where we called it a “Single-Stick Masterpiece.”
In other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell. It comes with eight new survivors, thirteen new weapons, six new music tracks, new monsters, and a new stage, which they’ve called their biggest yet. It comes out soon, on December 15.</span>

Spořič paměti má ušetřit až 40 % paměti a to tím, že bude uspávat neaktivní záložky. Tedy dělá to stejné jako například rozšíření Auto Tab Discard (pro Chrome, pro Firefox). Uspáním záložky přijdete o aktuální stav, čemuž půjde u vybraných stránek zabránit nastavením Always keep these sites active.</span>

Sadly this offering does not include Riot&#x27;s paid games, like the League spin-off RPG Ruined King. Read on for more details on what Riot are bringing to Game Pass.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission have moved to block Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. After months of review, during which Microsoft argued that the merger was fine because Activision Blizzard&#x27;s games aren&#x27;t that great really, the FTC have filed a complaint which argues that the acquisition &quot;would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.&quot;

                              <span>Rockstar have teased a new story update coming to GTA Online next week, which pits players against a ramshackle bunch of rival drug dealers. The Los Santos Drug Wars kick off on December 13th with the first part of the update. The short post on Rockstar’s Newswire blog isn&#x27;t exactly awash with details at the moment, but it does give an idea about the kind of dodgy characters and shenanigans you’ll get to encounter, including an angry looking luchador and the return of GTA 5’s Nervous Ron.

                              <span>There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new &quot;Stealth Strategy&quot; label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

                              <span>The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

                              <span>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year. Alas, I couldn&#x27;t vote for its rightful spot in the RPS Advent calendar because it&#x27;s only on Nintendo Switch, and would out me as somehow who quite enjoys the way anime south Londoners replace rude words with &quot;sparking&quot; or &quot;snuffing&quot;. Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I&#x27;ve been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game&#x27;s story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I&#x27;m ecstatic. In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s what makes the experience so special.

                              <span>Since release last Friday, The Callisto Protocol devs at Striking Distance Studio have been, I can only imagine, catastrophically hard at work on the PC build. The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It&#x27;s hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I&#x27;m out of town right now, so I haven&#x27;t been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

                              <span>A gameplay stream for Square Enix’s fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been dated for December 9th, but PlayStation Japan have tweeted an image that suggested a demo announcement will feature as part of that. Although the tweet’s been deleted since, user Renka_schedule was able to take a screengrab. You’ll be able to tune in to the Game Awards-adjacent Forspoken stream at 6pm GMT/7pm CET/10am PT, and presumably find out more about the demo during it.

                              <span>We’re all bracing ourselves for the imminent arrival of Storm Geoff at The Game Awards, but it seems as though some potential announcements are slipping between the various embargoes of the games industry a wee bit early. One of those could be the release date for Street Fighter 6, which appears to have crept onto the PlayStation Store ahead of any imminent reveal Capcom might have planned. Twitterer SurpriseBurn spotted a June 2nd, 2023 release date among pre-order listings for various editions of the latest in the long-running fighting game series.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission is looking to block Microsoft’s pending $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
According to a press release, the Commission, whose purpose is to protect consumers by promoting fair market competition, voted 3-1 to file a lawsuit to prevent the deal&#x27;s closure. Thus, a federal judge will weigh in and make a decision. Among other reasons, the FTC cites Microsoft’s record of using previous acquisitions to “suppress competition from rival consoles&quot; and points to the publisher&#x27;s purchase of ZeniMax in 2020 as an example, stating: 
“Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda&#x27;s titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival c…</span>

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It&#x27;s worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.</span>

We loved slaying Hell&#x27;s fiercest demons with the backdrop of crunchy guitar riffs, double-kick-pedal drum beats, and soaring vocals from some of metal&#x27;s most prolific artists. Today, developer The Outsiders and publisher Funcom have announced a wave of news, including a sales milestone, a new free title update, and the launch of the game on last-generation consoles.
Starting today, Metal: Hellsinger is available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was originally announced for these platforms at its initial reveal in 2020, but the last-gen versions were eventually canceled. Now, owners of last-gen consoles have access to this demon-slashing and beast-blasting adventure.

                              <span>A man arrested by Swedish police in 2021 has been charged with crimes relating to pirate IPTV service, Smart IPTV. The indictment, which contains a seizure order worth $1.2 million, reveals the man was logged into email accounts and crypto wallets during a police raid. An earlier case, involving IPTV, an uncooperative defendant, and a crypto hardware wallet, delivered quite a surprise at the 11th hour.

He’d been building and making as part of his job long before that though. “I used to be a police […]

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one on that list that runs on cheap, widely available AM4 motherboards with better value DDR4 RAM. That&#x27;s probably why the 5800X3D is reportedly AMD&#x27;s most popular CPU by sales - and it&#x27;s also why this deal is coming to the fore. Right now, you can pick up this fast AF CPU for $300 thanks to an Ebay code (JOLLY15), a hefty reduction from its launch price of $450.

Certain foods now grant you Eitr, which is Norse for snake poison, but never mind that because it lets you wield staves and develop skills in Elemental and Blood magic.
Also chickens! You can raise chickens now! They&#x27;ll give you eggs, which give you more chickens. There&#x27;s the real magic.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I&#x27;d make in almost every situation, as you&#x27;ll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you&#x27;ll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus&#x27;s 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

Chumps who want to fight alongside their summonable Spirit Ashes have to go to their own special colosseum, for nerds.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to its wildly popular series, Shovel Knight. But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/7/2022: Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the mobile battle royale title Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. 
Last month, Naka and former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki were arrested on suspicion of buying shares in developer Aiming after learning in advance about the team’s announcement of its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact (see the full original story below). Japanese outlet Asashi (thanks Video Games Chronicle) now reports that Naka and Sazaki are believed to have tried a similar scheme for the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.
Ashai notes that in February 2021, developer Ateam and Square Enix announced a partnership to develop the mobile battle royale title. Naka and Sazaki…</span>

Xbox head Phil Spencer has repeatedly promised that the juggernaut franchise will still appear on its main rival’s platforms, but that hasn’t stopped Sony from touting the loss of the series as anti-competitive to stop the deal from going through. After saying he had no problem keeping Call of Duty on Sony hardware for the long term, Spencer has now extended and formalized that promise to Nintendo and Valve. 
Last night, Spencer announced on Twitter that Microsoft has entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty back to Nintendo. In a follow-up tweet, Spencer states the series will remain on Steam …</span>

This is the first attempt to have so-called cyberlockers blocked in France but if successful, could undermine operations at dozens of other sites.

                              <span>Dragon Quest Treasures is a prequel to Dragon Quest 11. It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
