                              <span>Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going &#x27;cheap&#x27; on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you&#x27;ll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you&#x27;re forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

Pac-Man Museum+ is out on the Nintendo Switch this week. It&#x27;s a compilation of 14 titles from Pac-Man&#x27;s 40-year history.
To help build up some excitement, Bandai Namco has released a lovely new launch trailer - inspired by this collection. It&#x27;s also got plenty of Pac-Man-themed music throughout it, and at the end of the trailer, you can also see there&#x27;s an in-game launch bonus - available for a limited time.

                              <span>New game when?
Although Masahiro Sakurai is now done with Smash Bros. Ultimate, it seems like he may not be slowing down any time soon.
In a bit of an update on social media, the director of Nintendo&#x27;s all-star Smash Bros. series revealed how he recently had an online meeting with his former employer, HAL Laboratory. He had no need to necessarily make this public, but he has, which has already led to some speculation online.

                              <span>What questions have you got for the blue blur?
It&#x27;s a busy year for Sonic the Hedgehog, but somehow the blue blur still has time to take questions from his loyal fanbase. In fact, between 25th May and 2nd June, Sega Japan will be taking questions on his behalf (via social media) - allowing fans to ask the VTuber version of him anything they want for a special &#x27;Sonic Speed Q&amp;A&#x27;, taking place on 24th June on YouTube.
To ask a question, there is a bit of a catch - you&#x27;ll need to tweet while using the hashtag #音速一問一答. You don&#x27;t even need to follow the Sonic Official JP Twitter account and you can alternatively submit a question via the official Sonic Channel website. Keep in mind, that Sonic will be responding to these questions in Japanese, he&#x27;ll likely only respond to questions about himself, and most of his responses will likely be brief.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time for a vibe check
Over the years, Tarsier Studios has become one of those predictably unpredictable game makers that I&#x27;m always eager to check in on. The Malmö, Sweden-based studio has been quiet since wrapping up Little Nightmares II for Bandai Namco (which may or may not continue the series elsewhere, given all of its success), but we&#x27;re expecting new IPs.
This week on Twitter, Tarsier Studios shared a new teaser video with a coy message: &quot;We&#x27;ve been busy.&quot; Presumably, it&#x27;s a vibe check for the next big game idea.

While I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to classify the blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-&#x27;em clips, the visual concepts are dark and intriguing in a very Tarsier way. I&#x27;m sticking with the &quot;Horror&quot; tag for this article, and we&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>The strongest (and priciest) woman in the world
Deluxe merch-maker Prime 1 Studio is back again, bringing with it the latest release in their stunning range of premium &quot;Masterline&quot; character statues. Following on from 2021&#x27;s attractive diorama of Devil May Cry&#x27;s Dante, this new statue immortalizes one of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time, Street Fighter&#x27;s Chun-Li.
Standing at 1/4 scale (roughly 30 inches in height, including base), this gorgeous statue depicts The Strongest Woman in the World as she appears in Street Fighter V, bedecked in her classic Street Fighter II costume and daubed in its alternate pink coloring. The highly dynamic posing sees Chunners flowing with powerful energy, just a frame away from unleashing her devastating Critical Art attack.

Clearly, the fight has raged for quite some time, as our hero stands atop the debris of a decimated &quot;Bustling Side Street&quot; stage. The K.O. is most assuredly close. This Limited Edition also comes packaged with an alternate head, allowing fans to pose the Interpol agent in full focused combat mode, or coyly winking at the hapless opponent about to get sent into the stratosphere.
Now, the damage. The Premium Masterline Street Fighter V Chun-Li Pink Costume Limited Edition statue (phew) is no slouch on the wallet, retailing for a princely $1,099 USD (not including shipping). Truly limited, the statue has a meager format size of only 150, so she will be quite rare, even by premium statue standards. If you are a die-hard fan of the battlin&#x27; babe, then you can place your pre-order over on the official Prime 1 Studio store right now. Payment options are available, with Chunners expected to ship in late-2022/early 2023.
Yatta!

                              <span>It&#x27;s shaping up to be a great weekend for people who like getting lost in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars Celebration kicks off tomorrow in Anaheim, Calif, and the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi hit Disney&#x27;s streaming service a day later. Obi-Wan will also join the fight in Fortnite tomorrow night. And we should really start celebrating Star Wars right now, as today is the anniversary of A New Hope&#x27;s theatrical release.
If past Star Wars Celebrations are any example to follow, we&#x27;ll see plenty of collectibles announcements over the weekend. Some toy manufacturers are getting out in front of the potential bombardment of news. Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll see more in the days to come.
This line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith. We&#x27;re also getting a menacing sculpt of Darth Vader, who looks exactly like you would expect. The only new character is Reva, the Third Sister, looking ready to ignite her lightsaber. A deluxe version of Obi-Wan riding an Eopie is also on the way. All of these figures are expected to hit retailers in October. You can see them below:</span>

Bloober Team almost ended up tackling a very different horror franchise than Blair Witch. In a new interview, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno says the studio was offered the chance to take on several horror IPs including Saw, but passed on them for Blair Witch.
Speaking to IGN during the Digital Dragons games conference in Poland, Babieno described how the Blair Witch deal came to be. Bloober was in talks with multiple major movie studios, but passed on offers. Then came Lionsgate.
Lionsgate expressed admiration for Layers of Fear and Observer. The studio offered a list of horror IPs and, according to Babieno, offered Bloober its choice of one.
&quot;We could [have chosen] Saw, which is more popular than Blair Witch, but we decided to take Blair Witch because the universe has many opportunities to build something new,&quot; said Babieno. &quot;That was the reason why we chose this project.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RhaDPDf-xsM
He goes on to say that being offered these licenses wasn&#x27;t a one-off, and the studio has received more offers since Blair Witch. Bloober Team turned them down though, due to other projects in the pipeline.
&quot;Unfortunately, for almost one year, we have [had to say] &#x27;pass&#x27; to almost everything, because we don&#x27;t have capacity to do any more titles at one time,&quot; said Babieno.
Time to play a game
It&#x27;s an interesting game of what-if to play, imagining Bloober&#x27;s version of a Saw video game. The team went on to tackle Blair Witch instead though, and has seemingly kept busy since.
Currently, Bloober is working with Konami, though the product of that partnership hasn&#x27;t been announced. That hasn&#x27;t stopped the studio from being the subject of Silent Hill speculation, though.
The team is also working on another project with Take-Two publishing arm Private Division, and another that Babieno teases is in pre-production.

I generally approach matters of shooting digital Nazis in the face with avid gusto. However, fate conspired to delay my spree through Sniper Elite 5. A storm ripped through my neighborhood and thoroughly savaged the power grid. The electricity is still down, and I’m writing from a hidden bunker in a remote location. Be thankful, Fritz. You’ve been spared a few more days to tighten your helmet strap.
In the meantime, I can give you the rundown of what I have played in the dim light of my underground lair. I doubt any of it will be very surprising.

Anyone who&#x27;s ever had a beloved old gaming console die on them knows the heartbreak that comes along with it. A trusty little device that has gotten you through long nights and tough times is suddenly no more, and having to let go of a console that has a lot of memories attached to it can definitely sting. While most of us are likely to take our dead device to an e-waste center and move onto the next one, some gamers out there seem to be a bit more sentimental — and technically skilled in dismantling old hardware.
In a post on the r/gaming Subreddit, user Wolve5000 showed off their memorialized Nintendo DS Lite, and it has to be one of the most beautiful ways I&#x27;ve ever seen someone recycle an old console. Essentially they dismantled the …</span>

Electronic Arts has finally launched its long-awaited Custom Pronoun update for its popular sandbox lifestyle simulator The Sims 4. The new update, available now on PC and console platforms, offers a selection of pronouns that players can now afford their community of in-game Sims.
When creating a new Sim, players can now select a new option labeled &quot;Hello, my name and pronouns are…&quot; in order to name their character and their respective pronouns. Players can currently choose from &quot;He/Him,&quot; &quot;She/Her,&quot; &quot;They/Them,&quot; or &quot;Custom,&quot; which allows full control over Subjective, Objective, Possessive Dependent, Possessive Independent, and Reflexive forms of the character&#x27;s pronouns.

Sony is trying to get PlayStation fans in the spending mood again with its annual PlayStation Days of Play sale. The promo will run for two weeks — it&#x27;s here through Wednesday, June 8 — and features hundreds of PS4 and PS5 game deals on the PlayStation Store, as well as discounted DualSense controllers, if you need to stock up.
Considering I just bought a Starlight Blue controller a few weeks ago, I&#x27;m a little bummed! But that&#x27;s how it goes. If you&#x27;re looking to pick up a secondary PS5 gamepad, the original White, Cosmic Red, Galactic Purple, Midnight Black, Nova Pink, and Starlight Blue controllers are down to $59 on Amazon right now. Normally, they&#x27;re $70-$75 a pop.

                              <span>Horsepower coming to consoles
It&#x27;s taken almost five long years, but indie outfit Mane6 has announced that its equestrian hoof-&#x27;em-up is kickin&#x27; the dirt, snortin&#x27; steam, and getting ready to let rip on console platforms — Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds will finally come galloping onto PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms this fall.
Originally released for Steam Early Access way back in 2018, before receiving its full PC release in the spring of 2020, Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds is a hyper-stylized 2D fighter that sees some very silly mares duking it out in some hard hoofin&#x27; one-on-one action. From crazy-eyed alpacas and magical unicorns, to yee-hawing ponies and even a grumpy lil&#x27; goat, TFH combines cartoon quality art and animation with solid, old-school mechanics for a unique fighting game experience.

Originally conceived as a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan game, developer Mane6 quickly readjusted its design plans when Hasbro lawyers came a&#x27;callin. This proved to be the best thing that could happen for the project, however, and with fresh designs from Friendship is Magic creator Lauren Faust at hand, the Mane6 team embarked on its own original scrapper. A true passion project, Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds has seen more intensive and passionate developer support than many fighters 50 times its size and popularity.
The console edition of Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds will launch for $19.99. A Deluxe Edition, available for $39.99, includes a season pass for four new upcoming characters, as well as new stages and other cosmetics. You can check out all of the details by moseying on over to the Maximum Games Store.

                              <span>I want to try it on the next run
A new Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail is coming at &#x27;ya compliments of YouTuber Bigotilyou, who uncovered yet another thing I haven&#x27;t seen before.
The discovery deals with the final memory: a questline in Zelda that involves Link running around Hyrule to learn more about the past. As the below video on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail points out, there are actually two ways the final memory can play out:
One involves Link finding the memory as normal (this is the path most players will take).
The other includes a subtle extra bit of footage, provided that players actually take a photo of the picture on the wall in Impa&#x27;s abode.
The short video showcases all of the differences, starting with the &quot;alternate&quot; cut, then showing the way 99% of the playerbase likely saw it: followed by a supercut of both endings in one, with the former lasting a tad longer in length.
Like many Zelda: Breath of the Wild discoveries, a lot of people are probably like &quot;so, what?&quot; But the fact that so many of these sorts of things exist is a testament to its enduring legacy. Folks are still uncovering little tricks of the trade, and in an era where nearly everything is spoiled online in a week and everything is forgotten quickly, that&#x27;s a feat.
While some are tired of the Breath of the Wild discourse, for once, I&#x27;m glad that a game can live on beyond the initial zeitgeist explosion.

                              <span>The developer cites the impact of the war in Ukraine
Replaced made quite an impact last year during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference. Originally, developer Sad Cat Studios was aiming for a 2022 launch. But today, the studio announced Replaced has been delayed to 2023.
Sad Cat Studios is based out of Belarus, with a team of developers from Belarus and Ukraine. In today&#x27;s statement, the team cites the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying it has heavily impacted the development of Replaced, as most of the team resides in neighboring regions.
&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families,&quot; reads today&#x27;s statement. &quot;As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced.&quot;
Due to this, the publisher Coatsink, Thunderful, and developer all decided to move the release window to 2023. The team is continuing to work on Replaced, but says it is prioritizing the physical and mental health of its developers by not forcing the original deadline.

Enter the void
Replaced does look pretty rad, with some incredible pixel art and style to it. But the decision to take a little more time for the studios&#x27; well-being is a good one, and a little extra time is a pittance compared to making sure the team at Sad Cat Studios is doing okay.
The war in Ukraine has had an effect on many of the game studios in the region. In response to the situation, many publishers and developers called for aid, to help those affected by the invasion. Recently, Epic and Microsoft teamed up to donate Fortnite proceeds towards various charities, ultimately raising $144 million in support.
Other companies have also responded by removing their games from sale. CD Projekt halted sales in Russia and Belarus, and Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from several of its sports games.

Temtem is out in September, according to publisher Humble Games, and it&#x27;ll arrive on the PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms. A collector&#x27;s edition has also been announced, and will feature a statue of the three starters, a card set, pins, patches, and a collector&#x27;s box.
If you&#x27;ve never played or heard of it before Jordan has a great writeup here, but suffice to say it&#x27;s essentially a different take on the Pokemon formula. You play the role of a tamer [trainer], and attempt to catch creatures and battle them. The studio calls it a &quot;massive multiplayer creature-collection adventure.&quot;

Billed as the &quot;1.0&quot; edition following a lengthy early access period, the story campaign involves &quot;six vivid islands,&quot; with a narrative involving the &quot;evil Clan Belsoto.&quot; Of course, there&#x27;s chilling involved too, with activities like fishing and hanging around the open world. Unlike Pokemon, the team has embraced online play, and allows you to &quot;see other tamers around&quot; on the map and fight in co-op form. Player housing is in too, as well as outfit customization and competitive elements (which involves a round of bans and picks until you square off in a 5v5 format).
New stuff that&#x27;s coming to Temtem 1.0 includes seasonal updates and a battle pass system, with free and premium tracks. There&#x27;s also a &quot;final endgame island,&quot; which has new vendors, places to explore, and more battle opportunities. Quests will be updated &quot;weekly and regularly.&quot;
With the level of success this game has reached before 1.0, it stands to reason that it&#x27;ll be supported for some time after Temtem is out in September.

As we approach the first anniversary of gorgeous fighter Guilty Gear Strive, (yes, already), developer Arc System Works has announced that it will be dropping a major update at the start of next month, bringing with it a full roster rebalance, gameplay and mechanic tweaks, and a further optimized control system.
While no further details were announced in relation to this update, it appears much more than your common-or-garden everyday batch of buffs and nerfs. It appears that the patch will actually reapproach the core elements of Guilty Gear Strive&#x27;s combat, which is perhaps an effort to quell some of the complaints that have come around (mainly from the ultra-hardcore community) regarding Strive&#x27;s heavy-hitting, streamlined gameplay — a design decision that…</span>

                              <span>They&#x27;re out on May 31 with the new update
Developer miHoYo just put out a new Genshin Impact Yelan trailer, which shows off the core new five-star character that&#x27;s set to debut in update 2.7.
As usual, it looks like the studio has knocked it out of the park, as Yelan is essentially coming out of nowhere and making an...impact. As a five-star hydro archer, she&#x27;ll join Kuki Shinobu (a four-star electro support) as the main gang of update 2.7. A &quot;drumalong rhythm game,&quot; a new Archon Quest taking place in the Chasm, and Xiao/Arataki Itto banner re-runs are on the menu come May 31, too.
What I love about Genshin is how much variety there is when it comes to the cast. Anything is possible, from criminal underlords to magical girls, to stalwart shonen types. And somehow, the team manages to craft characters with a heavy mix of personality and unique gameplay abilities — but when those characters are tied to gacha elements, making them as enticing as possible is part of the craft.
Get a load of Yelan below, and a full rundown of her moveset here.
Here&#x27;s the cinematic Genshin Impact Yelan character teaser to get some insight into their personality:

The successor to the Suikoden series is headed to a portable system. Today, Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios confirms that Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is coming to Nintendo Switch.
There had been questions about whether the RPG would make it onto Nintendo&#x27;s portable console. In a Kickstarter post, Rabbit &amp; Bear addresses it, saying the studio wanted to &quot;play it safe&quot; and investigate options before fully committing.
No firm date has been set, though Hundred Heroes is targeting a 2023 launch last we heard. It was already confirmed for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. And now, today&#x27;s post locks in a Nintendo Switch launch for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes as well.

                              <span>Capcom has them all in video form now
If you were looking for all of the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak weapon changes, you came to the right place! Capcom just finished its video series on the whole lot, which you can peruse below.
In short, Sunbreak is reworking how every weapon operates with extra Silkbind abilities. With the new abilities, Capcom has addressed some of the shortcomings of several weapons. Most of them seem to be focused on adding more maneuverability into the mix, and several are actually extremely low-key for an expansion — in a good way!
It looks like Capcom used some restraint for the Sunbreak weapon changes, particularly for the Light Bowgun, which debuted its changes today. One key ability is the Wyvern Counter, which is an &quot;urgent retreat that fires a shot with a massive recoil.&quot; Think of it like a blast dodge.
In a sense, each weapon will feel distinctly different with a higher skill ceiling, without sacrificing the original intent and mechanical foundation. Well that&#x27;s the goal, anyway! I&#x27;m sure pros will find all of the nuances, upgrades, and downgrades on day one.

Some tubular news for Xbox fighting game fans today, as publisher Autumn Games has announced that the charleston-tastic scrapper Skullgirls 2nd Encore is currently in development for Xbox platforms, with a tentative release date of late-2022. In addition, developer Hidden Variable released the very first gameplay footage of yer boy&#x27;s favorite Skullgirls character, the terrifying Black Dahlia!
As you can see from this alpha footage, The Medici Family&#x27;s sinister assassin is shaping up to be quite the unliving nightmare. Dahlia&#x27;s gameplay is built around her explosive (and literal) side-arm, which allows the exquisite maniac to control the playing field with a variety of differently equipped rounds. So, for example, Dahlia may choose to keep her prey at bay with explosive ro…</span>

                              <span>Also, there&#x27;s a new short
The Sonic 2 streaming date has come! If you didn&#x27;t catch the most successful (domestically) video game adaptation yet, you can now. As of this week, it&#x27;s currently on Paramount Plus (US) — and a trial period or a one-month subscription is likely less than buying it digitally elsewhere. It&#x27;s coming to Blu-ray and physical form on August 9.
Also, note that to celebrate the Sonic 2 streaming release, a new short called &quot;Sonic Drone Home&quot; is being teased (which you can peruse below) that comes with digital purchases (or is available on YouTube). While it does feature Ben Schwartz reprising his role as Sonic from the feature films, sadly, Idris Elba and Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey do not appear to return as Knuckles and Tails respectively. As far as the animation goes, hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Knuckles TV show.
Having finally caught Sonic 2 yesterday, like the first film, it was a pleasant surprise. While the live-action characters sometimes stop the narrative dead in its tracks, I appreciated the focus on Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and Jim Carrey is always a delight. I&#x27;m really curious who they&#x27;re going to cast for that post-credits tease character — and how they&#x27;re going to handle the edge!

A party of current and former Activision Blizzard employees have formed a new committee in order to combat sexism, inequality, and gender bias within the studio&#x27;s walls. The anti-discrimination committee currently consists of 12 members, and has drafted a list of demands for the attention of Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, diversity officer Kristen Hines, and chief human resources officer Julie Hodges.
As reported by The Washington Post, the four-page document demands include private lactation support, 12 weeks of paid parental leave, and the implementation of independent investigations for employee complaints and incidents. The latter of these is likely a response to Activision&#x27;s recent decision to create its own &quot;Workplace Responsibility Commit…</span>

Sharing the summary for update 0.6.1 on Steam, Vampire Survivors developer poncle said to expect &quot;less content than usual&quot; — but players have already unearthed significant content, including a merchant, new playable characters, and a way to keep the game fresh once &quot;there&#x27;s nothing left to unlock.&quot; That said, the creator doesn&#x27;t want to pressure players, noting: &quot;please don&#x27;t feel like you have to grind for these new bonuses.&quot;

It&#x27;s an incredibly polished and adorable game with fun characters and some awesome representation. All eyes are on Game Grumps to see what they&#x27;ll do after the success of their debut, and now they&#x27;ve finally announced their next project: a narrative-driven, psychological horror game called Homebody.
Homebody is developed by the team at Game Grumps, and will be published by Rogue Games. The game was inspired by classic slasher films from the 1980s, and will center on a woman named Emily as…</span>

The new season of Destiny 2 goes live today, and a rework of the Solar subclass arrives alongside it. Destiny 2 Season of the Haunted adds new abilities to each class&#x27; Solar capabilities, from more hammer-time to more anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5Pqu5n-zao8
A new video published this morning goes into detail about what&#x27;s in store for each Solar subclass. Past reworks have shaken up subclasses quite a bit, but these seem focused on several new abilities, adding some more &quot;oomph&quot; to the moveset. The Bungie developers jokingly refer to this as &quot;Operation Caliente,&quot; meant to spice up abilities that have been stagnant.

The Switch has been with us for over five years, and I suspect many reading these pages have built sizeable game collections in that time. From full price retail games and highly-rated downloadable titles down to speculative, bargain-priced sales pick-ups and free-to-play offerings, there are a lot of Switch games in my collection chasing my attention; if they were sentient, some would probably settle for actually being installed.

With the death of Adobe Flash Player on 1st January 2021, many creators have gone to great lengths to preserve the projects they created over the years. If you were around at the peak of this era, then the name Newgrounds will be familiar to you, and I&#x27;m sure everyone has something they spent hours upon hours of mouse clicking and on.
One game that released on the site — and is still available there — is IndestructoTank!, an arcade-style game that lets you drive an indestructible tank. In this vehicle, you&#x27;re safe from bombs; in fact, you can bounce off of them into the air and then maintain uptime by bouncing off of helicopters, planes, and other airborne modes of transport! Bouncing in the air gets you experience points, and once you&#x27;ve reached enough to level up, when you land all four wheels on the ground, you can upgrade your impenetrable tank and add more enemies for more hectic hopping!

                              <span>Surprise!
In a surprise announcement, SNK has announced the next game in its Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection series, Biomotor Unitron. Released on the handheld back in 1999, this was the very first RPG for the system.
The game mixes sci-fi elements with dungeon crawling. You control a robot through these dungeons — which are semi-random a selected from a variety of pre-programmed layouts — and level up the character controlling the Unitron robot. As your level increases, so does your ability to control the Unitron. The game launched in Japan and North America, but never saw a European release.

We still don&#x27;t have a concrete release date for upcoming wholesome game, Potion Permit, but now that you can pre-order the physical version of the game, we&#x27;re tempted to say that it&#x27;ll be sooner rather than later.
In Potion Permit, you&#x27;ll play the role of a small-town chemist whose job it is to heal, treat, and win over the locals, who are naturally suspicious of this newfangled alchemy. You can diagnose symptoms, find cures, collect materials, and even fight monsters while you&#x27;re foraging for ingredients — so it sounds right up your alley if you&#x27;re a Stardew Valley fan.

No Man&#x27;s Sky for Switch was confirmed back in Nintendo&#x27;s February Direct. Scheduled for a summer release, we&#x27;ve not had many updates on this hybrid version — which is confirmed to be coming with all 20 previous updates, including the two newest ones — since its announcement. But in a press release for today&#x27;s Leviathan expedition, developer Hello Games has confirmed it is duly working on that Switch port.
In the press release, the company has talked about what to expect in its newest update today, but also touched on that highly-anticipated Switch version:

The fantastic OlliOlli World is getting its first major story expansion with Void Riders on June 15th, bringing new levels and gear to the game for the price of £7.99.
Initially launched on February 8th, OlliOlli World is a spiritual successor to Roll7&#x27;s OlliOlli series, combining incredibly tight skateboarding mechanics with a wacky, Adventure Time inspired world with tonnes of customisable gear for your chosen character. We gave the game a hefty 9/10 in our review.

You might not have heard of Jim&#x27;ll Paint It — but you&#x27;ve probably seen his work. His real name is James Murray, and he&#x27;s an artist from Bristol whose chosen medium is... MS Paint. Yeah, the one from your school&#x27;s creaky old Windows computer that you used to draw terrible squares with.
If you think to yourself, &quot;there&#x27;s no way that someone can make good art with MS Paint,&quot; you&#x27;d largely be right — but Jim&#x27;ll Paint It has built an entire business off of taking requests, the more specific the better, for him to draw in Paint. His latest request is an intriguing mash-up between seminal 3D Zelda game, Ocarina of Time, and cosy British archaeology show, Time Team. Ocarina of Time Team. Get it?

Previously, Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios — helmed by Suikoden creator Yoshitaka Murayama — had said that its upcoming RPG will be coming to &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s next-generation console&quot;. But today, in a Kickstarter update for the game, the developer has announced that the game will indeed be coming to the current generation! This is on top of the already confirmed console releases, and maybe whatever comes after the Switch!

Oh boy, new discoveries in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild just keep coming. This time, however, rather than a player-created glitch or trick, a YouTuber has discovered a lovely little detail from Nintendo itself nestled in a cutscene towards the end of the game (spoilers, we guess?).
During Link&#x27;s adventure in Hyrule, he visits various areas of the land and uncovers select memories of his time during the Great Calamity, thus setting himself up for the final confrontation with Calamity Ganon. Once Link has acquired the optional memories, Impa will point the way to the final memory, located at Ash Swamp just south of Kakariko Bridge.

                              <span>A third scare.
The third entry in Nippon Ichi&#x27;s Yomawari series is coming West! NIS America has today announced that Yomawari: Lost in the Dark (called Yomawari 3 in Japan) will be launching on Switch later this year! This comes over three years since the first two games came to the console in the Yomawari: The Long Night Collection package.
We know very little about the upcoming atmospheric horror game, but fans will know not to let the soft music or chibi-style visuals fool them.

Mane6&#x27;s popular bovine beat &#x27;em up Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds is finally coming to consoles! Published by Modus Games, this farmyard fighter sees a cast of cuddly hooved fighters duke it out with one another in a range of settings — all animal appropriate, of course. This announcement comes months after the game was rated for Switch by the ESRB.
The cast of adorable characters have all been designed by the producer and developer for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Lauren Faust, who was also the creator, director, and developer for DC superhero short series Super Best Friends Forever, and all of these four-legged friends come with some unusual and hilarious move sets.

Dear Villagers and Alkemi have shuffled their decks and laid their cards out on the table in the newest trailer for their upcoming deck-building narrative game, Foretales.
With art inspired by classic 2D Disney cartoons, Foretales is a deckbuilder that looks to put the story at the top of the deck. Developer Alkemi says the &quot;decksploration&quot; mechanic sees every interaction and story beat play out through the cards. Players will be able to deal out their own adventure — sometimes you might be able to get past foes without fighting or even recruit someone to your party with a bottle of ale. The choice is in the hands of the player, and your choices will often lead to consequences.

Publisher RedDeerGames has announced that Balloon Flight will be drifting its way onto the Switch this week, launching on May 27th. The game&#x27;s title, of course, sounds like Balloon Fight, but in terms of gameplay, it looks quite different, indeed.
The game utilises a first-person perspective and sees you both deploy and burst balloons via a specialised weapon. The general premise is to use the balloons (presumably filled with helium) to lift up a platform and effectively fly it through targets and reach your destination.

We&#x27;ve featured the extraordinary TheDominoKing before here at Nintendo Life, but their latest creation is truly stunning. This time, the domino enthusiast has created a stunning Mario &amp; Luigi tribute that&#x27;s utterly hypnotic to watch take shape.
This three-part masterpiece starts with a chain of dominos crashing into a huge domino warp pipe, which collapses into the second line of blocks. These then form a pixel art Super Mario Bros.-style piece, which then links up to the final gorgeous piece with Mario and Luigi high-fiving — just like this art from Super Mario Maker 2.

In a unique premise for the genre, your goal as P-Chan is to help internet star Ame get 1 million subscribers in just 31 days — not even we&#x27;ve managed that! But it&#x27;s not all sweet and saccharine as you have to balance fighting off internet trolls and critics while also helping Ame have fun outside of her internet idol persona. This sounds a little too realistic.

                              <span>A surprise patch has dropped for the PC version of the action RPG that many missed out on last year, Ys IX: Monstrum Nox, which makes now would be a perfect time to get acquainted with the series.
While working on the upcoming localization of Trails From Zero (another Falcom game you should keep your eyes on), PH3 developer Peter &quot;Durante&quot; Thoman discovered how to increase CPU performance in that game. After finding promising results in Trails From Zero, he brought the technique over to Ys IX. Lo and behold, there was an impressive frame rate boost with the same implementation, with a 25% increase in parts of the game where the CPU can bottleneck performance. The update proved stable enough in testing to push it live for everyone playing the Steam version.
Here are the full patch notes fro…</span>

Disney and Lucasfilm always bring a few surprises to Celebration, and I have a feeling we&#x27;ll see a good number of them this year. The show runs until Sunday and should be packed with announcements. Here&#x27;s what I expect to see, and how you can tune in to see the reveals as they happen:

Publisher Coastink, parent company Thunderful, and developer Sad Cat Studios’ statement on Twitter reads (in its entirety) as follows:


The Russia-Ukraine war continues to be a devastating conflict affecting the lives of millions. Game studios have been showing support for Ukraine with some developers creating projects that are a &quot;clear middle finger&quot; to the invasion.</span>

                              <span>Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. 


Like the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: 
“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” 
For all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. 
Kim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:
“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”


Hopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.</span>

                              <span>After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.
If the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic&#x27;s launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. 


Them’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. 
The console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. 
Them’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.</span>

                              <span>End Global 7, a co-op company composed of prominent development studios like DC Universe Online dev Daybreak Game Company, revealed last November that it had a new Marvel MMORPG in early development. Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. 
This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. 
“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”
EG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” 
It sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future. For more, read about the graphics upgrade and massive expansion coming to DC Universe Online in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Hello Games just released the Outlaws update for No Man’s Sky back in April alongside news that its next project won’t be a sequel to the sci-fi title, and now, the studio has revealed that it’s launching another expedition…today!
Dubbed “Leviathan,” this expedition is the result of a community in-joke that No Man’s Sky is missing space whales because space whales is exactly what Leviathan brings to the game. However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. 


“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.
“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”

The story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet.

Diablo Immortal is just around the corner. After its big release date announcement last month, we released an installment of New Gameplay Today all about the game, how it plays on both mobile devices and PC, and more. Today, we&#x27;re back with even more new Diablo Immortal footage and another developer interview. This time, we&#x27;ve got principal game designer Joe Grubb and senior game designer Scott Burgess joining your host John Carson to talk about the lore implications of Diablo Immortal, some of the big bads, returning characters, class changes, and even the game&#x27;s audio design. 


Diablo Immortal hits Android and iOS devices, as well as PC, on June 2 so hopefully, if you&#x27;re excited about the first-ever Diablo game made from-the-ground-up for mobile, this tides you over until then.
For more about Diablo Immortal, be sure to head to the official Game Informer Diablo Immortal hub, which contains first looks at the game, news stories, and more. For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Fueled Up, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, MultiVersus, Bear And Breakfast, and more.</span>

                              <span>Temtem is a popular online multiplayer monster-catching game that’s a lot like Pokémon and it’s been in early access for years. However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. 


That includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. 
“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”
However, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here. For more, read about Temtem’s PS5 arrival back in December of 2020, and then check out this installment of New Gameplay Today all about Temtem.

Here&#x27;s a handful of films you may want to check out, and where to find them on a given streaming service if they are available. If a movie below isn&#x27;t available to view as part of a subscription, such as Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Disney+, etc., it&#x27;s most likely available to rent or buy digitally from companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Vudu, and more. 
The following list was created on May 5, 2022, and the availability of these movies may have changed.

What if there was a way to stop the aging process and only your family knew the secret? How far would you go to protect it? And at what cost? The Centennial Case isn’t your typical murder-mystery adventure game. It goes out of its way to be different, whether it’s swapping you to various murders over the course of 100 years or using live-action footage to make you feel like you’re participating in a movie. The latter evokes a nostalgic feeling of the FMV games of yore, but the advanced tech and heavy focus on deduction create an experience …</span>

What wasn&#x27;t mentioned, is that French law prohibits streaming services from showing recent movies, which arguably keeps piracy relevant at the same time.

The game&#x27;s graphics riff on the ‘HD-2D’ style of RPG that Square Enix introduced with Octopath Traveler. Have a watch of the trailer below.

I mean, Matt Cox (RPS in peace) said it was the best game at E3 2019 when it was due out in early 2020. Then it got delayed to early 2021. And now the game&#x27;s first season has - *double checks* - finally arrived.
So, Ollie, Liam, and I strapped on our skates and jumped into a few games to see how it&#x27;s getting on. Ollie had some experience with the game before, while Liam and I went in totally blind. We all emerged from our play sesh glowing with praise albeit with a tinge of worry. Would it get any traction, or quickly succumb to the cheery sports game curse?

                              <span>Karl Fairburne, the titular Sniper Elite, is a pro at pinging baddies in the distance. The master of shooting Nazis in the balls across hundreds of metres. It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

Homebody will channel the slasher film aesthetic of the 1980s, a stark tonal shift from the hand-drawn cheesecake colourfulness of Game Grumps and Rogue Games&#x27; first collaboration, Dream Daddy. Some of the same team are back for this one though. Watch the eerie trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve seen a developer or publisher blow a bunch of money on a big, dumb videogame announcement, but then here comes Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

                              <span>Hardspace: Shipbreaker was one of our favourite games from 2020, and after several years in early access it has now reached 1.0. Today saw the release of the spaceship salvage sim&#x27;s third and final act, along with a full game re-balance and hundreds of bug fixes.

                              <span>Joining the scandalously overlooked Blast-Axis and the more recognised Overload in the pantheon of Descentants this week, it&#x27;s Zerograve. Is this a genre revival now? Three solid contenders (that I&#x27;m aware of) must surely bring us close.
It&#x27;s fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don&#x27;t want to start on a downer so let&#x27;s say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

                              <span>Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

That’s the basis of Polish author Jacek Piekara’s series of novels, now set to become third-person action adventure I, The Inquisitor, from developers The Dust. Somebody probably ought to consult the Archbishop of Canterbury for the PEGI rating, like. Watch the trailer below.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king&#x27;s abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano&#x27;s development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

Keighley made the comments in a Twitter Spaces cast over the weekend, probably to everyone&#x27;s great relief. Of course, he immediately followed up by explaining that the publishers with fewer games to show will be rolling their presentations into Keighley’s own Summer Game Fest, as well as first-party shows such as the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.

                              <span>Quality assurance testers working for Activision Blizzard at Raven Software have voted to unionise within the Communication Workers of America, the first notable such union at a US-based studio. Three members of the Game Workers Alliance (GWA) group voted against, while 19 voted in favour. The vote means legal recognition for the group at the Call Of Duty: Warzone developers, which first organised in January in response to layoffs at the end of last year.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

Every day, we&#x27;re learning something new about what we can — and crucially can&#x27;t — expect from the tiered PlayStation Plus revamp launching on June 13 in North America. Today, it&#x27;s a caveat about the subscription&#x27;s streamable PS3 games: namely, you won&#x27;t be able to access any of their DLC. This was an issue before with cloud-based games played via PlayStation Now, and it&#x27;ll still be present with PlayStation Plus Premium.
As pointed out by Video Games Chronicle, Sony confirmed this week that &quot;DLC and add-on content is not supported when streaming a title.&quot;
This shouldn&#x27;t be a huge surprise given the previous limitation with PlayStation Now, but offering DLC would&#x27;ve been a good chance for Sony to increase the…</span>

The pixel RPG genre has been enjoying a surge as of late, and Codename: Wandering Sword looks to keep the momentum going. This particular RPG has been getting around by word of mouth on social media, and for good reason: it looks pretty dang interesting.
Codename: Wandering Sword is a new game from Xiameng Studio. The developer describes it as a Wuxia-style pixel RPG, where the player takes on the role of a young man involved in a serious feud. After your life is saved, you embark on a grand journey in the Central Plains.
The pixel art jumps out at me right away, bringing up some Octopath Traveler vibes. The Steam page boasts quite a list of features, including multiple endings for the story, a huge open world, and NPCs with friendship to win…</span>

                              <span>Family Feud
Japanese indie dev nekogameteacher, (of Super Drink Bros. fame), is back on the scene with an equally nutty title with an equally silly premise. Currently in development for PC, Family Battle: Tag Arena promises multiplayer mayhem in a colorful anime world that hosts one too many superheroes.
You&#x27;ll have to bear with me, as details are understandably muddled, but it appears that Family Battle, true to its title, is the tale of two extended families of superpowered heroes, facing off to determine who is the one true &quot;Super Family.&quot; This war will play out in a series of two-on-two arena-based battles, with teams stepping into the role of their chosen family members — all of which carry their own unique skills, abilities, powers, and play styles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fZKNRlCIdGQ
With one player in the role of &quot;Attacker&quot; and a second player as &quot;Support,&quot; the two teams engage in fast-paced and chaotic 3D warfare, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks as well as their own respective powers to take the fight. While the attacking characters get down and dirty on the front line, it is up to the supporting player to disrupt the enemy from long-range — laying traps, clearing out hazards, or providing their partner with offensive and defensive buffs. With strong chemistry and quick communication, a team can use its strategy and synergy to bring the bragging rights back home.
Family Battle: Tag Arena is currently in development for PC (via Steam). It will enter an Early Access period from August 6, but you can check out the official store page right now. Do it for The Family.

As DICE keeps ramping up to the launch of Season 1, another Battlefield 2042 mode is taking a backseat. The studio confirms today that it&#x27;s shutting down future development on Battlefield 2042&#x27;s Hazard Zone mode.
The new mode, an Escape From Tarkov-like experience in the Battlefield setting, was one of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s major pillars going into launch. Today though, EA and DICE are saying that future development will cease on the mode.
&quot;All of us on the team had great ambition and high hopes for this new Battlefield experience throughout our development, but we’re the first to hold our hands up and acknowledge that it hasn’t found the right home in Battlefield 2042 and that we’ll benefit greatly from letting our focus and energy stay on the modes we see you en…</span>

Guerrilla Games&#x27; gorgeous sequel Horizon Forbidden West has successfully ventured back to the top of the UK Charts, reclaiming the number one spot three months on from its initial launch week success.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Aloy&#x27;s second escapade saw an incredible 94% week-on-week sales increase in the UK territory, driven by the launch of Sony&#x27;s first official PS5 hardware bundle. The new set, which retails in the UK for a princely £499.99, includes a standard, disc-based PS5 console, a DualSense controller, and a digital copy of the acclaimed adventure. A variant featuring a PS5 Digital is also available, priced at £409.99. Of course, like most PS5 units, the Horizon Forbidden West bundle is already in short supply, both in stores and online.

                              <span>Looking forward to a reboot of an iconic Call of Duty title
Fans of the Call of Duty series expect a new game every year, but there&#x27;s always plenty of hype when the new release dates start rolling around. That&#x27;s at least the case for me, maybe because I&#x27;m still a baby CoD fan, because I&#x27;m pumped to try out the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, especially now that it has a release date. They&#x27;re really building the suspense on this one — first the logo reveal last month, now the art reveal, and then some potential new announcements teased for the future.
The Call of Duty Twitter officially revealed the next franchise entry&#x27;s release date this morning: October 28, 2022. Along with that info, we also got a short video showing off the art for some of the game&#x27;s characters, which includes a return of Task Force 141, who were also principal characters in the original Modern Warfare 2. We also caught a glimpse of a mysterious numbered sequence that reads &quot;J-8-22&quot; at around the 44-second mark, which just might be an important date for fans to look forward to.

This title is actually a reboot sequel of the 2009 game with the exact same name, something that has caused a few fans (including myself) a bit of confusion this time around. Modern Warfare 2 is truly a beloved title in Call of Duty history, so it makes a lot of sense that Activision would want to bring it back for another go-around. We got some really iconic missions from that game, like &quot;Wolverines!&quot; and &quot;Cliffhanger,&quot; so here&#x27;s hoping we get to see some other really memorable adventures this time around, too.
I personally love a good sniper mission, but something I always look forward to in a good CoD campaign is those larger-than-life set pieces. Here&#x27;s hoping that Infinity Ward can deliver this time around, and revamp the series in a way we&#x27;ve needed in the past few years.

                              <span>&quot;Culturally, the company didn’t see a huge opportunity in online&quot;
Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has a book to sell, and we&#x27;re learning all sorts of fascinating info from his time at Nintendo as a result. This time, we&#x27;re learning about the Nintendo online play situation: specifically why the company took forever to actually implement it in earnest.
Speaking to the GeekWire podcast (via Nintendo Life), Reggie elucidated on what a lot of folks assumed over the years regarding Nintendo&#x27;s slow play with online, with some inside info. Noting that Nintendo has always been interested in &quot;doing things differently,&quot; he highlighted the strong historical push for couch co-op, going all the way up to the Wii era with Wii Sports (something else Reggie knows quite a bit about).

                              <span>Yakuza heroes (don&#x27;t) cameo in new DLC
You might have heard the hot scoop that Kazuma Kiryu is about to guest star in Rainbow Six Siege. Well, he isn&#x27;t, but his suit and haircut sure are. Ubisoft has announced that it is collaborating with Sega to bring character skins of the Yakuza hero — as well as his one-time love interest and ass-kicking partner, Kaoru Sayama — to its popular online squad shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9rnZeKj9SWM
The Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle, which launches on all platforms today, includes looks for Siege&#x27;s resident &quot;Team Japan,&quot; Hibana and Echo. In addition to the character skins, new weapon skins will kit Hibana out with a Police-themed rifle skin, while Echo gets a pearl-colored rifle skin emblazoned with the legendary Dragon of Dojima. Though these are, essentially, Siege characters in cosplay, it&#x27;s still pretty weird to see even a dollar store Kazuma carrying a gun. Later this season, a new Elite skin will see Echo transform into the wildly unpredictable Goro Majima, as teased in the above trailer.
This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege has ventured into &quot;guest skins&quot; territory. Back in 2020, Rainbow squad leader Ash got her Lara Croft on, while 2021 saw Zofia don the iconic S.T.A.R.S. garb of Resident Evil&#x27;s Jill Valentine. These crossover costumes are part of Rainbow Six Siege&#x27;s continued progression into a wider universe of lore — evolving from its nationalistic and stringently militant, roots into a more approachable, character-driven, alternate universe. Another example of this new direction lies in the icky, sci-fi sensibilities of 2021&#x27;s Rainbow Six Extraction, which saw the counter-terrorist team battle a literal alien invasion.
Rainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Extraction are available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle is available on all platforms today.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time for the annual &quot;where&#x27;s the sequel?&quot; chant
The Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 10th anniversary is underway, and Capcom is celebrating it with (!)...a website dedicated to the series. It&#x27;s one of the most Capcom things we&#x27;ll see all week!
Amid a historical breakdown of the several projects that the franchise has produced, we get a short message from the game&#x27;s legendary director Hideaki Itsuno (who is still at Capcom, and still wants to make a sequel):
&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma, first released in 2012, is celebrating its 10th anniversary! Thank you, Arisen, for taking up arms and braving through the impossible challenges laid ahead of you. We are forever grateful for your support throughout the years and hope you will join us in this momentous celebration of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma!&quot;

As a reminder, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma launched in 2012, and was eventually awarded an expansion-re-release of sorts with Dark Arisen. In 2015, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma Online was released exclusively in Japan, which didn&#x27;t help keep up the series&#x27; cachet worldwide. In 2020, an anime adaptation debuted on Netflix. We&#x27;re still waiting for a cold hard sequel or a true follow-up.
Hopefully, this Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 10th anniversary website is the start of that campaign. While the art is lovely, the site isn&#x27;t too much to look at currently. Out of the six &quot;historical bullet points,&quot; three of them are for ports of Dark Arisen on various platforms.
Still, sequel-begging aside, this series deserves to be celebrated in some fashion, and if this is all we&#x27;re getting, at least it&#x27;s something.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.
A PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. 


The DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. 
The controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  
To learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.</span>

A few weeks after the confirmation of its existence, Activision Blizzard announced the release date of the next Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, in a tweet accompanied by a video showing off character art from the game.
#ModernWarfare2 Ships October 28th 💀 pic.twitter.com/OsgOspGh1j
May 24, 2022
The tweet reads, “#ModernWarfare2 ships October 28.” Get it? Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.
For a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.

While we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has secured its release date along with a new cinematic trailer. 
Gollum’s video game solo outing launches September 1 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.


The game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. 
Gameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. 
We last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.</span>

Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate returns the game to the setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the Forgotten Realms, but as it says in the name, the set focuses on an important location in video games as well as tabletop adventures, Baldur&#x27;s Gate. Last week, we posted a rundown of the set and its mechanics, so check out that story to get the lowdown on the new and returning mechanics.
Wizards of the Coast has graciously allowed us to preview one of the cards coming with this set, and this creature may want all of the big-brain plays you can muster. Take a look at Intellect Devourer.

                              <span>When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur&#x27;s debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

                              <span>Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. 
The new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.


For comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. 
However, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet.

                              <span>Take-Two, the publisher behind household name franchises like Grand Theft Auto, XCOM, and NBA2K, has officially acquired mobile juggernaut Zynga in the second-biggest deal in games history after Microsoft&#x27;s eventual acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
According to PC Gamer, the proposals were approved last Thursday, and the acquisition totals a whopping $12.7 billion. Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company&#x27;s excitement about the deal, stating:
&quot;We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality.&quot;
Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, &quot;We are excited for Zynga&#x27;s next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga&#x27;s history.&quot;
Perhaps we&#x27;ll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox&#x27;s commitment to buying studios that are &quot;a good fit.&quot;

                              <span>Virtual reality hasn’t caught on as quickly as some predicted, but VR headsets have managed to amass an impressive collection of software in the last few years regardless. And given Sony&#x27;s recent PSVR2 announcements, this could be a big year for virtual reality. If you just bought a Meta Quest or haven’t fired yours up in a long time, there are several great experiences to be had. We highlight some of the best VR titles out now for the Quest, from high octane music games to spooky shooters. Here are 10 VR games you shouldn’t ignore, in no particular order.
Honorable Mentions: Half-Life: Alyx and Lone Echo
If you have a VR-ready gaming PC, you can connect it to a Quest via an Oculus Link Cable or over WiFi using Air Link. Doing so unlocks a number of PC-based VR games, most notably Half-Lif…</span>

                              <span>Gloomhaven is a dungeon-crawling board game that required a little muscle from the player, as its massive box weighs over 20 pounds. That heft is the conversation starter that helped Gloomhaven find the audience it rightfully deserves. It&#x27;s a great board game experience that was recently adapted into an equally as notable turn-based tactical RPG for PC. And now developer Flaming Fowl Studios and publisher Asmodee Digital have plans to release this digital version on consoles in 2023.
Asmodee is working with Saber Games and Embracer Group on this console port. No specific systems are known at this time, but Asmodee&#x27;s tweet announcing this project shows an image of an Xbox controller. You can see it below along with a teaser video for the console versions:

It’s said that even the best-laid plans often go awry, and that is fully evident in Mini Motorways. What starts as a pleasant city-planning simulation evolves into a frantic puzzle you must solve before time runs out. The stress of having your carefully planned city infrastructure crumble before your eyes is undeniable. However, it’s in that often-sudden transition from meditative to manic where Mini Motorways shines, offering players a unique take on both the puzzle and city-planning simulation ge…</span>

The Game Workers Alliance, a union of Raven Software quality assurance employees, has successfully voted to become officially recognized by Activision Blizzard. That makes them only the second formal union in the North American video game industry, following Video Games unionizing in December 2021, and the first within a major U.S. game publisher. 
According to the Washington Post, the Milwaukee branch of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) counted mailed-in ballots submitted by eligible Raven employees. Out of 22 ballots, 19 voted Yes, and 3 voted No. Parties have until May 31 to file an objection. If no one does, then the result becomes official. 
This story began last December in the wake of the ongoing Activision Blizzard sexual misconduct scandal. The publisher u…</span>

                              <span>I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that&#x27;s basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.
He&#x27;s a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like &quot;Ram Grenade Down Throat,&quot; &quot;Blow Opponent in Half,&quot; and &quot;Fire Hole Through Opponent.&quot; The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer&#x27;s archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.
I doubt we&#x27;ll ever see Lobo in a game, but there&#x27;s a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.</span>

Here are Game Informer, we loved Sonic The Hedgehog 2, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and while 2022 is void of much competition in the video game adaptation space, save for Uncharted, it’s one of our favorite video game movies in a while. Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well. 
In the meantime, check out this story about the scrapped “Ugly Sonic” movie design that makes a cameo in Disney Plus’ new Chip ‘n Dale movie.

                              <span>Fighting game fans and brawler fans rejoice! The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. 
The four sets respectively are:
Ryu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off
Chun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance
Guile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength
Ken Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect

The two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. 
“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” 
This collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year.

                              <span>Hot Wheels Unleashed is getting some content soon featuring some looney new vehicles and tracks. In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.
A brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they&#x27;re seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.
Hot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I&#x27;d assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.
The Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules. For more on Hot Wheels Unleashed, read our review of the racer here, and for more Looney Tunes nonsense, check out our preview and videos of MultiVersus.</span>

When I booted up Citizen Sleeper for the first time, it immediately enthralled me with its premise. Its dystopian transhumanist pitch – surviving as a digitized consciousness of a human body implanted into a robot designed to work for a mega-corporation – is refreshing in the cyberpunk genre of games. Its slick, clean, and unique art style, coupled with its score, a Tycho-esque take on sci-fi beats, told me I was in for a good time, assuming the gameplay would click. And at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to because its early …</span>

                              <span>2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. 
Lost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. 


Before launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. 


At launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  
You can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game&#x27;s price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.</span>

                              <span>Executive vice president and head of Marvel Games Jay Ong has revealed in a book that both Xbox and PlayStation were approached about making Marvel video games but only one of the console makers accepted the offer. 
A look around the gaming landscape reveals exactly which one, too: PlayStation, the company with an exclusive Spider-Man franchise, and an upcoming Wolverine game. And over on the Xbox side, you won’t find any new Marvel games developed by an Xbox studio because according to Ong, the company declined Marvel’s offer, opting instead to focus on its own IP, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


The book, Steven L Kent’s The Ultimate History of Video Games Vol 2, houses an excerpt where Ong explains this deal and how it led to Marvel prematurely terminating a contract it had wit…</span>

                              <span>Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service that combines Plus with PS Now back in March. Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. 
Funnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. 
As Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. 
Over on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  
While PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe&#x27;s Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.

B&amp;H Photo is asking $699 for a reference design by Sonnet, and that&#x27;s been matched by Amazon too. That&#x27;s $30 cheaper than it was last week, and shows the continued march of graphics cards towards reference design MSRPs.

                              <span>The Logitech MX Master is an incredibly popular series of office mice, and today the latest MX Master 3 has dropped from its usual price of $100 to just $55 at Office Depot. That&#x27;s a massive discount, achieved via a combination of an Office Depot price drop to $75, a 25% off code (SELFMADETECH) and a 30% back rewards code (90893995). 
This isn&#x27;t the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

                              <span>Every kid is a goddamn dork. Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

When fully in the grips of My Time At Sandrock, my little made-up computer game life is all I can think about.

Another way to celebrate yesterday was, apparently, to release a videogame. Apico, a beepkeeping sim about adventuring across a 2D world to collect, breed and conserve bees, is out now.

The acquisition includes the original IP associated with those studios, including Deus Ex, Thief, Legacy Of Kain and Tomb Raider. 

In their quarterly earnings report, Embracer now say they see &quot;great potential&quot; in leveraging the heck out of that IP with sequels, remakes and more.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 continues to receive updates as EA Dice attempt to fix a game that felt woefully incomplete at launch. Which makes it a little odd that the marquee change in patch 4.1 is the removal of a feature: Breakthrough mode can no longer be played with 128 players, and is now limited to 64. 

Not that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

I am not feeling the &#x27;comparing two similar things&#x27; approach I tried this week. How&#x27;s that meant to settle any serious matter? We tried, and we discovered science was a mistake.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We&#x27;re doing things differently this time as we&#x27;re discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020&#x27;s Hades. 
Unlike Supergiant Games&#x27; previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that&#x27;s developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it&#x27;s being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre&#x27;s large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!

In it, Chip and Dale deal with the realities of staying relevant in an industry that has changed significantly over the course of multiple decades. In one scene at a fan convention, the Rangers run into a familiar face that we never thought we&#x27;d actually see in a finished film, Ugly Sonic.
That&#x27;s right, the version of Sonic the Hedgehog that caused the 2020 film to be delayed and re-modeled makes his triumphant return in Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers. Polygon spoke with Akiva Schaffer, the director of Chip &#x27;n Dale, who said getting the rejected mascot likeness is one of h…</span>

The finale of the special GI Show review series is now available to watch or listen to here.

Microsoft is in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, Discovery and Time Warner have recently finished merging into one mega-media empire, and Sony is bringing Destiny developer Bungie into the PlayStation family. What we didn&#x27;t know about is a now-failed bid for NBC Universal to strengthen its hand by folding Electronic Arts into its corporate umbrella. 
According to a report from Dylan Byers at Puck News, the merging of EA into NBC Universal was well in motion until the deal fell apart in April. Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, is said to have wanted to inject the business with an influx of new IP and brands for some time now, and EA was in the crosshairs most rec…</span>

                              <span>The conclusion to the first season of Master Chief&#x27;s TV adventures is finally here, but did it stick the landing or continue to frustrate us? Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we&#x27;re reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.


The regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn&#x27;t do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.
In episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee&#x27;s decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that &quot;Transcendence&quot; has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.
When looking at the first season as a whole, it&#x27;s clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.&#x27;s tale and whether or not we&#x27;re excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.
Thank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we&#x27;re so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. 
What do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We&#x27;d also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future? Please email us at podcast@gameinformer.com or reach out on Discord as we want to know what you think.</span>

Fueled Up is a four-player couch co-op game set in space announced last month and the first trailer had us convinced it would make for some chaotic, and great, co-op sessions. We couldn&#x27;t help ourselves so we reached out to Fireline Games to ask if we could play it and they said yes. And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!


As you&#x27;ll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you&#x27;re wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it&#x27;s because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. 
VIDEO
Enjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they&#x27;re hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. 
For more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month.

Tchia was first announced at the 2020 Game Awards and unfolds on a beautiful island inspired by New Caledonia. Players control a young girl with the magical ability to inhabit the bodies of animals as well as inanimate objects, such as coconuts. Exploration involves sailing to different tropical islands in an open ocean as well as climbing through forests and soaring across the landscape on a glider. The game last appeared at the 2021 Game Awards where it got a 2022 release window.

Developer Awaceb posted an update on Twitter explaining that it needs to delay the game to tinker on it further, saying in part “this extra time will allow us to really polish every aspect of the game and flesh out all the little details that we know will make Tchia a really special experience.” 
Tchia is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC. You can catch up on every big game delayed to next year here.</span>

                              <span>First Person Shooter: The Ultimate FPS Documentary is an upcoming film that examines the history of the FPS genre through the lens of its designers and players. The project was successfully Kickstarted in 2021 and is gaining additional funding through an Indiegogo campaign. Game Informer shares an exclusive clip of the film covering the creation of Halo: Combat Evolved, including the importance of Master Chief and Cortana&#x27;s relationship from the eyes of its creators. 
The five-minute clip is a snippet from the over three-hour documentary that features over 100 hours of interview footage with designers such as John Carmack, John Romero, Cliff Bleszinski, Warren Spector, American McGee, and more. The film also includes insight from professional shooter players and industry experts as they unpack the genre&#x27;s origin, evolution, and impact on the industry and pop culture. 


First Person Shooter: The Ultimate FPS Documentary is directed by authors David L. Craddock and Chris Stratton. The project is in post-production and scheduled to release sometime during Q4 2022. You can learn more by visiting the movie&#x27;s Indiegogo campaign, which concludes on May 28.</span>

                              <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                              <span>Death Stranding hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019. Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. 
It seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. 
Death Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that.

                              <span>Super Rare Games has announced the Super Rare Mixtape Vol.3, a curated physical compilation of games from the “grassroots indie game scene” that harkens back to the days when mixtapes were physical items we could actually hold, and it looks awesome. 
As the name implies, this is the third indie game mixtape released by Super Rare. Like previous mixtapes, this one contains a ton of indie games, demos, concept art galleries, audio commentary tracks, and more. Only 2000 copies will be available for sale on PC and they’ll go live on May 26 at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. BST on superraregames.com. 
“Includes hardcore platformers, low-poly horrors, tactical games, classic RPGs, wholesome exploration games, arcade-like games, and even Dink Smallwood, a 1998 RPG that inspired huge games like Borde…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo announced in February that it plans to discontinue Wii U and 3DS eShop purchases in March 2023. However, the sunsetting process gradually rolls out throughout 2022. The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.
If you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  
Keep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. 
As a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”

                              <span>Players have speculated that Obi-Wan Kenobi could be making his way to Fortnite soon for a number of reasons. For starters, the upcoming Disney Plus show, Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins next week and Disney and Fortnite have an extensive history of collaborating ahead of big releases like movies or TV shows. There’s also the fact that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber is already in Fortnite as it was one of four added to the game during its May the Fourth Star Wars Celebration period. 
Now, it’s official: the Jedi master is coming to Fortnite to find the high ground. More specifically, he’ll hit the Fortnite Item Shop on Thursday, May 26, at 8 p.m. ET. That’s just in time for his big Disney Plus show, which begins the next day. As for what to expect, here’s a look:

According to Kim Dotcom, District Court Judge Liam O&#x27;Grady was replaced after the defense complained about his financial ties to Disney, which is listed as a victim of Megaupload&#x27;s alleged crimes.

And, I cannot believe how incorrect the &#x27;correct&#x27; answer is on a key-arranging level. The wrongest of the wrong. Look, come on, you tell me how you&#x27;d do it.

MultiVersus is Warner Bros&#x27; spin on a Super Smash Bros-like that&#x27;s free-to-play and features an all-star mishmash of franchises: Scooby Doo, Game Of Thrones, Adventure Time. Everyone is here! And having given its closed alpha a whirl, the game is great fun, even if its iterations on the Smash Bros formula aren&#x27;t all that impactful.

Axe-wielding goat lad Valtan arrives this month to finally incorporate team-based Legion Raids into the Western version of Lost Ark too.

                              <span>We did a lot of cool things during our time at this year&#x27;s PAX East. We attended a wonderful talk by &quot;Skyrim Grandma&quot; Shirley Curry. We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show&#x27;s official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show.

Wrapped up in that idea that they&#x27;re all pulled from a mysterious alien games console, CosmOS 9 packs nine games that are each meant to take 30-90 minutes. I&#x27;ve played a few and they seemed puzzle game staples, having me drawing paths through blocks, figure out how a mysterious computer interface worked, and such. See the breadth of the cosmic puzzling experience in the trailer below.

I&#x27;d launch Windows 3.1 just to watch screensavers, marvelling at Mystify and staring at Starfield. How wonderful that our computer needed to dream as preventative medicine! I relived this today with a new collection of customisable 3D screensavers, watching shoals of fish, taking a road trip through a museum of global electricity pylons, watching housing estates rise and fall, and seeing so many swirly colours.

What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they&#x27;re not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?
Because of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying &#x27;egg&#x27; a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew&#x27;s life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

Set three years before the events of the first game, it reverses the perspective with a new protagonist and a new setting, as well as aiming for &quot;more tactical&quot; combat. You can find the a cinematic announcement trailer below.

Alongside the previously announced third-person action game SteamWorld Headhunter, they&#x27;re also making a citybuilding game, a turn-based tactical shooter, and a puzzle game. Three of them are aiming for release next year.

                              <span>Being a father changes you. After years of resolutely hating on Sonic, my son&#x27;s interest in the characters, games and cartoon has softened me up. I will now begrudgingly admit that Sonic Boom is alright, and the first Sonic live action movie is better than expected. 

So here I am, looking at the new footage of Sonic Origins, which collects and remasters the blue hedgehog&#x27;s original platform games.

                              <span>Game Pass is particularly ideal for two kinds of games: indie games you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like enough to commit to the upfront cost, and decent-not-great blockbusters you know almost certainly aren&#x27;t worth the cost but would quite like to play for at least a bit.

There are plenty of games that fit into both of these categories joining the subscription service before the end of May, including Vampire Survivors, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Sniper Elite 5 and Jurassic World Evolution 2.

                              <span>Three or four times a year, someone at Square Enix says that news is coming about Final Fantasy and we all get our hopes up. This is one of those times. Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy VII Remake director, has said that &quot;various&quot; announcements are coming next month related to Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Will it be news about the second part of the FF7 Remake - or will it be, I dunno, a livestreamed concert and some phone wallpapers?

This should make the newly launched Core i9-12900KS, in a way, the realest deal of all: it’s structurally identical to the Core i9-12900K, originally the top-spec CPU in the series, but made with an even more discerning binning process. A component of the highest quality components, if you will, and as such can brush past the Core i9-12900K’s maximum boost clock speed of 5.2GHz to reach a scorching 5.5GHz.

Maybe you&#x27;re actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship&#x27;s load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment have announced the next news drop for Overwatch 2 will be taking place on June 16th. The game&#x27;s first PvP beta drew to a close today, but we should find out what&#x27;s next for the hero shooter at next month&#x27;s event. The blog post doesn&#x27;t give much away, all told, but according to the game&#x27;s official Twitter account the event will include more details about its next PvP beta. Fingers crossed for an invite this time.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that little inconsequential choices are better than controlling a turret. I am pleased that quite a few people did actually pick turrets. But this week, in the name of experimentation, I&#x27;m trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can&#x27;t imagine many will think this good, let&#x27;s give it a go, for science. Tell me, what&#x27;s better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

                              <span>Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like &quot;Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,&quot; and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly&#x27;s wing, indeed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we&#x27;ve heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you&#x27;d expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It&#x27;s a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like &quot;cops&quot;, &quot;switch car&quot; and &quot;plan&quot;, leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can&#x27;t think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

                              <span>3D gaming is… well, if not dead, then at best being kept in an iron lung by a teensy niche of enthusiasts. However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

                              <span>From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren&#x27;t exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn&#x27;t an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

In a handful of firsts for the collective, Phonopolis will not only be their first game with 3D graphics, but it&#x27;s also going to be the first that has actual narration rather than fun, nonsense noises. There&#x27;s no release date just yet, but have a watch of the teaser trailer below. It looks a real treat.

Místo se ovšem nemění, OpenAlt proběhne v tradičních prostorách Fakulty Informačních Technologií VUT v Brně.</span>

                              <span>Arma Reforger is the next game in the long-running military simulation series and will serve as an advance force for Arma 4, Bohemia Interactive have revealed during their ‘Future Of Arma’ stream today. Most of the information Bohemia had to relay was leaked over the weekend on Reddit, but it’s always good to get official confirmation of these things, amirite?

                              <span>The devastatingly stylish first-person photography game Umurangi Generation arrived on Game Pass today, so here&#x27;s me to nudge you to try one of our favourite games of 2020 (and 2021&#x27;s IGF Grand Prize winner). I can&#x27;t think of many other games which have you photographing scenes of daily life and struggle amidst a Neon Genesis Evangelion-grade cataclysmic kaiju event. It looks and sounds fantastic, too, with cool Jet Set Radio vibes.

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.

Stray Blade was first touted on the Xbox stream at last year’s Gamescom but it’s been in development for several years at the Berlin-based developers. The game stars an anthropologist who’s been sucked through a magic portal and dumped in the ‘Valley of Acrea’ with a little scarf-wearing wolf called Boji for company.

Now, the Ryzen 5 5600X is retailing for just £185 at Currys in the UK when you use the code FNDDGAMING, bringing a heretofore unseen level of performance to this price point.

Middling art sits atop a generic description that does its very best to not sell the game. &quot;Hunt for blood in nearby settlements... conquer the land of the living.&quot; Alrighteyyy, then. Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.
So, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you&#x27;ve closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.

                              <span>I’ve always been terrible at games. Truly. Trying to join in with any online multiplayer game has been met with quotes such as, &quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; and, &quot;Wow, 84 deaths? Really?&quot;, to name but a few. This led to scenarios where it felt far easier for me to give up and try something new.

                              <span>Downloading pirated movies and TV shows is against the law in the United States. The same is true for those who operate a pirate streaming site. However, people who use these streaming sites to consume pirated content may not be copyright infringers. Law professor James Gibson explains why.

The site was relatively small but has a unique history, as it initially launched as a tracker exclusively for Reddit users. A near-catastrophic technical failure in 2015 hit the site hard. While the site returned, it never reached its old highs again and staffers lost their motivation along the way.

                              <span>Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
