                    <span>Update, 12/14/2021 12:30 p.m. ET: The “hip hoppy walk” comment was mistakenly attributed to a writer, and not motion-capture and voice over director Tom Keegan, who actually made the comments. We have also updated the attribution of the journalist question in the piece.

                    <span>For its final update of the year, Xbox Game Pass is getting some of the best adventure games in recent memory, including Firewatch and Broken Age. But, like the strangest charcuterie station you’ll hover around next week, they’re paired with debatably the least chill game of the past few years: Mortal Kombat 11. …

                    <span>Let’s be honest: 2021 saw a number of games get released in a pretty shameful state. None were nearly as busted as the catastrophe that was—still is?—CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077, but this year’s crop of broken games was atrocious all the same. And though some eventually got patches that fixed various issues,…

                    <span>The Nintendo Switch had a pretty odd 2021, all things considered. This has been a bit of a slow year, and it is no wonder why. Developers were thrown into panic, as most of us were, by 2020’s covid-19 outbreak. While this did slow things down in 2020, a lot of games released that year were already mostly complete when…

                    <span>Joji Yanami was a mainstay in the Dragon Ball franchise. During his career, he voiced a number of Dragon Ball characters, as well as serving as the anime’s narrator. His agency Aoni Production announced that the veteran voice actor passed away on December 3 at the age of 90.

                    <span>So, Battlefield 2042, huh. People sure have opinions about Battlefield 2042. In fact you could drive a main battle tank through the divide between a lot of the critical and popular reaction to DICE’s latest, the first modern (or in this case near-modern) Battlefield since 2013&#x27;s Battlefield 4.

                    <span>Update, 12/14/21:
Slayer now has a dedicated playlist in Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer. 
343 Industries announced yesterday that despite what the studio previously said, a Slayer playlist would be coming to Halo Infinite before the year&#x27;s end. In fact, the team announced that it would be coming December 14 and that&#x27;s today. As expected, a Slayer playlist can now be found in Halo Infinite after updating to the current build of the game. 
A Tactical Slayer (SWAT), Fiesta, and Free-For-All playlist have been added as well. For more information about these playlists, head to 343 Industries&#x27; full update breakdown.

                    <span>Praey for the Gods has been in Steam Early Access since 2019, but it’s officially 1.0 as of…today! Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. 
The game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.

For those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.
You can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Inscryption is one of 2021’s biggest surprises in more ways than one. Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.
The update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. 
❗️Inscryption: Kaycee&#x27;s Mod❗️
https://t.co/ohMNIFpK6F pic.twitter.com/c7sfQHHNFi
December 14, 2021
To access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. 
In a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game. The expansion is billed as a beta, so expect some eventual balance changes as well as two new cards/items, more dev logs, and even a final encounter at the end of the 12th level.

                    <span>Nightdive Studio’s remake of System Shock has been in the works for some time. First announced in 2016, the game was tentatively planned to launch this past summer but will now arrive sometime in 2022.
Unfortunately, Nightdive still hasn’t nailed down an exact release date. It did announce a publishing deal with Prime Matter to help bring the game to PC and unspecified consoles. Taking place on an abandoned space station, the first-person game tasks players with surviving a hostile AI named SHODAN and the dangerous enemies lurking aboard.  The original 1994 game is widely considered a classic and a pioneer for story-driven first-person action games. 
Nightdive has also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in the gallery below.

An updated playable PC demo for System Shock was released in February, which you can still download on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Nightdive bills it as the final demo before the game’s full release. 
The wait continues, but some update is better than nothing (unlike the long-lost System Shock 3). In case you missed it, a live-action System Shock TV show is also in the works.</span>

                    <span>Arkane Studios has built a strong cult following over the last decade. Its expertise is developing immersive sims – games that facilitate unpredictable stories and emergent gameplay through player choice, complex AI, persistent systems, and sandbox level design. Like the best immersive sims, Deathloop encourages you to use its robust suite of tools to poke at its many systems and environments to differing results, which then allows you to piece together the best route through any place. However, unlike its predecessors Dishonored and Prey, Deathloop doesn’t have one specific mission, ability, or weapon that stands out as the best part of the adventure. Instead, it showcases how a game’s many elements can interact with one another to create a truly unique experience.
Specifically, the game’s level design and time of day system work together to create a setting that invites exploration and houses adaptive characters to provide consequences to player actions. Add in a consistent ruleset and shared design language that permeates every aspect of Deathloop, and you’ll understand why the title is one of the best releases of 2021.
There isn’t one particular thread greater than the rest. Deathloop is an impressive intersection of stories and gameplay systems woven together to create a tapestry deserving of your attention. In my latest video essay, I break down the game design behind Deathloop in an attempt to better understand one of the best games on PlayStation 5 and my personal favorite game of 2021:

                    <span>Windjammers 2 has been a long-time coming (it was first announced in 2018) and after years of betas, the sequel to the cult-favorite arcade game officially launches next month. 
That would be January 20, to be exact. As for platforms, Windjammers 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. It’s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass. Physical versions are also on the way courtesy of Limited Run Games, though it’s unclear if those will launch day and date with the digital editions. 
Windjammers features a roster of 10 characters, both originals and newcomers, and 10 courts to host the disc-throwing action. Like the 1994 original, two players battle out in what’s essentially over-the-top air hockey with frisbees. Lobbing the disc into the other player’s goal is key, and each character sports their own playstyle and special attacks. Windjammers 2 features new gameplay mechanics, an arcade mode, and online play with casual and ranked matches. Get the full rundown in the new trailer below.

Windjammers 2 is being developed by Dotemu, the team behind Streets of Rage 4 and publisher for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge.

                    <span>Chocobo GP is racing through the finish line in just a few months. 
More specifically, you can race as a Chocobo, your favorite Final Fantasy summon, heroes such as Terra, or someone else entirely when Chocobo GP hits Switch on March 10. That’s less than three months away so you might want to brush up on your kart racing skills soon. And if you’re looking for a great way to do that, look no further than Nintendo’s own Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, because Chocobo GP looks very, very similar in almost every regard.

From the item boxes, err, Magicites, placed throughout the track to the track design and even the way racers drift, Chocobo GP looks very much like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Look, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is arguably the best kart racer out there so it’s not surprising to see another racer take on a similar shape. Plus, if Final Fantasy is more your franchise versus Mario or any of the others highlighted in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then Chocobo GP might be your new favorite kart racer. 
Today’s March 10 release date news was announced in a release date trailer on the Nintendo UK YouTube channel. In it, we get more details about the game, including a brief look at its story mode, some of the characters we can expect to see, and more. We also learn that similar to other kart racers, a series will consist of four races. Although Chocobo GP has its own series ready to go at launch, players can create their own, too. 
The trailer also reveals a quick glimpse at a track we’ve not seen before – you can see it around the 1:26 minute mark and it looks like a Final Fantasy spin on Mario Kart Wii&#x27;s Moo Moo Meadows. Elsewhere in the trailer, you can see the castle track previously shown in the Chocobo GP announcement trailer.

                    <span>Nintendo has some indie games ready to show, and it sounds like we’ll all be getting a glimpse of them during the next Indie World showcase. 
Announced on Twitter today, Nintendo of America says a new Indie World showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. As for what to expect, well, there’s really no telling – considering the name of the event, you can obviously expect to see some indie games, but as for which ones, only Nintendo knows.
Get ready for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase arriving Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT!

Perhaps we’ll finally get some more information about Hollow Knight: Silksong, which was revealed in February 2019 as DLC that transformed into a full-blown sequel. 
We may also learn more about Sports Story, another hotly-anticipated indie game announced over two years ago. There’s a chance we don’t see Sports Story or Silksong, though, so don’t let the hype train leave the station just yet. Other possibilities include Metal Slug Tactics, Lumbearjack, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, all of which were shown back in August’s Indie World Showcase. 
Nintendo says this Indie World showcase will run for 20 minutes, and if it’s anything like previous Indie World showcases, it will, as the name implies, be focused on indie games … so don’t expect to see Breath of the Wild 2 or Splatoon 3 here. For a look at what was previously shown during the last Indie World showcase, which happened back in August, check out Game Informer’s full breakdown.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on “violations of the state’s civil rights and equal pay laws,” specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

If you don&#x27;t want to actually catch &#x27;em all, why not... clone &#x27;em all? A new glitch has been discovered in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl that can get you an entire box of cloned Pokémon and items.
Following an earlier cloning glitch, which was patched out, a new one has been found (and will, no doubt, also be patched out in time), and at time of writing, is still possible.

This guy — Karl Schecht, or &quot;Kommander Karl&quot; on social media — got really into reloading things as if they were weapons in a first-person shooter.

As you might expect, there are a lot of references to Zelda: Breath of the Wild in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity – it&#x27;s hardly a massive shock, given that both are based on the same version of the Zelda universe.
However, Twitter user Alexander Trevino has spotted one of the most subtle references yet, and it takes place during the game&#x27;s final cutscene. It sees Princess Zelda cooked up a recipe, and if you look closely, it&#x27;s actually one you can create in Breath of the Wild: Enduring Monster Stew.

Things have been quiet on the Chrono Trigger front, but according to a tweet from FantasyAnime — a website &quot;dedicated to classic fantasy RPG video games&quot; — that could be about to change.
For 22 years, FantasyAnime has been distributing the ROMs for select Square Enix games, including SaGa, the Mana series, Final Fantasy, and Chrono Trigger, but after receiving a cease and desist notice from Square Enix, they will be removed from the site.

Mario Kart 64 has a special place in many of our hearts, a game that transformed the look of the series and introduced a number of classic tracks. It has some great music too, and a project that we&#x27;ve enjoyed listening to throughout today has been Skario Kart: A Ska Tribute to Mario Kart 64.
It&#x27;s an album you can listen to on Bandcamp (and also purchase if you want a download copy), with some fantastic arrangements from various artists that add a different spin to the game&#x27;s music. And really, the name and cover art alone make it worth your time.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Stuart takes a look at the upcoming open-world Sonic game and ponders the promise it has, and pitfalls it has to negotiate...

The Game Awards were a double-header for us Sonic fans. A full trailer for the blue blur’s second movie and, more pertinently, our first real glimpse of the next major Sonic game, one Sonic Frontiers. And it’s been met with somewhat scornful comparisons to the absolutely exhausted benchmark of the “open-world” mega-genre, one The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Never mind the fact that Sonic was traversing big, open spaces back in 1991. What are “sandbox” locations if not extrapolations on the wide-linear likes of the original Green Hill Zone, eh? Riddle me that, Zelda. Maybe we could have a Sonic game where his sneakers break every fifteen seconds and you have to keep replacing them.

It seems like a lot of the &#x27;end of year&#x27; stuff is happening a little earlier, and Nintendo is pitching in by launching its rather neat &#x27;Year in Review&#x27; website.

North American Year In Review Page
European Year In Review Page

If you go to the official page while logged into your Nintendo Account it summarises your play activity and breaks it down into all sorts of stats. You can see how many games you played, how many were &#x27;new&#x27;, and of course your most played games in terms of hours. You also get a percentage showing your docked / portable split, for example.

Well, the reason you may have heard this one before — other than it happening to you — is that it&#x27;s the plot of CRYSTAR, an action-RPG that came out on PS4 back in 2018.

It Takes Two was undoubtedly the big story of The Game Awards last week, scooping up Best Family Game (which is an interesting take on that category, for sure) but more importantly the lucrative Game of the Year award. It&#x27;s an extremely stylish, fun and cleverly designed game, but also has to be played in co-op or not at all.
It&#x27;s a key part of the game&#x27;s creative vision, and with a friend&#x27;s pass system does its best to encourage players - someone who owns the game can play with a non-owner online if necessary. Yet Masahiro Sakurai drew some amusement on social media over the weekend with his take on playing the game solo.

                    <span>Everyone goes through a &#x27;goth&#x27; phase.
Clothing line BlackMilk has already done ranges based on Zelda and Mario, so the fact that it&#x27;s back with yet another video game-inspired selection should come as no surprise.
This time around, however, we&#x27;re looking at a set of items inspired by The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which, in turn, is based upon Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s series of fantasy novels.

                    <span>It&#x27;s like MASK, the video game!
Remember the flood of &#x27;high concept&#x27; movies during the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s? These were often simplistic in nature, with plots you could fit on the back of a postage stamp and still have room left over, but they were packed with action that got bums on seats – and that&#x27;s the vibe we&#x27;re getting from PikPok Games&#x27; Agent Intercept.
You assume the role of a James Bond-style hero who is equipped with a sports car that can transform into a speed boat and fighter jet, which basically makes this the dream game for anyone who lived through the &#x27;80s and enjoyed TV shows like MASK, Transformers and Action Force.

My Nintendo has been relatively busy in Europe this week, adding some Metroid Dread pins yesterday (which had previously been pre-order bonuses from the official UK store, for example) and has now added another goodie. This time around it&#x27;s a calendar (of sorts) that&#x27;s after your Platinum points.

                    <span>A little to the right.
Some people are content to let chaos rule their lives, and that&#x27;s fine. But for people like us — people who want their pens to be in rainbow order, and their pencils organised by length — the world can be frustrating. So many things at imperfect angles! Too many illogically-designed items of furniture!
But A Little To The Left, from K&#x27;jipuktuk/Halifax-based duo Max Inferno, is the perfect balm to soothe our frazzled nerves. Reminiscent of similar organisational games like Unpacking and Assemble With Care, A Little To The Left is all about tidying up your home with attention to colour, shape, and size. Just... watch out for your cat, who disagrees with your sensibilities.

                    <span>JRPG makes use of the &quot;Kawaii Physics&quot; plugin for Unreal Engine 4.
Shin Megami Tensei V is a fantastic video game, but have you noticed how good the hair looks? That&#x27;s all thanks to Unreal Engine 4&#x27;s “Kawaii Physics” plugin, used to animate things like swaying hair and clothing, such as skirts and dresses.
In SMTV, Kawaii Physics is used to animate Nahobino’s long blue hair. Nahobino’s a pretty active protagonist who is viewed mostly from behind, so you get a lot of time to admire their flowing locks.

                    <span>Seriously impressive stuff.
Stunt Race FX (known in Japan as Wild Trax) was quite an impressive feat when it launched. Sure, it looks hopelessly crude by modern standards, but back in the early &#x27;90s when 3D visuals were still in their infancy, it really turned heads – lest we forget, consoles like the SNES simply were not designed for this kind of three-dimensional trickery.
Another system that was never created with 3D graphics in mind was the Game Boy, but amazingly, someone has managed to produce a Stunt Race FX tech demo for the classic handheld. Sure, it has no gameplay (you can steer the car but that&#x27;s it), but the fact that it&#x27;s running at all is something to be marvelled at.

                    <span>Flux, but no capacity.
It seems as though the key to making a good Doctor Who game is... to not let the player take control of The Doctor. Developer Maze Theory&#x27;s recent (and rather excellent) Doctor Who: The Lonely Assassins was a compelling realisation of this concept, and now Doctor Who: The Edge of Reality is a somewhat more traditional take on the long-running series.
We don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial to say that Doctor Who has a patchy-at-best history with the medium of video games, from the Amiga&#x27;s Dalek Attack and earlier through to Charles Cecil&#x27;s The Adventure Games and well-meaning side-scroller The Eternity Clock. The misses, to put it bluntly, are a lot more recurrent than the hits. It&#x27;s an odd situation, because you&#x27;d think that Doctor Who has more than enough locations, creatures and general fodder for a rollicking great high-budget adventure. Unfortunately, said high budgets don&#x27;t appear to be in evidence, and The Doctor&#x27;s predilection for non-violent resolution — laudable as it is — doesn&#x27;t lend itself brilliantly to blasty-wasty video games.

There&#x27;s a long list of things you might not know about Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and today, that list just got a little longer.
We&#x27;re not sure why Gaming Reinvented pondered this particular issue, but it decided to see what would happen if a Hinox was introduced to a pool of boiling hot lava. To do this, the monster had to be coaxed from one of its potential spawn points to Death Mountain and then pushed into the red-hot magma, which is a time-consuming challenge in itself.

Sonic Frontiers is looking very impressive indeed, and promises to do for the Sonic franchise what Breath of the Wild did for Zelda – namely, reinvigorate it via the wonders of open-world exploration (or &quot;open-zone&quot; as Sega prefers to call it).
However, some people online have called out Sega (light-heartedly, we should add) for seemingly copying an Unreal Engine tech demo from a few years back.

                    <span>Now that&#x27;s winning.
Super Mario Bros. 3 is an all-time classic, and particularly impressive when you consider the technology it relied upon. The 16-bit SEGA Genesis was right around the corner in Japan by the time the Famicom version launched in Japan, for example, yet Nintendo delivered what was a huge step up for its flagship series.
The overworld map added to its perceived scale, but the nature of memory management back in the day meant that Nintendo will have been using all sorts of coding tricks to squeeze all of the game&#x27;s overworld locations, stages and minigames onto a humble cartridge. Now, with eager enthusiasts and ROMs at our disposal, these workarounds and coding are often deconstructed.

After almost three years in early access, Praey has reached v1.0, adding two new boss battles in the process.

Now there&#x27;s a soundless gameplay trailer of Stargate in action, and ooh, it looks a lot like Commandos.

The hope for crypto land barons is that they would be able to earn money back from other players through in-game business partnerships.

The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game&#x27;s community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.
Paralives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims&#x27; supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we&#x27;ve had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what&#x27;s the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they&#x27;re not well cool?

That next free game is Plunder Panic, a swashbuckling pirate &#x27;em up in which teams of up to six players battle it out on the high seas. Here&#x27;s how to get your copy.

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

Call of Duty: Vanguard was the best-selling game of last month in the U.S., with Battlefield 2042 coming in right behind it as the second best-selling game of November.

                    <span>Update, 12/13/21:
Thunder Lotus has revealed that Spiritfarer has surpassed 1 million copies sold, a massive milestone for the indie game, and if that&#x27;s not enough, the latest and final update, the Jackie &amp; Daria Update, is out today. 
For more details about the Jackie &amp; Daria Update, check out the original story below. 
Original Story, 12/13/21:
Spiritfarer is getting the final batch of content from its 2021 roadmap, and developer Thunder Lotus bills it as the most significant addition yet. Jackie and Daria are two new spirits joining the fray alongside an uncharted island to explore and a new event. 
The free update arrives on December 13 for all versions of the game. The story sees Stella visit a rundown hospital situated on an unknown island. She meets Jackie, a caretaker and spirit in the form of a hyena, and Daria, a bat and Jackie’s patient. By befriending these two lovable spirits, you’ll help them get the hospital up and running again. As seen in the trailer below, the update adds a new platforming-focused event, and you outfit your ferry with new upgrades.

As previously noted, the Jackie &amp; Daria update will be the game’s last. Two previous add-ons introduced two other spirits, Lily and Beverly, and their respective stories. Now that Spiritfaer is wrapped up, we look forward to seeing what Thunder Lotus has up its sleeve next. 
Spiritfarer is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. You can read our review here to find out why it’s a gem you shouldn’t overlook.</span>

                    <span>The Anacrusis, the four-player co-op FPS set aboard a 1960s-esque starship, will be released as an Early Access title on January 13 and it will hit Xbox Game Pass the same day. 
First shown during an Xbox event held earlier this year, The Anacrusis carries with it some sci-fi Left 4 Dead vibes – be it the hordes of aliens, the four-player co-op elements, or the fact that it’s an FPS, The Anacrusis seems like a day-one game for anyone that’s a fan of Valve’s zombie shooter. Oh, and Anacrusis developer Stray Bombay was co-founded by Left 4 Dead lead developer, Chet Faliszek.

The first full year of a new platform cycle is always exciting. Developers have new technologies to leverage in game releases, and players begin to glimpse the potential of new hardware. This particular new generation of gaming has had an unusual start. The global pandemic meant significant changes to development pipelines, causing production setbacks and global shipping delays. This resulted in games arriving later and new hardware that was difficult to find – even for the most diligent gaming enthusiasts.
Despite those challenges, 2021 came together as an excellent year for video games, filled with remarkable new experiences for players to enjoy. We’ve selected and ranked our picks for the 10 best releases of the year, detailing exactly why these particul…</span>

                    <span>In the year since its launch, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has proven to be one of the more robust and popular installments of the long-running franchise. Recent entries like Odyssey received an impressive amount of post-release content in its first year. But even after releasing several successful, large-scope expansions in 2021, Valhalla is going strong and appears ready to outpace its predecessor by continuing its Viking voyage into a second year.
The Dawn of Ragnarök is the centerpiece of that ongoing rollout, a major new expansion set to be released in late winter, aiming to add a considerable chunk of new missions, environments to explore, and even gameplay-altering new character powers. That major expansion is steering toward launch in March, but you don’t need to wait that long to get…</span>

                    <span>The Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for 35 of the last 36 months, having lost to the PlayStation 5 back in September. The streak continued this November. 
Announced in a press release today, the Switch was the best-selling console in the U.S. in November after selling more than 1 million units. The press release cites the NPD Group, which regularly reports on U.S. video games sales each month, and according to the group, the Switch sold 1.13 million units last month. Of course, those 1.13 million units are split between the three variants of the console currently on the market: the Switch, the Switch Lite, and the OLED Model, which was just released in October.

“For the important holiday-shopping week of Thanksgiving, which includes Black Friday, Nintendo Switch was also the top-selling video game console, with nearly 550,000 systems sold,” the press release reads. “With November logged in the record books, Nintendo Switch has now been the top-selling video game console for 35 out of the last 36 months.” 
Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who recently appeared at The Game Award 2021 to accept the Best Action/Adventure Game award for Metroid Dread, says as Nintendo heads into 2022 and the sixth year of Switch, “the system continues to see strong demand” and that the company looks “forward to even more people adding Nintendo Switch to their households.”

                    <span>Microsoft closed Lionhead Studios, the team behind the publisher’s famed Fable series, on April 29, 2016, and since then, it’s remained pretty much silent on that closure. However, in a new Xbox-focused documentary, Microsoft seems to regret how it handled Lionhead, as reported by IGN. 
Power On: The Story of Xbox was announced back in November, and now, the six-part documentary is available for viewing. Running over four hours long, this documentary series covers the entire history of Xbox, including its closure of Lionhead five years ago. Xbox general manager of global games publishing, Shannon Loftis, revealed how the company considered this closure and how it was handled.

The missions will be available for free tomorrow, with one available in each game.

                    <span>Ever wanted to stick your pick deep into the centre of an octopus? How about a bug or a barnacle? If none of that tickles your pick(le)s you could try a keyhole which twists dimensions? Or perhaps one with a steampunk or frost-bitten feel? If literally any of that got your immersion senses tingling then three Skyrim modders have something for you. Creating a cache of realistic looking catches, they have brought the Dragonborn what they&#x27;ve been desperate for; a more riveting lockpicking experience.

                    <span>As someone with bipolar, I have often wondered why sinking several hours into something soothing such as Shovel Knight does so much for my soul. However I recently read that Geek Therapy, a non-profit advocating the use of video games for wellness, promote using world-building games such as Minecraft, Roblox, Animal Crossing, and Fortnite to help people deal with mental health issues. While play therapy has long promoted the therapeutic powers of escapism to imaginary worlds, it is more recently that thought has gone into how these online experiences can be used to combat my, I mean someone&#x27;s, anxiety and depression.

                    <span>Intel’s latest 12th Gen Alder Lake processors include some of the best gaming CPUs money can buy, and they’re not just a big step forward on pure power. They also add support for some new and up-and-coming technologies that that could form the bedrock for even better performance in the future, like PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 RAM. In fact, when buying a new, Alder Lake-compatible motherboard, you’ll have a choice to make: stick with DDR4 memory, or upgrade to DDR5?

                    <span>Activision Blizzard employees are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company, holding walkouts in the wake of damning reports and layoffs. It&#x27;s reached a point where ABK employees are organising a formal strike, and there&#x27;s been talk of unionisation - talk that ActiBlizz would like to stop. In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because &quot;active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees&quot; is better than unionisation, apparently.

                    <span>Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)
Instead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.

                    <span>I usually don&#x27;t like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I&#x27;m not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It&#x27;s a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead&#x27;s Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

                    <span>Update: Yup, it&#x27;s official.
Original story:
Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. They&#x27;re not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it&#x27;s an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

                    <span>While the Pacific map in Call Of Duty: Warzone ushered in a new WW2 era of beachside battle royale, it also added weapon bloom. Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn&#x27;t hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn&#x27;t the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it&#x27;ll take time to fully remove.

                    <span>Instrukce 3DNow! vydalo AMD k rozšíření multimediálních instrukcí MMX v roce 1998 a poprvé se objevily v procesoru AMD K6–2. Nedošlo však k masovému rozšíření, byly překonány instrukcemi SSE od Intelu. Posledním procesorem s podporou 3DNow!  byl  K10 z roku 2011, Bulldozer ze stejného roku již 3DNow! neměl. V jádře se ještě používají pro procesory bez SSE například pro rychlé kopírování paměti memcpy.</span>

Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon launches tomorrow and offers an intriguing change of pace for everyone’s favorite shovel-wielding hero/obligatory indie cameo star. After countless matches, I can say its action-oriented spin on tile-matching puzzle games works well. Assuming you can put up with a surprisingly steep difficulty curve, Pocket Dungeon is worth checking out if you’re looking for a new puzzler to chip away at.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography has explored the history of the Metroid series, but it&#x27;s time to wrap the season by talking about, arguably, the biggest Nintendo game of the year: Metroid Dread.
On October 8, 2021, Metroid Dread was released for Nintendo&#x27;s Switch. Nintendo heralded the title as the end of an era for the series, but considering how well it&#x27;s selling, it could also be the beginning of another golden age. Oddly, Dread might have one of the longest teases in history, as its name first appeared back in 2005. In this week&#x27;s show, we talk about our problems with the game&#x27;s controls, what we thought of the difficulty, and what its big narrative reveal means for Samus&#x27; future. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, soon-to-be-GameSpot-editor Jessica Howard (@awildjessichu) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Dread&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>The Sniper Elite series has found a comfortable 7/10 groove, ploughing the territory halfway between Hitman and Call Of Duty and planting seeds by letting you shoot the bollocks off a Nazi. The next in the series was officially revealed during this week&#x27;s Game Awards, and you can find the first trailer below.

                    <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake is finally headed to PC on December 16th, as announced during The Game Awards. That&#x27;s great news, but there&#x27;s a catch: Square Enix are selling it at the next-gen console price of £65/$70/€80.

                    <span>Rebellion has announced Sniper Elite 5 will be coming next year, bringing the series to France while staying within the timeframe of World War II. In it, you play as super sniper Karl Fairburne, who is on a mission to take out high-ranking officers and find out the secret to something called Project Kraken.

Karl&#x27;s adventures through the French cities and countrysides won&#x27;t be pleasant, and he&#x27;ll have to rely on more than his sharpshooting skills to stay alive. The debut trailer shows plenty of weaponry at Fairburne&#x27;s disposal, like automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and good old-fashioned knives. Returning is the gruesome x-ray effect on devastating neck stabs or pinpoint accurate sniper shots that cause the target&#x27;s internals to explode spectacularly. 
Last night, keen-eyed viewers of The Game Awards might have spotted Sniper Elite 5 on the list of upcoming day one Game Pass releases. The game is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2022.

                    <span>Scorn was one of the first games announced for the Xbox Series X/S, but we still don’t know a ton about it, and it vanished from the limelight for over a year. Developer Ebb Software has finally spoken up to remind us that Scorn is still very much happening – in fact, it’s arriving next October. 
A cryptic trailer revealed the release window but didn’t divulge any new plot or gameplay details. A new community post on the game’s Kickstarter page only offers a behind-the-scenes look at the game’s art direction.

Ebb CEO Ljubomi Peklar issued a statement on the game, saying: 
“We’re really pleased to be able to share more news on the game and its release date. Scorn has been a real work of passion for the entire studio. The atmosphere, the journey, and the experience, we want every moment in Scorn to elicit an emotional response and feeling. It is our hope that Scorn stays with players long after they reach its ending. We’re looking forward to sharing more news and updates with our community as we move closer to launch”
So far, we know that Scorn is a first-person shooter set within a labyrinthine world heavily inspired by the art of H.R. Giger. The pulsating walls and grotesque enemies send the appropriate shivers up our spines, and we’re glad to see the project still has a pulse. The last time we saw Scorn in action was in a 14-minute gameplay demo that you can watch here.
Scorn is launching to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

Among the numerous announcements to come out of The Game Awards, The Matrix Awakens was one of the coolest as well as the most puzzling. Not quite a game, per see, this free interactive experience serves as a tech demo to showcase Unreal Engine 5&#x27;s horsepower using The Matrix universe as a backdrop. To say that it looks great is an understatement. We&#x27;re still trying to lift our jaws off the floor thanks to the life-like fidelity of Awakens&#x27; city. 
Awakens puts you in control of an original character, though you do get to hang with Neo and Trinity during an exciting on-rails car chase/shooting gallery that we&#x27;ll partially show off. You&#x27;ll also get a glimpse at how Awakens lets players tinker with development tools to alter the look and feel of its world. 
Join Alex Stadink, Marcus Stewart, and Andrew Reiner as they delve into The Matrix Awakens&#x27; stunning digital playground. Be sure to check out our round-up of all the big announcements from The Game Awards, as well as the full list of award winners.</span>

                    <span>Sony&#x27;s first-party efforts grew stronger today with the acquisition of Seattle-based developer, Valkyrie Entertainment. Since 2002, Valkyrie has worked on over 100 games, often serving the role of co-developer or content creator. In a tweet, Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said Valkyrie &quot;will be making invaluable contributions to key PlayStation Studios franchises.&quot;
Valkyrie has worked with Sony several times in the past, helping bring Infamous, God of War, and Twisted Metal to market. The developer will once again be working with Sony Santa Monica on God of War: Ragnarok. 
In a press release issued earlier today, a Sony spokesperson outlined the path forward. &quot;The day-to-day operations post-acquisition will continue to be run by Valkyrie Entertainment’s current management team. Terms of this transaction including the acquisition cost are not disclosed due to contractual commitments.&quot;
Along with the acquisition, Valkyrie has a big reason to celebrate, as it was one of the studios involved in helping create Halo Infinite, the fantastic sequel that we awarded a review of 9.25 out of 10. Other games that have Valkyrie&#x27;s touch are pictured in the image above.
Sony and Microsoft are in a bit of an arms race, snatching up developers over the last few years to broaden their respective first-party game development efforts.</span>

                    <span>Another regional form for Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been announced, and this time it&#x27;s a new version of Voltorb.
Typically a pure electric type, the Hisuian Voltorb is grass and electric, joining Rotom Mow as the only two Pokémon that share the two elements. Like its gen-1 predecessor, Hisuian Voltorb still resembles a Pokéball, only now, instead of looking metallic and grumpy, this sphere has angular, joyful eyes and wood grain throughout its lower half. The design is somewhat closer to the Pokéballs you&#x27;ll find or craft while playing Legends: Arceus. It has a mysterious opening on the top of its head, which the Pokémon website says spouts seeds, though &quot;it’s impossible to see anything even if one peers into the hole.​&quot; When this Voltorb gets excited or feels like it&#x27;s in danger, that same hole is the source of discharged electricity.

Along with the announcement of Hisuian Voltorb, The Pokémon Company has released an adorable stop-motion animated short featuring the two-toned orb cheerfully irritating a Pikachu, Spheal, and Buneary. The video ends with a &quot;to be continued,&quot; so hopefully, we&#x27;ll learn more about Voltorb or its potential Hisuian Electrode evolution in the next one. With so many types of Pokéballs out there, with various designs and colors, I&#x27;d love to see a bunch of variations of Voltorb to match the look of a Quick Ball or a Nest Ball.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a semi-open world adventure where players step back in time to explore the Hisui region, which we now know as Sinnoh from Diamond and Pearl. Trainers take a more active role in battle and catching wild Pokémon, bringing the concept of the franchise a little further from its purely turn-based roots. Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches for Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022.</span>

                    <span>2019’s Bury Me, My Love offered one of the most uniquely told narratives in recent memory (not to mention being quite emotional). We’ve been curious as to what developer The Pixel Hunt had up its sleeve next, and we found out yesterday with the reveal of its next project, The Wreck.
The Wreck is billed as a mature 3D visual novel. It stars a failed screenwriter named Junon who must relive one of the most important and, if the trailer is any indication, traumatizing days of her life. The Pixel Hunt describes the story as a tale about “sisterhood, motherhood, grief, and survival.”

In terms of gameplay, you’ll converse with a small cast of characters to explore Junon’s past in a non-linear story. With Junon dealing with emotional stress and her mother in critical condition, revisiting and coming to terms with a challenging past and present sounds easier said than done. Though the trailer establishes the tone,  the gallery of screenshots below provides a better idea of how moment-to-moment gameplay appears and the game&#x27;s dream-like quality.

                    <span>The Nintendo 64 library of the Switch Online Expansion Pack gets a dose of Rare next month when Banjo-Kazooie joins the service.
The game joins the service sometime in January, but there&#x27;s no exact date as of yet. The 1998 platformer is widely remembered as a standout game for the N64 (especially for third-party games) and among the most beloved games of the era overall. While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn’t been universally loved, it’s cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection.

Beneath exhilarating rollercoaster rides and silly conversations with squirrels, It Takes Two has a heavy heart. It’s about divorce and the toll taken on a daughter who doesn’t want to lose her family. It’s about decaying love and the differences that divide us. It’s about not wanting to face reality and not wanting to let go. It’s also about hope and uncertainty, the past creating a better future, and finding common ground no matter how much it may hurt. All of these elements are beautifully woven into a colorful and soulful adventure that hits hard, both in its moving narrative an…</span>

                    <span>Two days removed from the launch of Halo Infinite, we finally have our first look at Halo The Series, the long-awaited Paramount+ adaptation of gaming&#x27;s favorite Spartan.
While there aren&#x27;t any ring-like space mechanisms the games are named for, the initial peek at Halo The Series gave us plenty to be excited about. It features plenty of Spartans, interstellar asteroid civilizations, and most importantly, Master Chief doing a cool, heroic landing and pose in the sand. 
Dr. Halsey narrates the piece, likely speaking to John-117 about how she&#x27;s counting on him to be special and he gives people hope. We get some beautiful shots of human cities, Chief exploring some stony ruins, and what looks to be a brilliantly-lit alien structure. The Covenant is said to play a large role as an antagonist in the series, though we don&#x27;t catch a glimpse of the coalition of extraterrestrial races quite yet.

Halo The Series is produced in coordination with Showtime, Amblin Television, and 343 Industries. It stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117,  Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066, and Jen Taylor reprising her role as the AI Cortana. The show hits Paramount+ sometime in 2022.

Arc Raiders is an upcoming free-to-play cooperative shooter by Embark Studios, which is comprised of previous DICE employees who worked on the Battlefield series. Embark took to The Game Awards to unveil its project, Arc Raiders, offering our first big look at the game in action.
With Robyn&#x27;s &quot;Dancing On My Own&quot; serving as the trailer&#x27;s anthem, we were introduced to deadly mechanized threats coming from space that must be brought down with the cooperation of your squad. Plenty of gunfire and explosions naturally ensue. But then the trailer shows humongous mechanized beings that take up the entire screen, giving the fights a David versus Goliath feel. You are playing as the underdog and must work together with your team to shoot off enemy parts and make sure everyone stays alive. In one cool scene, a character launches toward the giant being and chucks a grenade right at its center. The trailer ends by saying: &quot;They will never stop coming,&quot; and shows an armored baddie with red eyes rising. You can watch it for yourself above.
The game&#x27;s description on Steam says players will wield tools and gadgets to outsmart the enemy and use physics to their advantage for success. 
Arc Raiders is set to come out in 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Previous trailers and tons of footage from the closed Network Test have given players a decent amount of information to pick apart and sort through regarding the upcoming From Software action-RPG Elden Ring. Today at The Game Awards 2021, we were treated to yet another taste of what&#x27;s to come. Suppose you&#x27;re looking for more information on Elden Ring. In that case, you might want to check out an extensive write-up of everything we discovered in hours and hours of wandering around the Network Test – or join us on video for some hot and spicy commentary. Today, players got a little more context about the world that From Software and G.R.R. Martin have created for Elden Ring. Check out the entire trailer below.

The trailer details the downfall of the demigods, with some style and flair. Wars raged between the demigods, with a grand battle between two champions. A mysterious character narrates the whole thing, and all it does is raise more questions. Well, hopefully, we&#x27;ll have some answers – and can start exploring – soon enough.
What do you think this means for Elden Ring? After Bloodborne&#x27;s mid-game surprise shift, I think everyone&#x27;s anticipating that there are plenty of exciting secrets in store. These games are often better experienced without a full spoiler suite. Still, it&#x27;s likely that any big revelations and surprises will be saved for post-launch as we continue to see parts and pieces stitched together from the early-game experience. What did you think of the trailer? Let us know in the comments! Elden Ring is slated to land on February 25, 2022 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</span>

                    <span>The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal 5 Experience has officially been revealed and it’s available to experience on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S right now. 
Revealed during The Game Awards 2021 by none other than Keanu Reeves, who plays Neo in the Matrix franchise, and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, this experience is a visual showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 is capable of. During The Game Awards 2021, Reeves and Moss were found in front of the iconic dodge-a-bullet-by-bending-really-far-backwards-scene from the first Matrix movie.

Reeves jokes that he can’t pull off moves like that anymore, but he says in Unreal Engine 5, he can. Then, we see some footage from Matrix Resurrections, which oddly enough features footage from The Matrix, too. From there, we returned to Reeves and Moss, who ask, “what is a game and what is a movie?”
Following this, the duo revealed the world premiere of The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience and it was quite impressive, if not a touch veering into uncanny valley territory.

It turns out that this experience is playable and seems to take place during a scene in which Neo and Trinity are dodging enemies while racing down a street. We haven’t played it yet, but if we had to guess, it plays like a shooter of sorts. It appears to be a tech demo with playable elements.

                    <span>Planet of Lana, the debut project from developer Wishfully Studio received a new trailer tonight at The Game Awards. 
One of the most notable things about the game&#x27;s appearance at tonight&#x27;s show was the announcement of its composer: Takeshi Furukawa, the BAFTA Award-winning composer for The Last Guardian. We got a taste of his music as it played over the game&#x27;s trailer, which shows a character riding atop some kind of robotic horse throughout a desert. As this happens, the character is chased by a group of rocket-powered, spider-like creates. The trailer ends with the character thrown from their horse, as small, cat-like creature paws at them.
Check out the trailer below.

Planet of Lana is expected to be released in 2022 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>We’ve known about the co-op horror FPS called GTFO for a long time now, and the game has been in Early Access for exactly two years. For the game’s second anniversary of play, 10 Chambers Collective has released the full launch version.
GTFO follows a group of prisoners who are sent down into a dangerous crater by a mysterious individual named the Warden, there to scavenge for supplies and weapons and complete a variety of tasks. The action focuses on four-player teamwork, where you must balance stealth and more active combat situations to survive and escape. The game has won praise in its early access phase for its tense action and scary moments.
The game is now available to play in full on PC, and you can watch the gameplay trailer below.

                    <span>Techland&#x27;s Dying Light 2 Stay Human got a new trailer during The Game Awards, showcasing some of the grim realities of the harsh world coming next February. Not only does the trailer serve up an impressive visual showcase, but it also highlights one of the most significant conflicts that can happen in the myriad hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenarios, where humans are at each other&#x27;s throats as one of the most dangerous threats of all. It&#x27;s almost like one of the challenges in these survival scenarios is to stay human despite society and the world crumbling into chaos. Oh wait, they put that in the title just in case we forgot. Nice! Anyway, check out this cool trailer that explores some pretty gruesome and grim stuff. Zombies are scary, and tough choices will be made in this game for sure.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is scheduled to land on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 4, 2022.</span>

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem, sequel to 2019&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Innocence, made its unexpected debut during E3 back in June. That moment came by way of a cinematic trailer, but tonight&#x27;s Game Awards provided a first look at gameplay. To the surprise of no one who played the original, there are rats. Lots and lots of rats. 
Amicia and Hugo are off on another dark quest and the biggest difference is that Amicia gets her hands a lot dirtier this time around. She&#x27;s gone from wielding just a slingshot and hiding in the shadows to firing crossbows in what looks to be more involved combat. Of course, the supernatural rat plague remains the star and the swarm look deadlier (and more visually impressive) than ever.

A Plague Tale: Requiem launches to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2022. It&#x27;s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

Rocksteady debuted the first gameplay trailer for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at The Game Awards. In it, we get to see how the unlikely team of villains gets around Metropolis and the ways they deal with Brainiac&#x27;s hordes of mind-controlled soldiers and other eldrich-looking monstrosities. 
However, the footage didn&#x27;t go off as planned. Debra Wilson&#x27;s Amanda Waller hacked into the production and appeared on stage to lecture host Geoff Keighley about releasing classified information. She still let us see the game despite the threats. I&#x27;m not sure why; I&#x27;m not a security expert.
We got a great look at the Squad&#x27;s mobility and combat capabilities in the extended trailer. Harley Quinn grapples to what looks like bat-drones to swing around the ai…</span>

                    <span>Iron Galaxy Studios has announced Rumbleverse, a new colorful free-to-play brawler with 40-player online multiplayer. 
Announced during The Game Awards 2021, the Rumbleverse debut trailer showcases some of the fun and zany characters we’ll be playing as in the new brawler. It seems quite expansive too. Fighters in the trailer jump all around a city, scaling buildings and more. According to a press release about the game, players will use an “ever-changing arsenal of elbow drops, powerbombs, and dropkicks” to defeat others.

You’ll be able to customize your brawler, of course, as each has 14 points of customization.
While what we saw in the trailer looked great, it was purely cinematics. However, TGA host Geoff Keighley revealed that Rumbleverse will have a special gameplay event tomorrow, and it sounds like we’ll be seeing actual gameplay then. This first look is tomorrow, December 10, from 12 p.m. EST to 6 p.m. EST. 
Based on a title screen at the end of the trailer, Rumbleverse is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via the Epic Games Store. There’s no mention of Steam, so it seems if you want to play Rumbleverse on PC, you’ll need to do so through the Epic Games Store. 
“Welcome to Grapital City,” a description of Rumbleverse reads on the game’s official website. “This city was built to celebrate the glorious traditions of melee combat – and you’re invited. Create a unique champion. Get shot out of a cannon. Smash crates to find upgrades. Pick a fight and battle to the last.” 
If you’re interested in checking out Rumbleverse for yourself, you can sign up to jump into Early Access at Rumbleverse.com.

                    <span>In one of The Game Awards&#x27; shortest reveals of the night, developer Innersloth announced the wildly popular Among Us is heading to VR. That&#x27;s right; you&#x27;ll be able to voluntarily strap yourself into a simulated crewmate helmet and attempt to survive while a murderous imposter roams your ship. Or, you could be the one stabbing your friends in the back as they go about trying to swipe that key card just right. 
The trailer only showed a glimpse of the VR game&#x27;s new look, but the 3D reimagining doesn&#x27;t seem to deviate too wildly from Among Us&#x27; simplistic design. The footage shows us what it will look like to stand in the Skeld, scanning around suspiciously at the several vents strewn about the room while trying to punch in a series of numbers in the keypad before us. Everything seems fine...until it isn&#x27;t and the screen goes blank. Among Us VR seems like a fertile ground for jump scares. 
The team did not share more about the title in the trailer, but Innersloth&#x27;s website gave us a little more to go on:
really have an emergency meeting together. (Note: VR version won&#x27;t be compatible with the original Among Us game, so you&#x27;ll only be able to play against other VR beans.)

Platforms, release dates, and additional information around Among Us VR will be announced at a later date. To stay updated, you can follow our new Among Us VR Twitter account or keep an eye on our site right here.</span>

                    <span>We got our first look at Dune: Spice Wars this evening, and the game is clearly looking to follow-up on a long-established claim of success in the strategy genre.
The new trailer is mostly atmospheric, and we hear a lot of place and character names that firmly entrench the new game in the Dune fiction. As the camera pans out from a scene on Arrakis, we see a giant hand holding a portion of the planet, sand slipping from its fingers.
The game’s official site has more detail to offer, promising that Dune: Spice Wars is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements. The game is being developed by Shiro Games, the team behind the survival game called Northgard.
In the new Spice Wars game, players take charge of a faction vying for control of Arakkis, the only place in the universe where Spice can be found, a substance that can expand consciousness and allow for space travel across vast distances. Of course, players can take control of familiar factions like Atreides and Harkonnen, but it sounds like other factions are an option as well. The game is also promising a variety of mechanics and ways to aim for victory, including subterfuge, politics, growth of economy, or straight-up warfare. The game boasts 4X dynamics in real-time, as players will explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate while they seek control of the vast desert planet.
Dune: Spice Wars is coming to early access first to help further development of the project, and the first chance to try the game is on the way in 2022.
Dune is experiencing a particularly potent resurgence at the moment thanks to the new and successful film, and this first glimpse of the new game looks promising.

Forspoken is an upcoming action/role-playing game from Square Enix&#x27;s Luminous Productions, and it has some top-tier talent behind it. The game&#x27;s writing team includes Gary Whitta, Amy Hennig, Allison Rymer, and Todd Stashwick, to name a few. But we still haven&#x27;t seen much about the game, which centers on a young woman named Frey who gets transported from New York City to a fantastical world. A new trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight changed that, introducing us to one of Frey&#x27;s adversaries, played by Pollyanna McIntosh (The Walking Dead). 
In the trailer, Frey begs to go home and says she doesn&#x27;t know how she got to this strange world. But it looks like she&#x27;s not exactly having a great time, as she has to contend with fire-breathing dragons and other animal and human threats attacking her. And she&#x27;s pretty much getting blamed for everything, with people saying she trespassed on the land and set this battle into motion. Thankfully, she has some cool magic at her disposal, and what looks like a hoverboard to get around with ease. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action. 
Forspoken launches on May 24 for PS5 and PC. The game is said to leverage the graphical capabilities of Sony&#x27;s new system, with ray tracing and procedural generation.</span>

                    <span>Tchia was one of the best looking game&#x27;s at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, and looked even better at this year&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase. It&#x27;s simultaneously a bit Wind Waker, a bit Breath Of The Wild, and a bit Disney. This year&#x27;s trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

In future I won&#x27;t have to produce my own Radio Edit, however. During last night&#x27;s Game Awards, Microsoft announced that the service, on PC, is now simply called PC Game Pass.

                    <span>My mates and I are doing the dishes, discussing whether we’ll see the region of Noxus feature more prominently in the next season of Arcane, an animated series based on League Of Legends. In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties &amp; Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

                    <span>While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

                    <span>I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can&#x27;t really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

                    <span>When I heard that Quantic Dream are making a Star Wars game, I felt much as I did when I found out my home town Swindon had been twinned with Disney World: you&#x27;d have expected Disney to Google some stuff first.
Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let&#x27;s be honest: that trailer is cracking. It&#x27;s really good. And it&#x27;s so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren&#x27;t going to spectacularly boot this.

                    <span>Needs must, gentle friends, needs must, and in particular I need to once more head into the dank and dreary evidence basement of the RPS treehouse. Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven&#x27;t been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It&#x27;s about speculative biology. Oh no.

                    <span>Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we&#x27;ll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It&#x27;s a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He&#x27;s one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There&#x27;s plenty of that nonsense in Ewins&#x27; set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a motorist in south west England, chances are you&#x27;ve probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon&#x27;s Magic Roundabout. It&#x27;s a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I&#x27;m not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London&#x27;s equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham&#x27;s Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It&#x27;s the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you&#x27;ll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there&#x27;s one challenge that&#x27;s truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

                    <span>About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.

Honestly, it looks quite good.

The low admission fee of zero pounds was announced at The Game Awards, which is a pretty good deal if you’re looking to participate in a battle royale that’s still very much alive and kicking. Players can also pay for Battlegrounds Plus, an account upgrade that’ll net you some extra in-game unlocks. And don&#x27;t worry, if you already own the game you&#x27;ll get that upgrade for free.

                    <span>Praise be to Geoff and all the Keighleys! Tunic, that indie Zelda-like with a fox that you sort of thought was probably already out until I just told you it isn&#x27;t yet, finally has a release date! As announced during The Game Awards last night, we can expect it to arrive on March 16th, 2022.
We&#x27;ve been hearing about Tunic for literal years now, and its omnipresence at showcases and announceathons like The Game Awards has kept it on everyone&#x27;s radar the whole time. Feast your eyes on what will hopefully be one of the last trailers for it, until the happy day we post about a launch trailer.

                    <span>I am not great at keeping my mind palace organised. I don&#x27;t even have a mind palace. If my mind were any kind of structure it would be a Lego creative box of randomly mixed bricks. Thus, like an advanced robot, I store my memory outside my body in the form of daily to-do lists that I write up every morning. Wytchwood is a to-do list game, with each item cascading into a sub-list of more things to be ticked off. The difference is, in real life, my daily to-do list only includes &#x27;make shiny lure to catch an elf and steal its shoes&#x27; on Tuesdays.

                    <span>Remember Saints Row? It&#x27;s back, in trailer form. After Volition&#x27;s reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night&#x27;s Game Awards.
The trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it&#x27;s technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game. Check out the trailer below to agree with me.

                    <span>Shortly after Telltale Games announced a game based on The Expanse at The Game Awards tonight, a group of former Telltale employees announced they too were boldly going into an interactive sci-fi story based on a TV show. New studio Dramatic Labs announced Star Trek: Resurgence, a Telltale-style game about choosing your own adventure in the world of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo. It looks hella Telltale, and they even have the digital corpse of Leonard Nimoy. But man, the Star Trek story I crave would be about downtime, not action.

                    <span>Here he comes, that speedy blue boy. Where will he go? Who knows! He can run around in an open world now, no longer restrained by specific paths which cause him to inexplicably die when he steps a toe off of them. I am, of course, talking about the newly announced Sonic Frontiers. The next 3D Sonic game is set to arrive late 2022, and we got our first glimpse of it at The Game Awards tonight.

                    <span>Forspoken, a game whose name I will never pronounce correctly but was once known as Project Athia, finally has a concrete release date. Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix&#x27;s big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as &#x27;spring&#x27; and therefore doesn&#x27;t constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there&#x27;s a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.

                    <span>Honestly, I&#x27;ve no interest in Wonder Woman. Warner Bros announcing an open-world Wonder Woman game at The Game Awards tonight meant nothing to me at first. My interest was piqued when I saw it&#x27;s being made by Monolith, the studio behind F.E.A.R. and the Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor series. Then I saw OH WAIT it&#x27;s using that wonderful patented Nemesis System which breathes personality and history into enemies? I&#x27;m in. Fully. Let&#x27;s go.

                    <span>I almost missed the trailer for Arc Raiders during The Game Awards, but quickly found the tab it was playing in as soon as I heard Robyn&#x27;s Dancing On My Own. What a fab tune for a game trailer! Arc Raiders looks alright - it&#x27;s a free-to-play third-person shooter in which you and a squad of mates fight evil robots, and it&#x27;s coming out in 2022. Check out the vid below (if only to listen to a proper bop).

It&#x27;s out on March 3rd 2022, and its new Game Awards trailer certainly shows a much more vivid and eye-catching game than the one Ed and I saw in the most recent closed beta. Not only are there giant skull bosses with lasers bursting out of their eye sockets, but some of the creatures you&#x27;ll face in the Tower Of Babylon look suspiciously like Nier: Automata-style bullet-hell boys. See it all in action below.

It first arrived in early access two years ago, and has had loads of update adding new weapons and environments since. With today&#x27;s 1.0 launch, it adds even more content too, including new environments, tools, bots, checkpoints and more. That&#x27;s my weekend plans sorted.

                    <span>A new Elden Ring trailer fresh out The Game Awards introduces the story of the new game from Dark Souls developers FromSoftware and Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. Well, I say it introduces the story, I mean it does it in a very Souls way, reeling off names like &quot;the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed&quot; without explaining anything. This seems like it would be the game&#x27;s opening cinematic so if you watch this trailer now, hey, it&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re starting Elden Ring two months early. Almost.

Spoice Mahreen was a lovely wee stompy hack-and-slash game, capturing the chunky feeling and ultraviolence of futurefascists in a way no other 40K game had. Ultramarine boy Captain Titus will return, this time cutting into the Tyranid hordes. Check out the announcement trailer.

I attended a hands-off preview, and it sure does look like a cartoony battle royale. The most standout thing to me was that you could put an entire cooked chicken in your pocket, or throw it at someone, so that&#x27;s something.

                    <span>After multiple delays, Cuphead - The Delicious Last Course finally has a release date. The expansion for Studio MDHR&#x27;s 1930s cartoon-inspired platformer comes out on June 30th, 2022, and adds a new character to play and a bunch of new bosses to die to over and over again. You can see some of the newbies in the new trailer below from this evening&#x27;s Game Awards, including a spooky witch and a donkey (mule? horse?) in shining armour.

                    <span>Heavy Rain developers Quantic Dream and Lucasfilm Games are making Star Wars: Eclipse, an action-adventure game set in the &quot;golden age of the Jedi&quot;. It was announced at The Game Awards with a rather dramatic trailer featuring an alien playing some drums, adorable green monkeys in a market, lotsa space ships, and of course, plenty of shiny lightsaber shots. The rumours were true, then.

                    <span>Poor Saltzpyre has been waiting so patiently while all the other characters in Fatshark&#x27;s Warhammer: Vermintide 2  have received their snazzy new classes over the last year or so, but his wait is finally over. During The Game Awards, the developers announced Saltzpyre players will be able to become the Warrior Priest of Sigmar today, wielding a chunky, glowing hammer for some close-quarters action. He also has new armour that&#x27;s covered in skulls, which looks very edgy indeed.

                    <span>After needing seven years and several failed starts to successfully launch a game of their own, Amazon Game Studios are perhaps cautiously turning to other developers for their next. Today they announced a release date of February 11th for Lost Ark, the Diablo-y action-RPG first released by Smilegate in South Korea in 2019, which Amazon will publish in Europe and the Americas. Might be alright? It&#x27;ll free-to-play, anyway. Check out the new trailer from The Game Awards below.

Just like that. Next Thursday, the 16th of December, FF7 Remake will hit PC in its expanded Intergrade form. Like many other recent Square Enix RPG ports (and as expected), it will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store.

Alan Wake 2 is coming in 2023, and this time Remedy say it will be a survival horror game, not an action game. Also, Alan looks a bit like Jake Gyllenhaal now? Check out the trailer below.

But it was back at The Game Awards again this year, showing some brand new footage of Senua leading a group of fighters through a rather wet cave to face a giant. It looks fantastic, and incredibly eerie.

Helping out on development are Deck Nine Games, the studio behind Life Is Strange: True Colors. Check out the trailer below.

Published by Annapurna Interactive, it looks eccentric and colourful, with battles involve throwing ghostly cars and calling in giant family members to swat your opponents. It also features cooking, skateboarding, and possibly dancing (though I can&#x27;t quite tell from the trailer if the dancing is separate from the battling).

Sticking with naming conventions, it&#x27;s unsurprisingly called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It&#x27;ll be based on the film that came out in 1974, and the teaser trailer revealed at The Game Awards features a delightful creepy shot of leatherface.

A new &quot;gameplay&quot; trailer arrived today during the Game Awards pre-show today and yes: absolutely the spaceships still leave those pretty engine trails behind them. The trailer also gives neat-o peeks at spacebattles raging through the ruins of derelict megastructures. See for yourself below.

                    <span>The two latest games to be offered free to keep from the Epic Games Store couldn&#x27;t be more different. In one corner, the grim management sim Prison Architect, in which you carefully house and profit from criminals. In the other corner, Godfall, an ARPG looter-shooter about looking fabulous and smashing monsters to bits.

                    <span>Yesterday, Ubisoft announced their intention to bring the first NFTs to their games in the form of three cosmetic items for Ghost Recon Breakpoint. As part of the announcement they produced a 79 second trailer describing how the system, dubbed &quot;Ubisoft Quartz&quot;, would work.

After around 24 hours, the video has 200k views, 1300+ likes and 35,000+ dislikes.

Now its final content update makes it more accessible to modders, including removing limits on the number of cultures, building types and factions.

                    <span>Maybe games just look like this now? S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is an Unreal Engine 5 game, so it&#x27;s bound to be pretty. Yet I look at the new screenshots its developers posted to Twitter, and they look to me less like screenshots than the painted-over bullshots of yore. See them below and make up your own mind.

                    <span>This Is The President is a game that, partway through, had me worried it wouldn&#x27;t really qualify as a strategy game. As you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s about being the US President, and making lots of decisions about running the country and trying not to become too unpopular. But it&#x27;s far closer to interactive fiction than a simulation, with a main plot whose demands, if failed, will instantly end the game.
It has, however, got me considering what exactly &quot;political strategy game&quot; means.

                    <span>Halo Infinite is now out and playable in its entirety, following a weirdly chopped-up release process that culminated in me having to run three different downloads just to play the campaign. But anyway! Now seems like a good time to take a closer look at Infinite’s PC system requirements, and which graphics settings you should tweak to get the best performance.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not normally a fan of children in games because, as noted in this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, they get into the uncanny valley pretty quickly. But it&#x27;s the season to be jolly, so we&#x27;re talking about the times we thing kids in games are actually really good.
We do end up going on quite a lot of tangents, notably one on which Warhammer faction Matthew would play, and of course we ask Matthew for his thoughts on Mr. Beast&#x27;s Squid Game. This week&#x27;s Cavern Of Lies is in Nate&#x27;s control, which means he takes us to Dwarf Fortress, with predictable results.

Here, come watch the trailer to meet some of the new monsters, including a giant snake. No room for subtlety here.

The employee, named Christine, spoke about her firsthand experiences of misconduct and retaliation while working at the company for the last four years, claiming she experienced inappropriate touching, unwanted sexual advances, and &quot;a frat boy culture that&#x27;s detrimental to women&quot;.

But don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll still find plenty of older free games that are worth just as much of your time as they new-uns.
Our picks below include both free and free-to-play games. Anything with a mandatory cost is excluded, as are mods or anything dependent on another purchase. The result is a list of games that run the gamut, from ARPGs to management, 2D platformers to co-op first-person shooters. 
If you&#x27;d prefer to consume a version of this list via the magic of moving pictures, you can do so with this handy video we&#x27;ve put together:

While it’s not as hefty as previous updates, it’s still full of tweaks. And that’s good, because this game could use them. Expect your bullets to find their targets a bit better, various audio improvements, and rooftop objective removals from the Breakthrough mode.

                    <span>After a crazy summer that saw Final Fantasy XIV’s playerbase expand dramatically during what was supposed to be a quiet period, it’s no surprise that anyone wanting to tuck into the new Endwalker expansion has a lot of queueing to do. But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you’re in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.
Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It’s huge. So huge that it’s going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.

                    <span>Amazon ve středu oznámil, že plánuje vypnout svůj globální systém hodnocení webových stránek a nástroj pro analýzu konkurentů Alexa.com, který na internetu běží už 25 let. Platforma bude vypnuta 1. května 2022. Před 25 lety jsme založili Alexa Internet. Po dvou desetiletích, kdy jsme vám pomáhali najít, oslovit a převést vaše digitální publikum, jsme učinili těžké rozhodnutí, že 1. května 2022 ukončíme provoz Alexa.com, píše se v krátkém oznámení.</span>

                    <span>The next patch for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is a big one: 78GB big. Ubisoft today announced that next week&#x27;s patch &quot;will &quot;will require players to re-download the entire game as part of a data restructuring.&quot; The whole base game, downloaded all over again. It&#x27;s for a good cause, at least. This should make the game load faster and generally run better, which is a nice change for a game to still have the motivation to deliver a year after launch, but maybe not such welcome news if you&#x27;re on a slow, throttled, or metered connection.

                    <span>While some Chaos gods have perfectly reasonable cover stories for their interests in pursuits like decay and mutation or murder and mutilation (I mean, one can hardly get skulls for one&#x27;s skull throne at Ikea), Slaneesh is unashamedly &#x27;horny on main&#x27; (as middle-aged people like me believe young people might still say, possibly?). This much is clear in a new trailer which introduces the Slaneesh of Total War: Warhammer 3, clad in hot pinks and meat lingerie.
