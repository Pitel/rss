It&#x27;s been another exciting week for Digimon fans - with Bandai Namco confirming it would be bringing Digimon World: Next Order to the Nintendo Switch on 22nd February 2023.
If this wasn&#x27;t already enough, Digimon producer Kazumasu Habu has also confirmed in the original Japanese announcement that the Digimon team was working on multiple other Digimon projects. This might not necessarily be a surprise, but it&#x27;s certainly nice to know!

Hi folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time, we took a look at the fourth entry in Capcom&#x27;s Mega Man franchise: Mega Man 4 for the NES. It wasn&#x27;t a close one, either; far from it!

Currently there are accelerator drivers living within the catch-all &quot;char/misc&quot; area of the kernel while some driver efforts have been focused on Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem integration given the commonality with GPUs and some of the core infrastructure and APIs being relevant for both GPUs and these dedicated accelerator ASICs. There finally seems to be some agreement over the future of the accelerator subsystem and some initial patches were mailed out this weekend...</span>

The IFS driver and associated hardware capability is for detecting potential problems not caught by parity or ECC checks on systems in production. In-Field Scan was merged in Linux 5.19 but then shortly thereafter the driver was marked &quot;broken&quot; due to some driver design issues coming to light. New patches for IFS have been posted to improve the driver&#x27;s design and remove that &quot;broken&quot; tag...</span>

Good morning, friends, and welcome to this week&#x27;s Whatcha Been Playing? You find me, nay, us, at a strange crossroads in the long and winding road of Destructoid. As you may have heard — and indeed, read — Jordan Devore has finally decided the time is right to disembark, having been on-board for an amazing 15 years. While Destructoid is going through some major changes, this was not the reason for Devore&#x27;s exodus... He simply believed the door was open and the time was right. I agreed with his hypothesis, and I know that he already has some exciting life prospects and plans ahead, and he is taking the right steps to ensure that he can make the most of them.
I mean, he&#x27;s going to the coast today. Am I going to the coast today? No. So there&#x27;s one example.
Regardless, Jordan w…</span>

No matter how much space I have to process it all, this was never going to be easy to write. After more than 15 years and 15,000 posts, my time at Destructoid — a blog I joined while I was still just a teenager! — has come to an end.
It&#x27;s been a wild ride since the day Niero randomly took a chance on me, and I&#x27;m proud of what the team has accomplished, and will accomplish.
Deep down, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be here &quot;forever&quot; — but I also knew that I wouldn&#x27;t really want to do this job anywhere else. I didn&#x27;t just want to write about games; I wanted to write about games on Destructoid. On the internet, there&#x27;s no shortage of places to call home. This one&#x27;s been mine for a long time, and it has become an unshakable part of my identity.

                              <span>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo&#x27;s portable console
Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. Record of Agarest War is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It&#x27;s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.
You can check out the trailer here:

No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.
Generations of war
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Record of Agarest War, it&#x27;s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.
But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero&#x27;s stats and aspects of their appearance.
So yes, fans of Fire Emblem: Awakening&#x27;s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as Agarest War has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both new titles and remasters of old classics. It looks like Aksys wasn&#x27;t going to let Agarest War sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.
The news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement stream, alongside several other game announcements. Cuddly Forest Friends is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery heads to Switch in summer 2023, and Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- is set for Switch in 2024.

                              <span>&quot;This update will be smaller than some of our larger updates that bring new content into the game&quot;
A Fallout 76 Halloween event is happening very soon, and it&#x27;ll be ushered in by a &quot;smaller&quot; update to boot.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from Bethesda:
&quot;Tuesday, October 25th we are planning on releasing a new update to Fallout 76. This update will be smaller than some of our larger updates that bring new content into the game. With this update, we’re bringing new items into the Atomic Shop to release over the coming weeks, addressing a number of bugs, and kicking off a brand-new Challenge event for the 25th Anniversary. We are currently looking to begin maintenance for Fallout 76 at 10:00 a.m. ET on October 25. We will be sure to share update with you in the Bethesda Studios Discord and the Fallout Twitter so that you know precisely when you can log back in. Starting October 25, you can hunt down costumed Scorched throughout Appalachia to loot Mystery Candy, Spooky Treat Bags, and of course, legendary items. Track down Scorched at their usual haunts, keep an ear out for their spine-tingling sounds, and you’re bound to find at least a few who are dressed up for Halloween.&quot;

It&#x27;s been a busy month for Fallout 76 amid the 25th anniversary celebration, and the game just hosted the Invaders from Beyond seasonal event, which ended on October 18. Currently the team is going from event to event: and even if some of them are on repeat at this point, there is some movement beyond the mega-patches.
We&#x27;ll have to wait until the day-of most likely to see what this &quot;smaller&quot; patch actually entails, but suffice to say like most of the micro-updates, they&#x27;ll involve tons of bug fixes: some of which address issues that have been lingering for a while, or crept up in the patch before it.

Something very special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter Angel Eyes!
Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, Angel Eyes — or to give it its full title Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant &quot;ojou&quot; woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (predating Enchantress by several decades), fight it out in cute &#x27;n&#x27; colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally stra…</span>

                              <span>Fans of the Resident Evil 4 dog known as Hewie wil never forgive you, Capcom
Resident Evil 4 is known as one of the most iconic games of all time. It&#x27;s got stylized gameplay, it&#x27;s got quippy one-liners, and it&#x27;s got a sexy protagonist in the form of Leon Kennedy. Fans of Resident Evil 4 love every frame of that game, so naturally, they&#x27;ve been closely analyzing any footage of the highly anticipated remake until its release in March of next year. One of the most famous details that players encounter early on in the game&#x27;s story is a dog stuck in a bear trap in the woods. Players have the option of either leaving the dog, killing it, or setting it free -- naturally you can imagine which option became the most popular.
IGN reviewed some shocking new footage of the Resident Evil 4 remake, however, and staunch dog-releasers are not going to be too thrilled about what they see. The video shows the player walking the familiar route through the woods, only to find that the dog has already been killed, in a really gruesome way, I might add. It&#x27;s pretty upsetting stuff to see by any standard, but knowing that dog has so many fans (who have affectionately named him Hewie) makes it all that much harder to stomach.

While this certainly looks like it&#x27;s in the Resident Evil 4 remake in some capacity, I&#x27;m of the belief that you&#x27;re still able to save the dog after all, and this video is a ploy to get more buzz about the game. Maybe I&#x27;m just in denial, but I have a hard time believing that Capcom would intentionally leave out one of the most beloved details of their entire game. If it is the case that we won&#x27;t see Hewie alive again, at least it makes the experience of having saved him in the original game all the more special.

Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was a fun surprise, mixing together some unexpected ingredients in Mario, Rabbids, and strategy for a good strategy game. And Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn&#x27;t just repeat; it builds up into a delightful experience that feels all its own.
Sparks of Hope initially follows a similar formula to Kingdom Battle. Mario, Luigi, and Peach are hanging out with their Rabbid counterparts and floating helper Beep-O when a giant space monster attacks. The gang finds out that galaxy&#x27;s at stake, as the evil Cursa is converting minions to her side to gain control of hybrid Rabbid-Luma creatures called Sparks.
The team sets off, with some new tactics and weapons in tow. Those six, alongside newcomer Edge, Bowser, and Rabbid Rosalina, form the Spark…</span>

                              <span>Should we all be worried, or is it just a fad?
If you&#x27;ve had your ear to the ground for the past couple of years, you&#x27;ll have heard at least some of the rumbles of debate over the ethics and impact of AI art. You may have even heard the names of some tools used to create AI art, like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E. But you may also be wondering why these tools have spawned such strong opinions in the news, on social media, and even among people you know. After all, haven&#x27;t we been having the &quot;robots will take our jobs&quot; discussion for decades, now?
The hook behind these publically-available AI tools is that they can take wildly specific prompts and unflinchingly depict them, like an artist working on commission that doesn&#x27;t care if you want a lifesize painting of Mario and Luigi eating a barbecued Toad, just as long as they get paid. Except, of course, many of these tools do it for free. Many people are using tools like DALL-E to generate memeable images on social media, but others saw the commercial potential behind AI tools, and it wasn&#x27;t long before an artist entered a piece of AI-generated art (using Midjourney) into a competition — and won, causing outrage and concern for the art industry.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, on its 15-year anniversary, Jim pleads the case for a forgotten Wii classic...

If there’s one thing that you could always rely on the Wii to achieve, it was family-friendly multiplayer. Gone were the days of explaining to an elderly relative what various triggers and button combinations did, instead it was a case of swapping out your grandma’s sherry with a plastic white rectangle, standing her in front of the screen watching her beat seven shades of hoo-ha out of an animated opponent in the boxing ring.

There were quite a lot of Mario games released during the Game Boy Advance series like Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga, but one series we never saw on Nintendo&#x27;s 32-bit handheld hardware was Paper Mario.

Wow. This week has been so full of news, we would be hesitant to add any more for fear of bursting. After long anticipating the releases of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Persona 5 Royal on the Switch, who would have thought that Bayonetta 3 drama would overshadow it all? Hey, welcome to the world of Nintendo!
Aside from keeping all of you lovely readers up to date with all of the twists and turns in the aforementioned voice acting dispute, we have been busy ranking every Mario Party title ahead of the first two games&#x27; release on the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack next month, and breaking all of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s new &#x27;mons into tiers (completely factual and objective, of course).

Today, at a big digital showcase, Capcom showed off a bunch of new gameplay footage of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. And while a lot of classic moments and characters are coming back…

With every bit of new info we get on Callisto Protocol, the more excited I am to try it out. Despite being a complete scaredy cat, I&#x27;m excited to try it out with its stealth mechanics, action-packed gunfights, and the overall promise of a creepy sci-fi adventure a la Dead Space. Callisto Protocol is now only a few months away from its release date on December 2, and the developers at Striking Distance Studios have announced that the game is ready for players to enjoy. The game has officially gone gold!
Callisto Protocol is the upcoming space horror action game from Glen Schofield, a game dev veteran who has worked on titles like Call of Duty and, of course, Dead Space. It can be scary to branch off and start a new indie studio, but f…</span>

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival Switch just hit the scene, and as a long time Taiko no Tatsujin player, I couldn&#x27;t resist.
At first glance, Rhythm Festival doesn&#x27;t offer a ton of bells and whistles. The &quot;story mode&quot; really is propelled by a points/rank-up system, which provides you with additional kernels of dialogue with our hero, Don-Chan, and their relationship with other adorable characters. It&#x27;s extremely cute, and although it meanders a bit, it has a lot of heart to keep people interested: especially when it comes to families playing it together (which is what we did in our household).
As usual, your job is to drum two core notes (red and blue, or don and ka respectively): which are denoted by inside and outside drumming on an actual drum set peripheral. I mentioned the …</span>

                              <span>A who&#x27;s who of survival horror
As part of yesterday evening&#x27;s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that it would be holding a short early access test session for its delayed multiplayer title Resident Evil Re: Verse. The beta will take place between Sunday, October 23, and Tuesday, October 25 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One platforms.
The purpose of this short beta is to test the crossplay capabilities of the multiplayer shooter ahead of its release on October 28 — cutting it a bit close, perhaps, but nevertheless. Anyone with a copy of Resident Evil Village can participate in the beta, all you need do is download the client from the store of your choosing and you&#x27;ll be ready to rock once the switches are flicked on the servers. Boom schlack-lack.

Originally intended to launch as the multiplayer component of Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse has been repeatedly delayed as the developer worked to stabilize the build and its contents. The multiplayer game — essentially an evolution of the popular &quot;Mercenaries&quot; mode — will see a legacy of familiar stars from the Resident Evil franchise fighting it out in a series of modes set against the backdrop of some familiar locales.
In addition to the last-minute beta, Capcom also offered up initial details for Re:Verse&#x27;s post-launch content. Launching with six &quot;Survivors&quot;, five &quot;Creatures&quot;, two stages, a challenge mission, and a 30-level battle pass, Resident Evil Re:Verse will receive several initial updates, each adding more characters, stages, costumes, missions, and modes. There are currently three updates planned post-launch, but dates and details were not forthcoming.
Resident Evil Re:Verse launches October 28 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

                              <span>More digital monsters are on the way
There&#x27;s more in store for the world of digital monsters. Digimon game producers Kazumasa Habu and Takahiro Yokota confirm that &quot;multiple&quot; Digimon game projects are in the works.
The news arrives alongside the confirmation that Digimon World: Next Order is getting ported to the PC and Switch. In a video from the duo, they confirm that there&#x27;s more in store for Digimon.
&quot;Currently, we have multiple Digimon game projects in the pipeline,&quot; said Habu. &quot;And Digimon World: Next Order is actually handled by a new producer that joined the Digimon game team this year.&quot;
https://twitter.com/digimon_games/status/1583141278513889281
No details on what those projects are yet. As for Digimon World: Next Order, the 2017 game is getting some quality-of-life features for its PC and Switch port.
One addition is a &quot;Beginner Mode&quot; difficulty setting. Alongside that, the Digimon team is also adding a run option. Finally, some cardio in the digital world.
Digimon World: Next Order will hit PC and Nintendo Switch on February 22, 2023.

Digital champions
There&#x27;s been a few Digimon games steadily trickling out, including one this year. Digimon Survive finally launched this last July, after a series of delays.
And before that, the frequently praised Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth made its way to Nintendo Switch and PC.
Now, Next Order is next up on the docket and more projects are potentially on the way. Although we don&#x27;t have any details, this still seems like good news for Digimon fans who have been holding out for more from the franchise.

Digital retailer Epic Games Store has revealed the two new titles that it will be offering up to all users free-of-charge next week — Come October 27, we will be getting a little creep, and a little carnage, with the arrival of horror adventure Saturnalia and tabletop strategy sim Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;v1qGfWjlv8s
Making its grand debut on October 27, Saturnalia is a mood-piece horror title developed by Italian studio Santa Ragione and encapsulating the country&#x27;s love of oppressive, colorful, and unnerving tales of the macabre. This roguelike adventure will see the player control an ensemble cast of characters, who find themselves trapped within a labyrinthine village under the power of some ancient, otherworldly evil.

                              <span>Most of you won&#x27;t even notice
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 patch 1.2 is out today, and some sleuths have noticed a cosmetic change with a story beat, amid the vague patch notes provided by Nintendo.
As spotted by Noisy pixel thanks to a bunch of Xenoblade players on Twitter, a story character had their weapon altered to (depending on your view) better fit the story. Suffice to say I&#x27;ll be as mysterious as possible to avoid any spoilers, but the model of a sword was changed. As Noisy Pixel points out, most people who already cleared the game won&#x27;t even notice, and even if you replayed it in its entirety this weekend, you may not even spot the difference off-hand.
Curiously, this was not mentioned in the patch notes anywhere. Here&#x27;s the entirety of the version 1.2 notes:
&quot;We&#x27;ve fixed some issues to make the game more enjoyable.&quot;

Well then!
This is coming right off of a major expansion pass update, which is the first real content drop Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has gotten since launch. The first part of the pass mainly involved some cosmetic extras and items, but now we have characters in the mix. That character/challenge drop pattern is set to repeat again in 2023 (April 30 to be exact), followed by the meat of the pass: an expansion.

Somehow, despite all my bellyaching, I got roped back into Overwatch. I used to play pretty seriously with a team when I was in college, but I thought I was done with the game for good until Overwatch 2 came out (even if it doesn&#x27;t really count as a sequel in my book). The game is still full of bugs, but I&#x27;ve mostly been able to enjoy my experience because I&#x27;m trying out all kinds of new heroes I never thought I could viably play in the past.
I used to be basically just a one-trick Mercy main, but now I&#x27;ve found I can viably play the entire support roster, as well as a number of tanks and DPS characters. I&#x27;ll thank my extensive Call of Duty training for that. The problem is, though, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of opportunities to try out my new skills in competitive m…</span>

Early access will be available on PC through Steam, the Epic Game Store, and other digital storefronts. Development will continue, as Intercept Games keeps working on features and tuning in the months after launch.
To showcase all this, Intercept released a lengthy developer update today, announcing the news and detailing what&#x27;s in store for the early access launch.

A game developer has expressed their frustration with Xbox&#x27;s mandatory declaration that all Xbox Series X games must also run on its lesser-powered pal, Xbox Series S — Noting that the requirement can be, and frequently is, a hindrance to the forward progression of next-gen gaming.
As reported by VGC, these comments were made by Bossa Studios&#x27; VFX developer Ian McClure, speaking in a conversation on Twitter with Giant Bomb founder Jeff Gerstmann. Gerstmann had previously commented that the Xbox Series X/S &quot;forced compatibility&quot; was unlikely to be preventing forward momentum of development within the industry — the latter being a commonly referenced talking point by many gaming communities, regardless of their platform of choice.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a keychain for 400 Platinum
My Nintendo has been on a roll with first party goodies, as a Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope reward just arrived on the service.
Clocking in at 2&quot; x 1 3/4&quot; x 1/16&quot; dimension-wise, it&#x27;s a pretty standard keychain that&#x27;s inline with a lot of prior My Nintendo offerings. It features the likeness of Spark from Sparks of Hope, and it&#x27;ll run you 400 Platinum Points. While I&#x27;m generally not big on the Rabbids themselves, this version of Spark is really cute.
The Spark keychain follows suit with an effort to release at least one item on My Nintendo that ties into a first party game (or in this case, a game that deals with first party properties).  Recent tie-ins include a Splatoon 3 bag and sticker set, a Mario Strikers bag, and a Switch Sports cooling towel. All of the above are still available at the moment at the time of publication.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

During yesterday&#x27;s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom offered up release dates for cloud editions of several &quot;modern classics&quot; that currently winging their way to the humble Nintendo Switch platform.
The four titles pulled from the modern canon of the survival horror series consist of 2021&#x27;s Resident Evil Village, the 2019 Resident Evil 2 remake, the 2020 Resident Evil 3 remake, and the iconic Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, which literally reshaped the entire franchise following its launch in 2017. These cloud editions will see the games streamed directly to the Switch platform, allowing Nintendo&#x27;s plucky hybrid console to depict the top-tier visuals and intense action of each respective horror show.

The action kicks off with Resident Evil Village on October 28. Resident Evil 2 will then launch November 11, with Resident Evil 3 following a week later on November 18, and finally rounded out with Resident Evil VII: Biohazard on December 16. That&#x27;s hours upon hours of top-tier goo-filled action to keep you warm during those cold winter nights. All three titles are well worth your time and effort, and these new cloud editions will open up their creepy worlds to a new audience of players... You should play it in bed, under the covers. Oooooo... Spooky.
Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil VII: Biohazard are all available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. In related news, be sure to check out the exciting new trailer for the highly anticipated remake Resident Evil 4.

                              <span>Anytime Bloodborne is mentioned, an angel flies across the sky at 60 FPS
Any day, another ill-advised tweet: though this one is incredibly tame compared to some of the things we&#x27;ve seen these past few years. Sony threw out a rather harmless tweet asking people to identify (an obvious) Bloodborne cover, and that was apparently it. After a riotous response, Sony deleted it.
https://twitter.com/evanf1997_/status/1583143932237844481
Here&#x27;s what the tweet said:
&quot;Can you see it: which PlayStation game cover are we zooming in on?&quot;

Yep, it was Bloodborne. It was even trending!
But as Twitter gaming pundit Nibellion points out, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing something like this unless you have news to back it up. Sure, having a bit of fun with some games and such can work (Nintendo does it on their YouTube channel), but Twitter? That&#x27;s just opening yourself up to a sea of roasting.
Fans have been asking for an FPS upgrade patch for PS5 for years, and/or some form of a remaster. The action game, which demands a lot of its players on a technical level, is still locked to 30 FPS, much to the chagrin of most of its playerbase. Some would argue that it&#x27;s the only glaring flaw left for the project, which has to be rectified at some point. Bloodborne is the kind of game many will be playing for decades, and From Software is no stranger to returning to their old catalog.
For now, it&#x27;s the status quo. And a lesson learned!

                              <span>There&#x27;s My Nintendo Splatoon 3 Pokemon rewards involved
A Pokemon Splatfest is imminent, but until then, Japan is going all-out with their celebrations for the milestone event: which includes swag, and Pokemon center participation (as well as a few other locations listed below).
First up, Nintendo is offering keychains for Platinum Points (for My Nintendo Japan), including SKUs for each of the Splatfest choices: grass, fire, and water. They actually resemble the patterns of the t-shirts that will appear in-game, which is a nice touch.
A &quot;Collaboration Festival&quot; is also underway at Pokemon Centers &quot;nationwide&quot; (again, in Japan), where you can pick up tie-in stickers (featuring the key art for the event). Curiously, some centers also have &quot;polling stations,&quot; which include &quot;voting stickers&quot; for each choice.
As a reminder, everything will kick off on November 11 at 4PM PT, through November 13 at that same time. The Pokemon Center tie-ins begin on October 21, and will run through November 13 (or, as Nintendo points out, as long as supplies last).
Here&#x27;s a list of the Japanese locations hosting Pokemon Splatfest events:
Bic Camera Sapporo (Hokkaido)
Bic Camera Yurakucho (Tokyo)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Akiba (Tokyo)
Bic Camera Lazona Kawasaki (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Yokohama (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Umeda (Osaka)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Hakata (Fukuoka)
&quot;All Pokemon Center stores&quot;
[Update: The US My Nintendo site has been updated, and confirms that the trio of keychains are &quot;coming soon&quot; to the US side.]

Nintendo revealed the next N64 classics that will be joining the Nintendo Switch Online archive of retrotastic releases — And it&#x27;s none other than colorful and incredibly nostalgic digital board games Mario Party and Mario Party 2. The two titles will be available to subscribers from November 2.
Developed by Hudson Soft and released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, Mario Party and Mario Party 2 were Nintendo&#x27;s hugely successful efforts to transpose the beloved Super Mario Bros. universe to a &quot;tabletop&quot; format, with players chasing each other around a digital board game, and battling it out in fun, short, silly, and simplistic mini-games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;meP0WTgUJcE
Focusing on basic controls, easy-to-learn rules, and fast action, Mario Party can be seen as one of Nintendo&#x27;s earliest forays into the &quot;anyone can play&quot; demography. This inclusive view of the family gaming audience would lead to the development and staggering success of the Nintendo Wii platform.
Since those halcyon years, the franchise has continued on successive platforms including the Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, and, most recently, the Nintendo Switch in the form of 2021&#x27;s Mario Party Superstars. While the visuals and creativity have obviously progressed with each and every entry, the series has never lost sight of its inclusive nature, still offering pick-up-and-play fun for both dedicated video game fans, and visiting holiday relatives. With these Nintendo Switch Online re-releases, series fans who missed out on the franchise&#x27;s formative days can jump back into the action all over again.
Bagsy Peach.
Mario Party and Mario Party 2 join the Nintendo Switch Online archives on November 2.

                              <span>Which Witch?
PlatinumGames has finally broken its silence on the ugly Bayonetta 3 voice actor controversy that has been the height of internet discourse for the past week — In a new statement posted to Twitter, the studio reaffirmed its solidarity with actor Jennifer Hale, who will portray the gunslinging witch in the new sequel, which hits the shelves next week after years of anticipation.
The incredibly straight statement, presented unemotionally and sparsely worded as if it has been passed through several legal departments, outlines Platinum&#x27;s desire to continue forward with Hale as the &quot;new Bayonetta&quot;, while thanking all those who have contributed to the franchise&#x27;s past success, (though choosing not to reference anybody in particular by name.)

The latest Resident Evil Showcase spotlighted what&#x27;s to come for the series. And the Resident Evil 4 remake is looking especially good in the extended gameplay shown off today.
Capcom showed a good chunk of the early portions of Resident Evil 4. It&#x27;s moody and dark at times, but still has that bit of action hero charm to it.
We get a look at one of the game&#x27;s more memorable early sections: the village, where Leon and the player end up scrambling through houses, fleeing villagers and a chainsaw-wielding foe.

Alongside all the action, there are some familiar faces that pop up too. Ada, Ashley, Luis, and Salazar all look great in their new, remade versions. The Merchant is still around to sell some wares, too.
It&#x27;s not…</span>

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication. 
Check out the new Resident Evil 4 remake trailer for yourself below:

Bayonetta 3 developer Platinum Games, the studio former Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor accused of low-balling with &quot;immoral&quot; compensation (which has since been disputed by Bloomberg reporting – see original story below), has responded to the ongoing voice actor controversy surrounding its game. The studio does not directly address any claims made by Taylor, instead opting to voice its support of new Bayonetta voice actor and Taylor&#x27;s replacement, Jennifer Hale.

                              <span>Three decades since his Super Mario Land 2 debut.
30 years ago, we clutched our Game Boys in our sweaty palms and gasped in collective awe at the majesty we were faced with when Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins dropped on the scene. Not only did we have an absolute banger in our hands — completely outdoing the first Mario Land in every respect and feeling like a &#x27;proper&#x27; Super Mario Bros. game magically squeezed into the old Boy — but it was also the first time we got to bask in the glory of Wario. In his debut appearance, Mario’s rival was a sneaky yet imposing figure, towering over him.
Fast forward three decades (yes, really) and the Wario we know now is a fair bit different than that hulking menace we first saw in 1992. Wario now resides mostly in the comedy jobber region, occasionally being trotted out as a side-antagonist in Mario Sports games. But where was the turning point?

                              <span>We have something important to tell you.
Not so long ago, we brought you the NL verdict on Alan Wake Remastered, the long-rumoured port of last year&#x27;s PS5, Xbox Series, and PC rerelease of Alan Wake. And it&#x27;s still a classic, for sure, but there are some rough edges to be found in this version of the game.
To show you what we mean, we&#x27;ve managed to capture 15 minutes of the game for you lovely lot. We don&#x27;t want to discourage you — this is still a worthy port for those who&#x27;ve never experienced the game and who don&#x27;t have access to other consoles. And playing Alan Wake in bed with a mug of tea sounds like a lovely Halloween treat. But just how much does the visual downgrade affect the overall atmosphere?

We&#x27;re suckers for pieces of decorative plastic here at Nintendo Life, so when the chance came to place an order for Good Smile&#x27;s Zelda Skyward Sword 1/7 scale Link statue, we couldn&#x27;t reach for the keyboard quickly enough.
Our statue has actually been to and from Hong Kong twice since we purchased it, due to our local shipping firm getting the address wrong and returning it to sender – but we have to admit, the wait was still worth it.

Pokémon Sword and Shield has begun what could be its final Max Raid Battle event, with Glastrier and Spectrier headlining the roster that you can face. The event runs from today until 23rd October, 2022, so you&#x27;ll have to act fast to get involved.
The two legendary Pokémon will not be catchable during the battles, but this does not mean that the Max Raid is not worth your time. Instead of getting leaving with a brand new &#x27;mon in tow, the rewards for completing the battle range across a series of valuable items including Ability Capsules, rare Berries (Custap, Enigma, Jaboca, Micle, Rowap) and Bottle Caps (standard and gold).

Chapter 1 - An Overdue Return
In the pleasant, reasonably well-kept living room of my small, comfortable home, I sat down on the sofa with a warming mug of strong, milky coffee and booted up my Nintendo Switch. As the main menu flashed into existence before me, a new icon caught my eye. It was bold in its simplicity; a name encompassed the otherwise black image, with a silhouetted man standing within the capital letter ‘A’, flashlight in hand. The name was instantly recognisable, yet I hadn’t seen it in what felt like years. It was Alan Wake.
My mind was instantly thrown back to the year 2010 when I was a scrappy 21-year-old holding down a part-time retail job while just starting what would ultimately be a fruitless three-year course at university. I remembered that Alan Wake had been released on the Xbox 360 to critical acclaim, and the game itself had a strong impact on my life. It starred a seemingly ordinary man — the titular protagonist and writer — who embarked on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice, in the small mountain town of Bright Falls. He soon discovered that the town held dark secrets and a penchant for the supernatural.

The latest UK boxed charts are finally here after a short delay, revealing that FIFA 23 has managed to maintain its chokehold on the gaming industry as it arrives in the number one spot once again.
For Nintendo titles, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to show its popularity, climbing the ladder to number two in its 286th week in the charts. This comes as a product of a slight fall for Splatoon 3, which this week has slipped into fourth place - not that this belittles its meteoric opening by any means.

Just days after we got an official release date for The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure, NIS America has locked in a release date for the 10th game in the Trails/Kiseki series. Yes, you read that right — 10th. The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie will be launching in Summer 2023 on Switch (and all other consoles) in the West!
Trails into Reverie follows three different story paths — one focuses on Rean Schwarzer in the aftermath of Cold Steel IV, a second follows Zero and Azure&#x27;s protagonist Lloyd Bannings, and a third looks at the mysterious new character &quot;C&quot;. The game is meant to serve as a proper conclusion to both the Crossbell arc and the Cold Steel arc.

Recently we were invited by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo to pop down to TPC’s UK headquarters in London to give a build of Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet a right ruddy going over. It’s less than a month until launch – and we were informed that the build we played was not the final release build – so how is everything looking as we rapidly approach the 11th hour?
Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: in the build we played, performance is not very good. We were really quite disappointed at how the game ran in docked mode, and were unable to test its handheld capabilities. There was plenty we absolutely did like about the game, but we want to cover this hotly queried topic straight away.

Tunic has been out on the Switch for a little under a month now after gaining an impressive following on Xbox prior to this. As those of you who have played the game will know (and those who haven&#x27;t should know), Tunic is full of secrets and puzzles. Finding pages of the mysterious manual opens up more of the world than you previously knew, but even this leaves more details to find.
One such detail can be found in the game&#x27;s audio design which has now been shared on Twitter by Tunic&#x27;s Audio Director, Kevin Regamey (@regameyk). In his extremely in-depth thread (below) the artist breaks down how the game&#x27;s soundscape directly speaks to the plot and how the role of music may be bigger than we previously thought. To be clear, Regamey&#x27;s thread does contain a fair few spoilers for Tunic, so only read on when you feel ready to do so.

Sheffield-based rock band Arctic Monkeys have released their seventh studio album The Car today. This may have been something playing on the radio (or however the younguns listen to their music nowadays) here at NL Towers, but it&#x27;s now on our radar for a totally different reason today — it apparently makes a reference to City Life on the Nintendo DS.
Freelance games writer Jordan Oloman spotted a breakdown of the song &#x27;Sculptures Of Anything Goes&#x27; on Genius (thanks GamesRadar!), where one avid listener has pointed out a potential video game reference in the song&#x27;s third verse.

                              <span>Enhancements abound.
We were charmed by TRAGsoft&#x27;s take on the monster-collecting genre, Coromon, when it launched this summer (after a short notice delay). For a look back at the old-school Pokémon-style, we found it was a lot of fun and gave it a healthy 7/10 in our review. Now, we&#x27;ve got a reason to go back, as the developer announced that a brand new update has dropped for the game.
It&#x27;s a beefy update too, and the first one for Switch, with the two major headlines being Trait Enhancement and the reduction of RNG. Trait Enhancements allow you to cancel your Coromon&#x27;s evolution or even devolve it to benefit from improved versions of their trait.

                              <span>This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake&#x27;s Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don&#x27;t steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.
This puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven&#x27;t played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you&#x27;re missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, &quot;Yes&quot;. The long answer is, &quot;Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably&quot;.

It&#x27;s about starting a job in a museum and archive based around a former tobacco plantation, and run by the extremely wealthy descendants of its owners. It&#x27;s not about what great people they were. It didn&#x27;t feel like trauma porn, but obviously I can only speak as a ludicrously white person from another country.
What it is definitely good at it is representing real historical research, and who gets to write the history that suits them.

                              <span>Anyone who’s played the charming Tunic knows that it’s a little cryptic. There’s an immediately nonsensical language to try and decipher, for one thing. Then you’ve got an in-game manual that’s been pulled apart, with pages strewn around the world to find before you can figure out how to do everything your little fox is capable of. Well, now audio designer Kevin Regamey has explained a whole other secret side to Tunic, and it turns out the game’s soundtrack hides a whole other language.

                              <span>As Ed detailed in his review earlier this week, Gotham Knights is a bit of a disappointing dud. I&#x27;ve also been picking my way through Gotham City as various members of the bat family, weightlessly punching dudes in alleys before crafting new sticks that hit 2% harder than the one I was using before. Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. 


It didn&#x27;t help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady&#x27;s trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.

                              <span>Space flight simulation sequel Kerbal Space Program 2 will finally get to take off in early access on PC on February 24th, 2023, devs Intercept Games have announced. The early access version of the game will allow you to fully travel around the Kerbolar system - can’t quite believe I typed that - which has been given a major overhaul since the first game. There’ll also be more than 350 new parts to build your spacecraft with. You can watch a lengthy chat with the Kerbal team about their early access mission below.

                              <span>Last night, I caught up with a dear old friend the classic way: over a round of Left 4 Dead 2. Valve&#x27;s cooperative FPS is still a great hangout game after 13 years but while waiting for my pal to log on, I did think I might refresh it by browsing the Steam Workshop and installing some popular mods. Turns out, modders have made lots of anime girls and VTuber avatars to replace friends, enemies, and even guns. What an experience! It is startling to discover that the blue-haired anime approaching you is not a teammate but, in fact, a vomit-filled Boomer.

                              <span>In typically British, self-deprecating fashion, I’m happy to admit I’m not very good at Soulslike games, the massively successful Elden Ring included. That’s why I raised an intrigued eyebrow while sipping my seventeenth cup of tea today, after I saw Twitch streamer Luality playing FromSoftware’s latest with just a drawing tablet. Taking on the challenge with admirable confidence, Luality used a virtual keyboard on the tablet’s left side for movement, and bound strokes of the stylus to attack its enormous monsters.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I&#x27;ve been banging my head against all week. It&#x27;s an uphill fort siege where you&#x27;re facing off against an evil necromancer who&#x27;s shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone&#x27;s mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you&#x27;ve just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. 
Tactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it&#x27;s clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you&#x27;d learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I&#x27;m still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn&#x27;s opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.

This time, it’s a beta update that lets you peek inside your Deck without busting the device open. So if you were thinking of hanging your Steam Deck up like a piñata today and whacking it with a big stick to see what goodies are hiding in there, just grab the client beta update instead. You can opt in by heading to Settings, selecting System, and then the Steam Update Channel.

The expansion is part of devs Hinterland Studio’s efforts to make further improvements to the game’s Survival Mode, and will be split into multiple releases over twelve months. I’m getting a Stranger Things season four vibe from what’s been shown so far. You can see for yourself by watching the short, and quite dark, teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Resident Evil Re:Verse was meant to launch in May 2021 and had its first beta in April of that year. The multiplayer mode for owners of Resident Evil Village then slipped and slipped again. It&#x27;s now due for release on October 28th, and during this evening&#x27;s Resident Evil Showcase developers Capcom announced an early access beta for the game that will start on Monday, October 24th.

                              <span>About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

                              <span>Give us back our boy
Bastion is a pretty polarizing hero among Overwatch fans when it comes to gameplay, but I don&#x27;t think anyone can deny that he&#x27;s one of the most adorable little robots we&#x27;ve ever seen. It was exciting to get to see his rework with Overwatch 2, but fans were remiss to see that Bastion, along with the engineer hero Torbjorn, had been taken off of the roster of playable characters for the forseeable future. No need to worry, though — they were only disabled temporarily while Blizzard makes some tweaks to the heroes. This makes perfect sense, considering Bastion and Torb are two of the characters that have been reworked the most since the first game&#x27;s launch all the way back in 2016, along with others like Mercy, Hanzo, and D.va.

                              <span>It&#x27;s on My Nintendo now
A new Nintendo Halloween wallpaper just dropped via the My Nintendo program, and it&#x27;s amazingly cute, especially when it comes to the takes on certain characters.
Not unlike a Disney promo with Mickey masquerading as Count Dracula, Mario takes on a Pumpkin-Vampire-like form, with Peach as a witch, Luigi as a werewolf, Yoshi as a dragon, and Toad as a ghost. A few enemies even make it in too, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the mummy Blooper: give me that toy. The wallpaper is zero Platinum Points and fully digital.
Beyond that, Nintendo also has a &quot;spooky pumpkin-carving stencil&quot; for Splatoon 3, and reminds folks that they have a host of physical rewards currently up on My Nintendo. At the time of writing, newer restocks include the Metroid Dread poster set, as well as a Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope keychain.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>Can your PC run it yet?
Crytek has announced that its visually stunning shooter compendium Crysis Remastered Trilogy will be arriving on PC via the Steam platform on November 17 — The sci-fi revisit was previously made available to Epic Games Store in the fall of 2021, but is now close to surpassing its exclusivity deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;N45pDqpfm8g
As one would naturally expect, Crysis Remastered Trilogy contains remasters of the three highly-explosive adventures in the Crysis franchise. Odd, that. Famously resource-hungry upon their initial PC release, the titles are well known for their dynamic action, dazzling visuals, and groundbreaking special effects. Of course, this trinity of remasters only serves to add further polish to all three games, with improved lighting and weather effects, high-resolution textures, and visual enhancements to the in-game models.
If you never got around to experiencing this exciting series of actioners, (perhaps your 486 DX 2 wasn&#x27;t up to the task), then this release could prove the perfect opportunity to check them out. Steam will be launching the trilogy at a discounted price for the first week of release, with a pretty chunky 40% off of the asking price. In addition, players who already own the original Crysis Remastered on Steam will earn further discount, allowing them to round out the collection for not too many dollarydoos.
Crysis Remastered Trilogy launches on Steam November 17. It is available right now on PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Epic Games Store.

                              <span>My asterisk is probably common
Zelda: Breath of the Wild has given tons of people hundreds hours of stuff to do, but is there anything on your list you haven&#x27;t checked off yet?
This question was spurred on by this reddit post by Wickerchair, who mused on playing &quot;400+ hours&quot; of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and still coming across a &quot;???&quot; unidentified item. Another really interesting story comes from Grancola1920, who mentioned in the comments that they &quot;recently ran into a bug with &#x27;???&#x27; after 700+ hours and it flew away before [they] could catch it. Now [they&#x27;re] on a Hyrule wide bug hunt.&quot; It&#x27;s amazing that stories like these can still come out of this game, even if a lot of folks have moved on.
But what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?
For me, it&#x27;s the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds
I know! I 100%ed the game otherwise (all items that I know of/shrines): everything except the Korok Seeds. I was going to do it (and made good progress before guides were invented!), but once I saw the reward, I just couldn&#x27;t go through with it.
Growing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was &quot;worthy&quot; of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That&#x27;s enough for me.
But 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward? That&#x27;s where I check out!

                              <span>Take the writer&#x27;s eerie tale on the go
Just in time for the scary season, Alan Wake gets a new portable form. Alan Wake Remastered is out today, October 20, for the Nintendo Switch.
The listing is currently live on the eShop and going for $29.99, with a launch discount bringing it down to $23.99 right now.
Nintendo Switch&#x27;s version of the remaster contains all the content, including the base game and both The Signal and The Writer story expansions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PORiCbyWAM4
Notably, it runs on the Nintendo Switch too. Unlike some other modern games that have made their way to Nintendo&#x27;s handheld recently, Alan Wake Remastered is not a cloud app, but seems to run right off the Switch hardware.
The writer will go portable
It&#x27;s an impressive feat, and makes me a bit interested to see how the remaster holds up on Switch. Alan Wake Remastered was no visual slouch when it first released for other platforms.
That said, developers have been working some real technical magic with the Nintendo Switch lately. Just look at ports like NieR: Automata&#x27;s Switch version. As the years have gone on, it&#x27;s impressive what some have accomplished.
We&#x27;ll see if Alan Wake Remastered also stands up as a port, but as a game, it&#x27;s certainly held its following. Heck, it&#x27;s well-liked enough to even be tied into Remedy&#x27;s Control, and get a sequel greenlit for development.
This story of a writer fighting the dark with a flashlight seems to still hold sway. And if you&#x27;re curious about it and want something eerie to dig into on the go, Alan Wake Remastered is now available for that on the Nintendo Switch.

Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, the new Ubisoft developed and Nintendo-partnered adventure, is the highlight this week. New Tales from the Borderlands and Jackbox Party Pack 9 are also newer releases that are coming out day and date with other platforms.
Persona 5 Royal also deserves its own spotlight, since it&#x27;s arriving on Switch with all the bells and whistles that the Royal edition comes with. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will hit in January, if you were curious about those!

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more. 
Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a gr…</span>

Some cheeky players found a way to keep playing the beta after it ended, prompting Capcom to release a new update earlier today to delete it from player&#x27;s hard drives.

As per usual, pre-ordering the latest iteration of the long-running management sim gives you access to the beta, which is nearly-final version of the full game. It&#x27;s 20% cheaper than the full game will be when it releases on November 8th, and it&#x27;s available from Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Now, dear reader, I return once again with a free browser-based game that&#x27;s perfect for long-distance fun. But this time, it&#x27;s just about the funniest game I can remember playing. It&#x27;s called Gartic Phone.

                              <span>Square Enix have released a new cinematic (with a teeny sliver of gameplay) trailer for Final Fantasy 16 today, and crikey, there&#x27;s a heck of a lot of summons action in there. Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix&#x27;s long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you&#x27;ll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let&#x27;s take a look, shall we?

If we don’t own them already, that is. There’s a strong chance that you might have already picked up either or both of this week’s freebies. One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.

                              <span>As a James who’s always forgetting things, I’m probably the main target audience of the Silent Hill 2 remake – one of yesterday’s many Silent Hill game and film announcements. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.


Highlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.

In an update on the Overwatch forums, Blizzard confirmed that the missing characters should be returning to the game on October 25th, alongside the Junkertown map, which has also recently been disabled due to graphical performance bugs. Their return coincides with the game’s next planned update.

                              <span>The Intel Core i5-13600K fills a familiar role in the latest 13th Gen/Raptor Lake series of CPUs. There are chips in this family with many more cores and even higher clock speeds, like the £700 Core i9-13900K, but this is the one most upgrade-seekers will probably look to first: a mid-range champion to take over from the Core i5-12600K.

                              <span>Valve have updated their Steamworks documentation for developers with a commitment to refresh their suggestions for regional pricing more often. This change in frequency is an effort to reflect global and local economic conditions affecting regions. While the company reminds developers that they are free to set their own prices in different regions, Steam provides regional pricing suggestions based on the price of a game in US dollars. Those recommendations should be updated more regularly, Valve said.

                              <span>I watched a badminton match where one player was so dominant, his opponent looked like he&#x27;d largely given up. The commentator said, &quot;Yep, the belief has all but vanished&quot;, as it panned over a guy who simply wanted to be anywhere but that court. At the time, I&#x27;d already sunk some hours into Gotham Knights and taken a quick break from the action to keep tabs on a tournament and collect my thoughts. But as I turned away from the telly to dive back in for another session, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that if the same commentator had been in the room with me too, they would&#x27;ve repeated themselves. I&#x27;d simply had enough.

                              <span>In every story where a wish is granted - whether by some primary-coloured goon sticking out a lamp, a creepy piece of fairground entertainment, or a piece of cursed bushmeat - there&#x27;s always an ironical sting in the tale. You wish for health and it turns out you can&#x27;t die. You wish for a personal chef, but it turns out he only does offal. You wish everything you touch to turn to gold, then it&#x27;ll turn out there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - or it kicks in just as you go to the toilet, that kind of thing. You should, as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.
I&#x27;m sorry I wished for New Tales From the Borderlands, everyone.

                              <span>As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We&#x27;re all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It&#x27;s very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I&#x27;m sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We&#x27;re still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I&#x27;d imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted as soon as we&#x27;ve got more to share on it.
Things that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year&#x27;s list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won&#x27;t want to miss it.

                              <span>The piracy liability trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande Communications is underway. When the parties presented their opening statements, Grande informed the jury that it will present a witness who has spoken to multiple innocent infringers. That came as a surprise to the labels and prompted a request for the court to exclude &#x27;hearsay&#x27; evidence from the jury.

Earlier today, Regicide&#x27;s developers announced on Steam that the game had been taken off sale and its servers closed down. In the brief announcement, developers Hammerfall Publishing say only that they &quot;will be venturing into new and exciting projects in the future.&quot;

If it isn’t, it’s not too hard to pretend, and DRG’s another-day-at-the-office wit lends it a likeable levity that’s partly why I’ve played it almost every week for a year and a half.

                              <span>The last time we saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune in A Plague Tale: Innocence, the two homeless orphans were escaping the clutches of the Inquisition, trying desperately to find a cure for the cursed Prima Macula in Hugo’s blood. They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?
Turns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they&#x27;ll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.

                              <span>Konami might have just accidentally leaked the reveal of one of the new Silent Hill games due to be announced later this evening. Earlier this week, the publisher announced there would be a Silent Hill Transmission stream taking place today, October 19th, which would provide &quot;the latest updates&quot; on the series.

It was another close result but ultimately you couldn&#x27;t resist larking about, and I can&#x27;t fault you for that (though if I could hop up on your shoulders and Ratatouille you into voting otherwise, maybe I would).

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of rumors, leaks, and speculation regarding the future of Silent Hill, Konami is finally revealing what’s next for the long-dormant franchise. The publisher is airing a special presentation that promises new Silent Hill reveals today at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. Could it be the much-rumored Silent Hill 2 remake by Bloober Team? Confirmation of the seemingly leaked Silent Hill: The Short Message? Whatever it winds up being, come and watch the event along with us!
Editors Marcus Stewart and the freshly returned Kyle Hilliard will be streaming and reacting to the Silent Hill transmission on Twitch beginning about 10-15 mins before the festivities begin (roughly 3:30 p.m. Central/4:30 p.m Eastern). Come hang with them along with the rest of the GI community and share excitement (or disappointment) at what Konami has in store. Missed the stream? Watch the YouTube version below!

                              <span>I used to think Ghostbusters was a fantasy about having a cool car and a slidey pole in your house. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York. But I suppose it&#x27;s also about bustin&#x27; ghosts, which is what Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed&#x27;s asymmetric multiplayer replicates. It&#x27;s out today.

                              <span>The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play game - and yet somehow this isn&#x27;t today&#x27;s biggest The Sims news. That&#x27;s because, during today&#x27;s Sims Summit livestream, Maxis also announced that the next The Sims is in-development. Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

                              <span>Robot damage hero Bastion has been unplayable in Overwatch 2 for the past week due to some unfortunate shenanigans with his artillery ultimate. It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

                              <span>Collectible card game Marvel Snap has been released into early access on Steam as a free to play download. Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

                              <span>A few more classics have made their way onto EA’s list of games they’re shutting down online services for, with Mirror’s Edge the most notable casualty for PC players. The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

I first reported on this free pumpkin carving game from Adamgryu (of A Short Hike fame) way back in 2020, when it was only the 999th festival, and Alice0 took a stroll around it last year, too.
This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:
Patiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023. If you want to sign up for more updates, you can visit their website here. If you’re hungry for more Mortal Kombat, check out this trailer celebrating its 30th anniversary.</span>

                              <span>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing
Carrying case

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

An MPA investigation to identify the site&#x27;s operator was met with sophisticated countermeasures. It ended at a UK property that has been publicly linked to other crimes worth billions of dollars. And a site called KickassTorrents.

Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…</span>

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc discusses Persona 5 Royal, the hugely successful Atlus-developed RPG originally released in 2019 as a new version of the original 2016 Persona 5. After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we&#x27;ve been playing it. 
In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game&#x27;s opening moments (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven&#x27;t played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 Royal review.

Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

                              <span>I refer to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines as &quot;my favourite video game of all time&quot; with such frequency that it&#x27;s basically a catchphrase of mine. The thing is, though, I really dislike slogans; they&#x27;re meant to stir up emotions while bypassing our capacity to think critically. So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

                              <span>Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s all about pacing. Persona 5&#x27;s blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There&#x27;s a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65&quot; 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn&#x27;t enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn&#x27;t for me. At this point, I&#x27;d invested £100 into my &quot;Do I like Persona 5?&quot; experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm &quot;No, mate, you don&#x27;t&quot;. So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I&#x27;d play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

                              <span>I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I&#x27;ve been afraid to make my return. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be itching to delve back into what&#x27;s essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves&#x27; adventure, and yet it&#x27;s precisely because it blew me away the first time that I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it&#x27;s wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it&#x27;s the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm. Gi-give, no - give it here!

No, this isn&#x27;t Valve following up their Switch emulator gaffe. Wave hello to the GB Operator.

                              <span>We might finally be getting another Silent Hill game after a decade of mostly, well, silence. Konami have announced that a “Silent Hill Transmission” is set for this Wednesday, October 19th at 10pm BST / 2pm PDT. No details have been shared about whether you’ll be able to tune in on YouTube or Twitch for the stream, but Konami shared a link to a page on their site so you should be able to watch it there.

                              <span>In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an &quot;unlaunch&quot; of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right&quot;, reads Nvidia’s statement. &quot;Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the &quot;unlaunch&quot; button on the 4080 12GB.&quot;

                              <span>Blocky action RPG Minecraft Dungeons sees the arrival of the mob-packed Fauna Faire, its third seasonal update, on October 19th.

Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today&#x27;s Minecraft Live stream.

                              <span>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. 


Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Also, Wesley explains why he isn&#x27;t enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she&#x27;s been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

                              <span>In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don&#x27;t feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called &quot;Electromorphosis,&quot; which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

You&#x27;ll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.</span>

The two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it&#x27;s a game the two plan to continue playing.

Deutsche Telekom had refused to implement DNS blocking against Sci-Hub and Libgen, arguing that more reasonable options were available to copyright holders. The Court agreed that website blocking should be a last resort.

Judero is its name, and a surprisingly action-heavy adventure through the Scottish Borders is its game. Expect folklore, witches, jokes, stop motion, and beasties to battle and mind control.

You&#x27;ve likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious &quot;standing on your own shoulders&quot; uses.
The balancing of all that didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I&#x27;m generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you&#x27;re more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

                              <span>Star Trek Online turns you into the captain of your own starship. This MMORPG neatly captures the essence of years of Gene Roddenberry’s hopeful, futuristic space romp, rolling in plotlines from the TV shows and movies to create a bizarrely playable blob of nerdy entertainment. It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

The game’s developers shared a blog post updating players on how the company are monitoring gameplay, maps, and competitive rankings in the immediate post-launch period. There will, however, be a targeted adjustment to tank Zarya in the next major patch going live on October 25th, Blizzard said.

                              <span>Note to self: never eat a packet of Quavers while watching any more Dead Space remake videos ever again. It’s not a good idea for choking reasons. EA and Motive just held a 14th anniversary livestream in honour of the original Dead Space – ivory, if you were wondering – and I can not-so-safely say that the new footage shown was crisp-gaggingly intimidating. You can check it out for yourself by watching the trailer below. Try not to be too long, won&#x27;t you?

                              <span>A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I&#x27;m alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It&#x27;s all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

                              <span>We started out today with a £300 SSD that somehow manages to be &#x27;good value&#x27; (in some sense of the word, at least!) and we end it with the other side of the spectrum: the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen on a 1TB NVMe SSD. Box are asking just £57 for this Integral M-Series model, which supports 2000MB/s reads and 1600MB/s writes. Compare that to £75.99 for the same drive on Amazon, and you&#x27;ve got the makings of a great deal.

Check out the demo for Voices Of The Void, an upcoming game about running a space radio telescope array. Alone. In the woods. It has a pleasing manual process to find, target, and analyse signals, and a whole complex of servers and machinery to mantain. Plus, y&#x27;know, a whole feeling of creeping dread from gazing into space and wondering if anyone is looking back.

                              <span>You know what&#x27;s quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today&#x27;s deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

Neon Prime’s trademark was listed as for “computer game software, electronic game software, video game software, computer game programs downloadable via the internet”. So, not VR or Steam Deck hardware then.

Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

Things are working a little differently for 2022’s mob vote, though. Instead of casting your vote on Twitter, you’ll be able to head into a dedicated carnival-themed Bedrock server, do it in the Minecraft launcher, or on Minecraft.net. Devs Mojang will reveal which mob scored the most votes during the Minecraft Live livestream tomorrow.

                              <span>Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, &quot;Is there a story?&quot;. And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there&#x27;ll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it&#x27;s a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it&#x27;s about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that&#x27;s already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It&#x27;s about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It&#x27;s about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn&#x27;t have dialogue, or a map. It doesn&#x27;t really have a HUD, it doesn&#x27;t have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like &quot;Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it&#x27;ll open up a way forward!&quot; out loud. It won&#x27;t even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend it.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it&#x27;s discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let&#x27;s cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it&#x27;s nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you&#x27;re paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you&#x27;ll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

                              <span>I have wanted to play Triangle Strategy since it was first announced for Nintendo Switch, but I realise now that I know next to nothing about it. All I&#x27;ve done is look at its screenshots and salivate at the mixture of 2D sprites, 3D environments, and tilt-shift camera trickery. 

Beyond that, I know that it&#x27;s a strategy RPG, and I know that it&#x27;s out on PC as of today.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red recently updated Cyberpunk 2077 to add items from the new anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Their own updates didn&#x27;t add the show&#x27;s omnipresent risk of cyberpsychosis, however, so a modder has stepped in to do it for them. The Wannabe Edgerunner mod adds a &quot;humanity&quot; cost to all cyberware implants and certain actions in the open-world shooter, as well as consequences for when your humanity gets too low.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo&#x27;s BFF.


Bayonetta 3 is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can catch up on our exclusive features and videos at our cover hub by clicking the banner below. The game launches on October 28 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
&quot;For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Dutch Internet provider Ziggo is not required to forward piracy warnings to its subscribers, an appeal court has ruled. This is a setback for anti-piracy group BREIN, which had hoped to warn frequent uploaders without undermining their privacy. Ironically, BREIN is required to take legal action against individual pirates if it wants to get its message across.

Blocking measures have expanded to 39 countries in recent years, with the United States remaining the key absentee. The lack of US participation is partly due to a shortcoming in US copyright law, which lacks a carve-out for no-fault injunctions.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

Time to get cooking!@monsterhunter DLC is coming to Sonic Frontiers November 14th, at 5pm PST - for free! pic.twitter.com/4OV4Z4LbPB

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

                              <span>The new guards of Batman&#x27;s city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have revealed that Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Great, Daddy Day Care) will star in the studio&#x27;s next game, which remains unannounced. 
This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

As you can see, Kojima has now moved away from &quot;Who Am I?&quot; to &quot;Where Am I?&quot; alongside a tease that we&#x27;ll likely learn more at one of the two rem…</span>

                              <span>Are you ready to be sent to Camp ChillyWawa and Dr. Periowinkle&#x27;s mansion as an intelligence agent?
Armed with a book of knowledge, or Pink Digital Assistant, your mission will be to save children from dangerous threats and undo a spell cast on a little girl who has been transformed into a wombat. To succeed you will need to visit several countries and even travel into the past. On your way you will encounter historical monuments and exhibits.
The ScummVM team is proud to announce that The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril and The Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink are finally ready for their testing period.
If you want to help with the tests, use the latest daily build of ScummVM to play the Windows version of the games. Please report any issues you encounter on our bug tracker. Be sure to follow our testing and bug reporting guidelines.
