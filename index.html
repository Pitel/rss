                              <span>As Hollywood still grapples with strikes and other issues, Disney CEO Bob Iger is pressed on a different matter: gaming. According to Bloomberg, advisers at the company want to expand its video game outreach by transforming Disney from distributing game license to a gaming giant. However, Iger is reportedly not too keen on the idea.


Bloomberg&#x27;s report outlines the struggles facing Disney and its CEO in detail. Options like gambling, through ESPN and sports betting, have been something that Iger reportedly pushed back on but has now relented on. For gaming, while Disney has licensed their properties to studios, it sounds like Iger&#x27;s deputies want Disney more involved in the process. One potential option raised by the report is an acquisition, suggesting Electronic Arts as a suitable pick-up.


EA, one of gaming&#x27;s biggest publishers, seems like an ideal candidate to buy. Over the years, the company has created hugely successful franchises like Titanfall, Mass Effect, and Battlefield. Money-wise, the gaming giant is responsible for the EA Sports catalog of games, which rake in millions a year and lines up with its ESPN interests. EA also has a history with Disney, as they licensed Star Wars for their Battlefront and Jedi series of games. 


Curiously, it sounds like Bob Iger isn&#x27;t interested in the idea right now. While no reason is given, it&#x27;s likely that it&#x27;s not a direction he wants to take Disney. These all are rumors, so, much like the story of Disney&#x27;s Kingdom Hearts, don&#x27;t take it too seriously.

                              <span>No, you&#x27;re not reading that wrong. Former late-night host and Cinderella star James Corden reportedly hosted a town hall meeting for Activision. The company, run by Bobby Kotick, is making headlines as Microsoft may close its $68.7 billion purchase of them on Friday. 


According to sources speaking to Windows Central, an internal meeting between Kotick and employees recently occurred. James Corden, the &#x27;mastermind&#x27; behind Carpool Karaoke, emceed the conference, much like Jamie Kennedy did at E3 2009: unnecessarily. Kotick, who has been CEO of Activision since 1991, responded to a bevy of questions.




He talks about the potential for AI and VR, as well as Elon Musk&#x27;s Neuralink. Weirdly, he also mentions that, with Microsoft&#x27;s advanced technology, a potential Guitar Hero revival was teased. A repeated phrase that popped up a lot during the meeting was &quot;magic&quot;, as Kotick believes Microsoft will keep it alive, just as Activision has for more than 40 years.


It seems like the company, likely to soon become part of Microsoft, wants to deliver fresh content to consumers. Having already absorbed studios Blizzard and King, Activision can finally work on creating a bigger legacy. However, it seems they want to experiment with new technologies more than to build upon what they have. Microsoft had said they wanted to compete with Apple and Google in mobile gaming, which led to them purchasing Activision. While some may dislike the company, Call of Duty, Candy Crush Saga, and World of Warcraft continue to make millions of dollars every year. Where the future might go is unclear. But please don&#x27;t let James Corden be in Call of Duty.

                              <span>Blizzard has been on the back foot for a while, especially after their flood of bad press and the poor launch of several key games (like Warcraft III: Reforged, among others). Now, they&#x27;re finding themselves backed into a corner with their 2023 BlizzCon bundles. What&#x27;s the issue? Well, the value prospect, for one, coupled with the poor current state of several of their games.


Let&#x27;s go over what the bundles actually are, and you can make a decision from there.

So for $29.99, the &quot;Epic Pack&quot; comes with the following:

                              <span>The world of Gege Akutami&#x27;s Jujutsu Kaisen is about to enter a whole new domain: video games. As revealed in today&#x27;s trailer, Byking and Bandai Namco&#x27;s Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash launches on February 2, 2024.




What does the Jujutsu Kaisen game cover?


In the game, players make their own 2v2 teams with more than 15 characters from the manga/show to choose from. As each character has their own set of abilities and attacks, combining them with others can lead to unique power dynamics


Narrative-wise, Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash adapts the events of season one of the anime, as well as Jujutsu Kaisen 0. In the story mode, you&#x27;ll face familiar villains like Sukuna and Jogo and learn about the hidden world of sorcerers. With co-op and competition modes, you&#x27;ll be able to team up with fellow sorcerers online and face others worldwide in casual or ranked battles. Players will also get to customize their face cards and fighters via costumes. New outfits and cards can be unlocked through gameplay and future DLC.

Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash will be available in three editions: standard, digital deluxe, and digital ultimate. While the standard only includes the base game, the digital deluxe has the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death DLC and a minigame based on Jujusta 2024 Baseball. Furthermore, the digital ultimate edition comes with all that plus a digital artbook and soundtrack. Additionally, it comes with a costume pack adapting outfits from the &quot;Lost in Paradise&quot; end theme from season one. If you preorder the game, you&#x27;ll receive the First-Year Jujutsu High DLC costume pack.


Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash expands onto current-gen consoles on February 2, 2024. Pre-orders for Xbox, PC, and PlayStation consoles are available now, with Nintendo Switch&#x27;s to be available at a later date.

                              <span>I&#x27;m into how weird Super Mario Wonder is. Look, all the obvious jokes about shrooms have already been made, but this game looks strange on the whole. That&#x27;s a great thing, as 2D Mario has been formulaic throughout its history, so we could use a change-up. I&#x27;m just glad we&#x27;re presumably done with the &quot;New&quot; series: I mean, it&#x27;s not new anymore! 


All that to say, I just really wanted to share this strange promotional tweet of Bowser being really into an elephant Peach (which is also on YouTube as a short).




Peach speaks (kinda)


In the short 30-second promotional video, Bowser tries to impress Princess Peach with a bouquette of flowers (as he does), and an Elephant Fruit sidles up to the duo and turns Peach into an elephant. After his initial shock, Bowser immediately proposes (we assume) to Peach again. Classic Bowser, completely undeterred by pretty much anything in his life. I can&#x27;t wait to see him again in Super Mario RPG: he&#x27;s been missed.


Interestingly enough, this is also a brief look at the voice of Peach, amid a major casting change for Mario. Just give us the full voice credits already, Nintendo! I want to see who has been replaced.


Super Mario Bros. Wonder is out on Switch on October 20, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do. I have a feeling that what Nintendo has shown off so far is just scratching the surface, which would be the shot in the arm the 2D series needs right now.

                              <span>Nintendo is going to launch a Kyoto storefront (at Kyoto Takashimaya SC) to expand its current lineup in Tokyo and Osaka on October 17 of this year, and they&#x27;re in the &quot;full hype mode&quot; stage of marketing at the moment. This round comes in the form of photos from the publisher&#x27;s official Nintendo Tokyo Twitter account, and the store really sells itself at this point.




In addition to Mario-laden structures like a giant pipe (complete with Mario&#x27;s head coming out of it) and a classic &quot;Mario stage&quot; motif, there are decals for Zelda, Animal Crossing, Pikmin (which I almost missed!), and Splatoon adorning the windows. While three of the four photos showcase the impressive and thematic outside of the store, one of them gives us a look at the merch that will presumably be on sale


At a glance, we spot:



Giant pipe statues


Plush mushrooms and Mario characters/enemies


T-shirts


Bags



Nintendo also gave us an official blog post, with a preview of more merch.


It&#x27;s not going to be an all-comers situation though, at least at first. Nintendo notes that &quot;A total of 2,000 people will be invited to the pre-opening by lottery,&quot; where you can score visits on October 13 and 14. If you&#x27;re local or plan on visiting Kyoto on those dates, you can apply for the lottery here.


Good luck! I&#x27;ll likely be there once the crowds die down the next time I visit Japan.

                              <span>PS Plus Premium members are getting a neat extra perk for their subscription. Sony announced on PlayStation Blog that cloud streaming is coming for select PS5 titles later this month.  


These titles range from ones available on the PlayStation Plus catalog to digital purchases already in users&#x27; libraries and Game Trials. Supported titles range from the Resident Evil 4 remake to free-to-play games like Genshin Impact. In-game purchases are also available for streaming, which Sony compares to purchases from downloaded games.


Some PS5 cloud streaming features include playing at up to 4K with HDR and access to the console&#x27;s audio capabilities. Video capture is also available for up to 3 minutes along with screenshots.


PS5 cloud streaming will launch worldwide in phases based on the region. Japan will receive the feature first on October 17 before reaching Europe on October 23. North America has the latest launch on October 30. The feature will only be available on PS5 consoles at launch.


Cloud streaming their games is a neat perk to the service for anyone with PS Plus Premium and is low on storage. Even with the PS5 Slim&#x27;s 1TB of storage, many modern games are exorbitantly big, so being able to stream them could potentially mitigate storage issues at least a bit.


Whether PS5 cloud streaming adds substantial value to PS Plus Premium is up to the individual player. Game Trials potentially benefit from this since they are more or less extended demos, meaning far less time investment. Even so, PS cloud streaming can be spotty even with great internet. 


Hopefully, any benefits from streaming PS5 titles will outweigh the cons that come with it. Its use will vary with each subscriber&#x27;s internet speed, but ideally, it helps avoid lengthy download times.

                              <span>Sony has announced what games are being added to their various PlayStation Plus tiers this month, and buried with the rest of their Classics Catalog additions is I.Q. Final. It will be arriving on October 17.


I.Q. Final is the sequel to 1997’s I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, which you may remember from PS1 demo discs. It’s a fantastic little game that presents a great challenge, terrific music, and a tremendous blow to your self-esteem. It has you dropping bomb tiles to try and clear a path through a rolling stack of blocks. Don’t blow up the forbidden tiles, though. Each one you accidentally destroy drops a row from the platform you’re standing on, which dwindles throughout, drastically cutting down the time you have to surgically clear a path through the blocks.


The 1998 sequel was never released in North America. It was released in Japan as Kurushi Final: Mental Blocks and Europe as I.Q. Final. Even with its various PlayStation Network releases, it never made it over here. The sequel comes with four modes: 100 Attack, Survival, Create, and Final. 100 Attack has you take on individual puzzles, Survival is an endless mode, and Final is the classic design.


I recently discovered the greatness of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube. After I completed it, I then immediately researched where I could go next, only to find none of the sequels came to North America. This includes 2000’s I.Q. Remix+ and 2006’s I.Q. Mania. So, finally getting I.Q. Final is an absolute treat.


Unless they leave it in PALs 50hz format. And unless they make it only available to Premium subscribers. I have to admit, Sony has a great vector on hurting my feelings.


I.Q. Final joins the PlayStation Classics Catalog on October 17.

On the other hand, I&#x27;m surprised by one particular game&#x27;s inclusion.

Here are the titles joining Extra and Premium:



Alien: Isolation


Gotham Knights


House of Ashes


Outlast 2


Disco Elysium: The Final Cut


Dead Island: Definitive Edition


Elite Dangerous


Far: Changing Tides


Gungrave G.O.R.E.


Eldest Souls


Roki



Meanwhile, the Classic Catalog additions are as follows:



Tekken 6 (PS3)


Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny (PSP)


Ape Escape Academy (PSP)


I.Q. Final (PS1)



This certainly is a decent bunch of additions, but with the recent PlayStation Plus price hike, there’s no way I’ll be touching the Extra and Premium tiers. Even the Classic Catalog additions are better than the usual fare, with I.Q. Final being an especially interesting addition. I can only hope that the PS1 and PSP titles are available piecemeal, which is never guaranteed with Sony.


As for new games, Alien: Isolation is one of my favorite horror games. Elite Dangerous is a rather robust space exploration game from a legendary series. Disco Elysium is one I haven’t gotten around to because I’m afraid it might be too depressing for my mindset. Meanwhile, I really don’t like Dead Island. Something for everyone.


These titles will be arriving for the various PlayStation Plus tier subscribers on October 17.

                              <span>Deep Silver and Plaion has revealed that the first expansion for Dead Island 2, titled Haus, will be released on November 2. According to the Expansion Pass for Dead Island 2, Haus is the first of two planned story expansions. In Haus, players will explore new locations and discover new weapons and skill cards while having a front-row seat to the slow decay of a cryptic group of survivors.

A Deadly Trip to Malibu


The expansion will bring players to a surreal psycho-horror dreamscape in Malibu as they investigate a mysterious cult. The storyline-focused expansion revolves around a billionaire cult that has left behind humanity&#x27;s moral restraints. The stylish Malibu villa will serve as both a sanctuary and a machine as players explore the deranged labyrinth.


From a gameplay perspective, Haus will introduce several new weapons. The new K-ROSSBOW, Hog Roaster, and Dead Islands weapons were mentioned in the release. There are also eight new skill cards that players can acquire to expand their arsenal.


Dead Island 2&#x27;s Haus expansion releases on November 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost upon us. After 13 years, fans will soon experience the sequel to the cult horror Xbox 360 hit. If you&#x27;re excited about the game, would you be interested in a free copy? Let me rephrase: would you be interested in a free copy if you&#x27;re already purchasing a new graphics card?


That&#x27;s what Nvidia is currently offering, at least. If you&#x27;re in the market for some current-gen graphical firepower, and you want some survival horror goodness to go with it, you can get Alan Wake 2 free with purchases of select GPUs.




According to the Nvidia website, you&#x27;ll be eligible if you buy an RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080, and 4090 (if you feel like splashing out). It&#x27;s not just PCs, either. A laptop powered by the mobile versions of the 4070, 4080, and 4090 graphics chips also qualify.


T&#x27;s and C&#x27;s apply


Nvidia is offering this bundle until November 13, so you have a couple of weeks after the game comes out to take advantage of it. Of course, not everyone can afford brand-new hardware right now, but if you are looking to upgrade, this might be an enticing offer. Do check the site for full terms and conditions, though.


Alan Wake 2 is also one of the few games that features version 3.5 of Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS upscaling tech. As such, it kind of makes sense that Team Green would want to partner with developer Remedy Entertainment.


As for the game itself, we&#x27;re fast approaching spooky season, so horror is going to be everywhere by the time Halloween rolls around. Fans of the original are no doubt looking forward to the much-anticipated sequel. Hell, even I&#x27;m keen to check it out, and I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of Alan Wake to begin with.

                              <span>As one of the biggest video games in history, Minecraft has maintained a steady stream of content to keep old fans happy while enticing newcomers. Its annual Mob Vote also means players can decide which creature gets added next. However, some want to see this get tossed into lava.


A recent petition is asking the developer to &quot;stop the Mob Vote,&quot; scrapping this voting system entirely. At the time of writing, 354,836 people have signed, with 500,000 being the eventual goal. 




Mob voting for 2023 is said to begin October 13. It offers a chance for fans to have some say in what mob gets implemented into Minecraft&#x27;s world. Last year, it was the turn of the Sniffer. This year, people are being asked to choose between the penguin, the crab, or the armadillo.

                              <span>Just one week after its release, Paradox Interactive has revised its sales forecast for The Lamplighters League. In a public statement, Paradox Interactive revealed they would be writing down capitalized development cost on the turn-based RPG. The publisher announced it plans to write down MSEK 171, or roughly $15.7 million USD.




Per Investopedia, a write-down is an accounting action that reduces the value of an asset to offset a loss or expense. The write-down is based on a revised sales forecast established after the game&#x27;s release.


The statement goes on to reveal the capitalized development costs of The Lamplighters League to be MSEK 320, which equates to about $30 million USD. The newly revised sales forecast puts the fourth quarter profit impact estimates for the game at MSEK -248, which is just shy of $23 million USD.



&quot;The Lamplighters League is a fun game with many strengths. Even though we see cautiously positive player numbers in subscription services, the commercial reception has been too weak, which is frankly a big disappointment. Game projects are by their nature always risky, but at the end of the day we haven’t performed at the level we should. It is painful but makes us more eager to roll up our sleeves and do better.&quot;
-Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive



Essentially, Paradox is saying The Lamplighters League is off to a slower start, so it&#x27;s writing down expenses as a loss it doesn&#x27;t expect to immediately recoup. Paradox Interactive is a publicly traded company. As such, they are obliged to disclose this information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU nr 596/2014).


As a reminder here, The Lamplighters League just released a week ago on October 3. Hopefully, this is just Paradox Interactive mitigating its own economic risk, and not a sign of things to come in a recently hectic industry.

                              <span>Whispergames and Onion Soup Interactive have announced that the long-anticipated microgame masher Super 56 is finished cooking and is out the door. It’s available on PC starting today.


I tried out Super 56 during last February’s Steam Next Fest and came away impressed. It was scheduled to hit Early Access that same month but was delayed. The team has now decided to completely skip Early Access and just drop the piping-hot finished product right into your lap.




Super 56 is a WarioWare-like rush of microgames. As the name implies, there’s 56 of the little experiences, but the twist is that you control them with only one button. This one button does a lot of heavy lifting, as the short games run the gamut between racing and archery. Similar to WarioWare, it’s filled with some extremely unhinged humor and nostalgia-tickling references to older games.


I’ve been playing it before release, and it’s fantastic. A full review should be coming in the next few days. I just wish I could get the theme out of my head.


You won’t be taking a big chance if you don’t wait for my review. Super 56 is available on Steam for the reasonable price of $6.99. Those butts aren’t going to shoot themselves.

                              <span>Dotemu has announced the arrival of a new content update for 2022’s Windjammers 2. While two new characters may seem like the most substantial addition, the fact that it’s getting a long-overdue tutorial mode is probably the most important.


I reviewed Windjammers 2 back at launch and thought it was okay. Above-average, mainly helped by its reasonable asking price. However, there were a lot of areas that needed more love. In particular, the game had no tutorial. Instead, it gave you a PowerPoint presentation on the basics, then shoved you out the door to compete with no experience. With the update, there will be a lessons mode, as well as a simple practice. I really can’t believe it’s taken this long.




Speaking of long overdue, the update also comes with crossplay and lobbies. The press release notes that the rankings will be wiped along with these additions, so you’ll need to warm your Frisbee arm back up if you want to climb to the top.


Beyond that, two new characters are being added to Windjammers 2. The first is Anna Szalinski from Poland. She’s a weightlifter, and I really dig how one of her idle animations is to drop and do pushups. The second character is a bit more exotic. It’s the android Jamma GX03 who looks cool and is compatible with the semi-universal standard for amusement machines.


The update for Windjammers 2 is available today on PC and consoles. For the next two weeks, the base game will be marked down 50% on Steam, Nintendo eShop, and with a PlayStation Plus subscription.

                              <span>Strictly Limited Games and ININ have announced Irem Collection Volume 3. It’s set for Q2 2024 on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, which gives time for the first two collections to actually be released.


Irem Collection Volume 3 will include Mr. Heli, Mystic Riders, and Dragon Breed, which are all scrolling shoot-’em-ups. To be fair, that’s sort of what Irem was known for. Mr. Heli released in arcades in 1987. It was known in North America as Battle Chopper. Mystic Riders is similar to the Cotton series in that it involves piloting a broomstick. Finally, Dragon Breed is perhaps the most unique of the bunch because it has you riding on a big Asian-style serpent dragon.




As a reminder, Irem Collection Volume 1 includes Image Fight, Image Fight 2, and X Multiply (which was a spin-off of the Image Fight series). Irem Collection Volume 2 includes Air Duel, but breaks from the pack by also bundling Gun Force and Gun Force 2, which are run-and-guns considered precursors to the Metal Slug series.


Each collection includes an assortment of filters, leaderboards, rewind, and save states. All of the collections will be available digitally, but you can get them physically from Strictly Limited Games in limited and collector’s edition flavors.


Irem Collection Volume 3 currently has a broad release date of Q2 2024. However, Irem Collection Volume 1 is right around the corner and will release on November 21, 2023, on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

                              <span>After years of hope, Valve finally released Counter-Strike 2 towards the end of September. The game – which sees it replacing CS:GO – exploded in popularity overnight. However, for those on older systems, the updated version of the iconic FPS will no longer be supported.


In a recent post on the Steam Support page, the message reads that Valve will cease supporting Counter-Strike 2 on &quot;older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems.&quot; So if you&#x27;re still running Windows XP or older, you&#x27;re going to be out of luck.




For those on Mac, things seem worse. The post goes on to say that the developer will &quot;no longer support macOS&quot; at all. These outdated PCs and the total macOS users only account for around one percent of players, Valve says.


Instead, you&#x27;ll get this...


While Counter-Strike 2 will be moving forward with exclusively 64-bit Windows and Linux operating systems, those who are on older machines are being offered a &#x27;legacy version&#x27; of CS:GO. However, support for this will only be ongoing until January 1, 2024, though the game will &quot;still be available.&quot;


This legacy version is a &quot;frozen build&quot; of CS:GO and will come with all the features of the game, just not official matchmaking. Valve says those who can no longer play Counter-Strike 2 are eligible for &quot;Prime Status Upgrade&quot; refunds, though there are some provisos to that.


Despite the hype surrounding this updated version of the legendary Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the game currently has a &quot;Mixed&quot; review score on Steam. Some of this could be due to CS:GO no longer being available, and the removal of support for macOS and older PCs might see further criticisms heading the game&#x27;s way.

                              <span>French audiovisual/telecoms regulator/anti-piracy agency Arcom is being credited for the decline in BitTorrent-related piracy over the past 12 years. In 2010, eight million French pirates used the protocol but in 2022 that figure was down to just two million, a government report concludes. The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the &quot;paragon of the future.&quot; The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a &quot;deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces.&quot;


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive&#x27;s scrapped version of Dead Island 2.</span>

                              <span>If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have &quot;hundreds&quot; of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming&#x27;s mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you&#x27;re a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

                              <span>In 2006, the iconic Super Mario series celebrated 10 years since its triumphant leap to 3D with Super Mario 64. That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics. While many celebrated the continued success of this 3D evolution for on…</span>

                              <span>Nearly two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. With reports indicating that the deal is set to close tomorrow, on October 13, the saga is almost over. Ahead of that deal&#x27;s finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we&#x27;ve learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

Instead, they’ll cost you another $40 - as much as the whole of Overwatch 1 did when it was first released. As you can imagine, people aren’t too chuffed.

                              <span>Video game concerts are some of my favourite things in the world. Final Fantasy’s Distant Worlds, the NieR:Orchestra concerts, the Sonic Symphony - whatever particular series is your personal earworm, hearing music you’ve spent dozens or hours of hours listening to performed by a live orchestra can be incredibly moving and transformative. For those who feel that kind of connection with Stardew Valley, the engrossing farming-slash-romance-slash-dungeon-crawling sim is taking its OST on the road next year.

This wireless mouse is an all-time favourite for me, as it combines a simple and relatively lightweight design with bulletproof wireless and an incredible modding community that have turned this mouse into the basis for hundreds of other designs. 
As you might have guessed from the category and the title of this post, the G305 Lightspeed normally costs $50, but today it&#x27;s down to $35 at Amazon for Prime Big Deal Days.

Amazon&#x27;s Prime Big Deal Days kicks that tendency into overdrive, with Keychron&#x27;s V3 TKL keyboard dropping from $90 to $60. 
That&#x27;s a fantastic price for a keyboard that sports features normally seen on custom keyboards: hot-swappable switches, QMK/VIA programmable firmware and gorgeous double-shot PBT keycaps.

It comes from unnamed sources at Activision-Blizzard, describing a recent all-hands meeting during which CEO Bobby Kotick laid out his vision for the company and gaming at large following Activison&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft, which is tipped to finally conclude this week. Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&amp;D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim. It sounds like a David Lynch fever dream.

Because, for lower-end and mid-range builds especially, do you truly need any other CPU cooler? The Hyper 212 Evo V2 near-perfectly  balances simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability; it’s like the PC component equivalent of Charles Eames’ museum-beloved leg splint, only less stackable. More to the point, it’s down to £33 in the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale, equalling its lowest price of 2023 thus far.

                              <span>Ara: History Untold&#x27;s headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you&#x27;ve decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the &quot;father of wargaming&quot;, in the mid-1800s. 


&quot;It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,&quot; says Menard. &quot;And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


&quot;They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it&#x27;d be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can&#x27;t see what the other person&#x27;s doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It&#x27;s the next turn - let&#x27;s see what people did. Was it what you expected?&quot;

But cor, what a feast for the eyes these luxuries can be when they’re running a game that supports their full, wrap-around resolutions. The Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale also just happens to be on hand to take some of the monetary sting out of an ultrawide upgrade, with several well-specced displays getting chunky discounts.

                              <span>In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy &#x27;tactile&#x27; style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

                              <span>The consolidation of the games industry threatens to continue apace, as rumours surface that senior Disney staff are urging CEO Bob Iger to acquire a major game company, such as Deluxe Paint and Shaq Fu publisher Electronic Arts (who also publish Battlefield and Apex Legends, if I remember correctly). Apparently, the aforesaid senior executives think Disney are losing out for merely licensing Disney properties to developers, but Iger is said to be &quot;noncommittal&quot;.

The trigger is this year&#x27;s Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang&#x27;s current headcount and Microsoft&#x27;s resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

The new EPYC 8004 series are designed to maximize the power efficiency for server deployments from the data center to edge, teclo, and other non-traditional server environments. Up for testing today is an initial look at the Siena performance in the form of the EPYC 8324P and EPYC 8324PN 32-core parts for seeing how they stack up against 32-core Intel Xeon Scalable &quot;Sapphire Rapids&quot; performance.</span>

This guide was originally published back in February 2022 with the title &#x27;All Six American Football Games On Switch (Yes, You Read That Right)&#x27;. However, in the time since, several more gridiron games have appeared on the system — there&#x27;s now a total of 11 by our count — so we&#x27;ve rejigged and updated things a little bit to make this a comprehensive list of every American Football game on Switch. Let us know below if we missed any and we&#x27;ll be sure to update. Enjoy!

As we write this it&#x27;s nearly time for the SUPER BOWL, which we understand has to be shouted with great enthusiasm. As a bit of history, here in NL Towers during Thanksgiving we had a bright idea - &quot;Let&#x27;s do a best NFL-style list for Switch, like the proper football / soccer one we did in the Summer!&quot;

Disney executives are reportedly encouraging CEO Bob Iger to consider expanding Disney from a &quot;gaming license&quot; to a &quot;gaming giant&quot;.
In a report published by Bloomberg (via VGC), it seems that all is not happy at the House of Mouse, with reports of discontent following comments made before the SAG-Aftra strike and a handful of flops at the box office. And one way that executives have suggested that Disney can get back on even footing is by looking at video games.

Bringing cult classics to a more modern, updated platform can be a risky proposition. What, if anything, do you change, and what do you keep the same? When the game you happen to be porting originated on the DS, a certain degree of change is inevitable given the shift from a two-screen to a single-screen format, so naturally, a careful balance has to be struck in order to rope in new players while keeping original fans happy. With Dementium: The Ward, developer Atooi has opted for the safest route possible, porting its 2015 3DS remaster of the 2007 original over to the Switch with as few unnecessary changes as possible. While this makes for an authentic recreation that helps preserve the game in light of the 3DS eShop closure, it also highlights some of its unfortunate drawbacks.
Taking place within a creepy medical ward, your protagonist awakens with no memory, and it’s up to you to escape from the complex alive, fighting off gruesome enemies and solving puzzles along the way. It’s your typical survival horror but with first-person mechanics; in a way, it feels like a precursor to what Resident Evil would eventually morph into with its seventh mainline entry.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is just around the corner, launching on the Switch on October 20th, 2023. As such, Nintendo is ramping up its marketing campaign with adverts left, right, and centre, making sure that everybody and their Nan are aware of the upcoming title.
The latest ad is a rather amusing video showcasing Peach and her persistent stalker, Bowser, who forgoes the usual kidnapping plot in favour of a simple flower. However, a piece of Elephant Fruit tumbles by and is quickly absorbed by Peach, transforming her into Elephant Peach.

We&#x27;re less than a week away from Sonic&#x27;s return to the second dimension (well, not really, but it&#x27;s a side-on platformer in the classic mould, okay?) in Sonic Superstars. After spending some hands-on time with it back at Summer Game Fest, this throwback to the classic 2D games was showing a lot of promise, so we&#x27;re eager to see if the wait has been worth it.
As is customary, Japanese gaming publication Famitsu has its review out several days before other outlets around the globe, and it seems like a positive outcome for Sonic fans, as highlighted by Ryokuta2089. (Thanks, Gematsu.)

With the news that the Wii U and 3DS online services will be shut down in &#x27;early April&#x27; 2024, fans are undoubtedly dismayed at the idea of no longer being able to play certain games online.
One such title is the original Super Mario Maker, which launched on the Wii U back in 2015 before a 3DS version followed in 2016. The key thing with this one is that the vast selection of community-built levels will be unplayable once the online servers shut down (presumably, the original creators will still be able to play their own levels).

                              <span>LG makes a ton of monitors, so it&#x27;s perhaps unsurprising that I wasn&#x27;t familiar with their 34WP60C-B ultrawide model. This unassuming choice normally retails for $450, but does offer a higher-than-average 160Hz refresh rate to go along with a 34-inch VA panel and 3440x1440 resolution. 
Today though, this monitor crashes into new relevance as it&#x27;s been discounted to just $200 at LG&#x27;s US store, an incredible price that makes it almost an impulse buy pickup for anyone that wants to try out the majesty of an ultrawide monitor.

                              <span>Samsung&#x27;s 990 Pro PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is the fastest gaming drive we&#x27;ve ever tested - faster even than the Crucial T700, a PCIe 5.0 SSD. And unlike that SSD, the 990 Pro works on a wide range of PCs and even the PS5, and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. 
In fact, today it&#x27;s down to $129.99 for a 2TB Heatsink model on Amazon as part of the firm&#x27;s Big Deal Days, which is a pretty sweet offer - albeit one restricted sadly to Prime customers.

                              <span>One thing that keeps luring me back to Starfield - other than the idea of building space stations out of onions - is a mysterious game within the game. Titled &quot;Symbol Game&quot;, it consists of chunky, etched, sloping pieces and a 4x6 grid mat adorned with stars, dots and lines. You may have pocketed a few sets, during your journeys across the Settled Systems. They&#x27;re not hard to find. But as far as I can tell, nobody has discovered the rules, though there are plenty of theories.

                              <span>Alienware&#x27;s AW3423DWF is a fantastic gaming monitor - and the one that I was the most sad to return after my review. This 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide debuted at $1100 last year, but it&#x27;s now available for $300 off at Dell&#x27;s US store in a nicely-timed Anti-Amazon deal. That brings it to $800 - still a lot of money for a monitor, but absolutely worth it for a monitor that has become well-loved for users and critics alike.

Created by Latvia-based Pahris Entertainment, it launches out of Early Access today with a brace of Very Positive reviews, tantalising perma-hungover Disco Elysium players like me with flirtatious mention of &quot;an intentionally short&quot;, very non-linear campaign in which combat is totally optional and there are &quot;three to eight ways&quot; to complete any quest. &quot;It&#x27;s okay to fail,&quot; you say? Every NPC can be killed, even those apparently central to the story? Be still my beating heart.

                              <span>Are you a Mac player who&#x27;s been hungrily looking forward to the eventual Mac port of Counter-Strike 2, released last month, after sinking many hours and much pocket money into the preceding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Fantastic news, it&#x27;s been binned off! In the course of making what they&#x27;re calling &quot;the largest technical leap in CS history&quot;, Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They&#x27;re also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems.

                              <span>Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

                              <span>Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a &quot;mixed reality&quot; device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

                              <span>The Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale is proving to be the first of its kind – that’s right, Prime Day, apply yourself – to make notable cuts on the very latest and greatest GPUs. You can find all of the highlights in our Prime Big Deal Days graphics card deals guide, but I wanted to draw special attention to a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti listings; the most attainable members of the infamously pricey RTX 40 series, now even lighter on the old wallet.

                              <span>We recommended a dozen Steam Next Fest demos out the gate but that barely scratched the surface of the demo-o-rama. So after diving back into the demo pile myself, I have another recommendation for you: adventuring across the galaxy in roguelikelike spaceship deck-building dungeon-crawler Cobalt Core. If you enjoy Slay The Spire and FTL, do have a look, though I might argue that FTL&#x27;s follow-up, Into The Breach seems a stronger influence. Ah, play the demo and see for yourself!

As expected, SSD prices have been widely cleaved; friend of RPS Will Judd already caught the superlative WD Black SN850X going for a bargain, and it turns out a bunch of excellent Crucial drives are on sale for even less.

The game in question is Saber Interactive&#x27;s Wild Card Football, an arcade sporting sim in the spirit of the developer&#x27;s previous NBA Playgrounds series, which is out today and attracting some buzz on Steam.

It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve done one of these (apologies for that), but off the back of our free month RPS Premium trial in September, I wanted to put out another call for reader questions from our fine crop of supporters - as an extra thank you and benefit for your continued support of the site. This is your opportunity to ask us, the RPS editorial team, questions about games, the site, the way we do things, and other things we like. These questions will then be answered in our semi-regular (ish, sort of, as best we can) Ask RPS column, which is a public post available to everyone. So come and tell us what&#x27;s been on your mind in the comments below.

                              <span>Much like a Call of Duty player inching up the stairs behind a wily sniper, Microsoft are closing in on final, final approval of their multi-billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, having more-or-less won over the UK&#x27;s competition and markets authority. The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.
Aside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass subscription service.

                              <span>The idea of &quot;spoilers&quot; comes up a lot these days. In an era where our abundance of information, freely available and shareable, expands more and more every day, it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to avoid learning something you might not want to know. These can range from the ending of a show to a character death, or even to a big moment in a classic like Chrono Trigger.


What a spoiler entails can truly run the gamut of all possible, conceivable information about an event or story.

A soft reboot for the long-lasting franchise, it has taken a whopping six years for the developer Turn 10 to push out a new entry. While this would usually be cause for celebration, things aren&#x27;t looking great as it currently stands, with an impressive list of known issues in Forza Motorsport for Turn 10 to acknowledge and resolve. 


On day one of the game&#x27;s release, Turn 10 published a comprehensive list of known issues in Forza Motorsport, counting dozens of problems big and small. This, of course, isn&#x27;t a problem in and of itself, but the sheer number of bugs on show is rather impressive.

Not only does it feature a combination of genuinely moving and upbeat tracks: but my wife and I also can&#x27;t help but hum to the vast majority of the score. That&#x27;s going to be a lot more exciting to do in person of course, when the Stardew Valley concert tour kicks off next year.


Announced by Stardew creator Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone themselves, the tour will begin on February 17, 2024 in Los Angeles, California, and end mid-to-late 2024 in Bangkok, Thailand. The tour itself is called &quot;Festival of Seasons,&quot; and will feature a chamber orchestra.

Sorry for the random quote, but it feels very applicable to Diablo 4 with the Season 2 Campfire chat that just ended. In the roughly 1 hour and 15-minute stream, the Diablo team highlighted all the big changes coming to the ARPG with the launch of Season 2, Season of Blood.


I have to say, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with what I&#x27;ve seen from this devstream and last weeks. While the previous stream focused on the new content coming with Season 2, today&#x27;s instead highlighted the bigger core changes coming to Diablo 4 including class changes, quality-of-life updates, and more. I&#x27;m not willing to bet the house just yet. But, I will say this: Diablo 4 Season 2 looks promising, and I will be giving it a try. Here is a full…</span>

                              <span>I really didn’t expect RoboCop: Rogue City to even be any good when it was first revealed, let alone be absorbed in a demo of it for hours. Licensed games are rarely high up on my priorities, and even though I love RoboCop, I never thought anyone would go to the effort of doing the movie justice in a video game.


RoboCop is a lot more than just a license easily transferable to action figures. The 1987 movie was a surprisingly grey look at corporate overreach, gentrification, the role of police, and the nature of humanity, among other things. Those themes, as well as the ultra-violence depicted, make it strange that it would be adapted into a children’s cartoon. It’s so ironic for the license; an irony that was probably missed by the marketing department.


And while the action-oriented pl…</span>

                              <span>A burning question resting on fans&#x27; minds since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released is where all the Guardian tech disappeared to after Breath of the Wild&#x27;s events. Although some time passed between installments, the Guardians&#x27; omission feels odd, given their previous prevalence.


Now there&#x27;s an official answer given by Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and it&#x27;s uneventful. He stated in an interview with Telegraph that the Guardians &quot;disappeared after the Calamity was defeated (sealed).&quot;


&quot;All of the people of Hyrule also witnessed this, but there is no one who knows the mechanism or reason why they disappeared, and it is considered a mystery,&quot; said Fujibayashi. &quot;It is believed that since the Calamity disappeared, they also disappeared as their role had been fulfilled.&quot;


Fujibayashi then acknowledged how common &quot;mysterious occurrences and phenomena&quot; are to Hyrule&#x27;s various races. It&#x27;s why nobody saw this as any cause for concern since odd events are just part of everyday life.




He finishes his in-world explanation by stating how many Hyrule residents accept that &quot;ancient Sheikah technology&quot; was responsible. Many also saw it as something not worth delving into. He concluded by mentioning how both titles&#x27; civilizations are completely different, and the team based each title&#x27;s concepts on the respective civilizations.


On Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s design, Fujibayashi said the team aimed to give players an &quot;exhilarating and happy experience&quot; while exploring the Sky Islands. Meanwhile, the Depths were to provide &quot;tension&quot; to players exploring.


The official explanation for the Guardians&#x27; disappearance in Zelda being that they just left and nobody cared is honestly hilarious. It&#x27;ll likely be a while before we see them again as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom won&#x27;t have any post-launch content.

                              <span>Despite its occasional blunders, the Destiny franchise has successfully fostered a community of clever and loyal secret hunters and lore theorists who are always eager to share their thoughts with the rest of their peers. Often, this means veering deep into Destiny&#x27;s most obscure pieces of lore, with expectedly mixed results. One of the latest theories that&#x27;s been posted on the r/DestinyLore subreddit, however, has more merit than most, and it may well be on the right track, given everything it&#x27;s got going for it.


Specifically, Level8Vermin recently posted an idea of how one of Lightfall&#x27;s biggest mysteries might unravel come The Final Shape. Even though players do know by now that 2024&#x27;s DLC will see Guardians going inside the Traveler in their pursuit of the Witness, it is currently im…</span>

                              <span>Sony has finally announced the production of a slimmer PS5 model after years of rumors and speculation. It’s sent to launch “this holiday season,” which, judging from the seasonal stock in most department stores, started sometime in July.


I can’t believe it’s been nearly three years since the launch of the PlayStation 5. For the longest time, it was hard to even get your hands on one. If you were someone who persevered and got a launch model, here’s the inevitable spit in your eye.




It’s not that bad, though. The slimmer PS5 model doesn’t have any more horsepower and is coming fitted with the same size hard drive (1TB). The reveal trailer doesn’t really show off any comparison between the two models, which is because there’s not tremendous difference. It’s described as having reduced “more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24%.” So, it’s definitely leaner in line with the PS4 or PS3 redesigns. The launch model PS5 was a pretty chonky beast, so I’m sure your shelves will thank you.


It comes in both disc and all-digital versions, though the digital version will now have an option to add an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc Drive. The vertical stand is sold separately for some reason. 


The slimmer model PS5 will start showing up in stores “this holiday season.” The price remains $499.99 USD for the disc model, and 449.99 USD for the discless one.

                              <span>Despite its remarkable lore and crisp gunplay, Destiny 2 plays host to no small number of imperfections. Some of these problems have been around for literal years, to the point where players actively avoid anything to do with them. One of the most (in)famous examples of this is Destiny 2&#x27;s Attrition activity modifier. After hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the game, it&#x27;s looking like a bigger issue than most first anticipated. In fact, it&#x27;s holding back Destiny 2&#x27;s core gameplay loop.


For those who might not be in the know, Attrition is a special gameplay mutator that comes into play in select activities. When it&#x27;s active, it massively slows down the Guardians&#x27; passive health and shield regeneration as a baseline. To alleviate this, killing enemies will sometimes generate special Light…</span>

These were teased quite a while back and then shown off at the Portland Retro Game Expo last year, but they’re ready to go now. Almost.


This is the latest in Retro-Bit’s collaboration with Sega. They’ve previously released reproductions of Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controllers, as well as wired and wireless variants of the Sega Saturn controllers themselves. These ones are different from your standard Sega Saturn controllers because of the addition of dual analog sticks, rumble, and extra shoulder buttons to make them more functional with modern consoles and games.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t easy, but I&#x27;ve become the Great King of the Hittites as Kurunta the Usurper, named after the hunter god. Many soldiers died along the way, but all for a good cause. Leaders were assassinated as I worked my way up the Hittite court. Now over 100 turns of Total War: Pharaoh later, I had united the Hittites—united in a conquered sort of way—and it was time to set my eyes south towards Egypt. 


But Egypt has faced its own struggles as well. Several leaders, including Ramesses and Seti, have also been fighting for control of the Nile. Seti reigned supreme, but unfortunately for him, I had already solidified my desire to rule the sands. With the colossal pyramids in the backdrop, my siege of Cairo began. 


The Total War franchise has always succeeded in its main goal: massive battles…</span>

                              <span>Nighthawk Interactive has announced that they’ll be publishing Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s set for release on Switch.


Originally published by Bandai Namco in Japan and developed by Groove Box Japan, I’m just learning of this show featuring potato cars now. I had to look it up, but apparently, it’s popular in an internet sort of way, but I’ve never seen it. I would probably have remembered potato cars.




The potato cars are actually rodent-car hybrids, with the “mol” part of the title coming from the Japanese word morumotto, which means Guinea Pig. Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is a party game based on the concept, and it looks so weirdly compelling. I think it’s poking the same spot in my brain that Choro Q tends to jab at. Cute rodent cars living in a little playset city? Sign me up.


The art style in Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is also really charming, featuring felt-like fur on all the potato cars and a sort of stop-motion jerkiness to their animations. Beyond playing minigames involving dancing or playing cops and robbers, you can also observe/feed the potato cars and even pet them. You can dress them up and take photos of them. It’s a game that looks wholesome and cute while also having a bizarre, unhinged quality.


Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is set to release for Switch in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s been out in Japan since late 2021.

                              <span>Stellaris is probably my favorite grand strategy game of all time, so when I saw developer Fast Travel Games was creating a standalone VR roguelite set in the Stellaris universe, I immediately became interested. I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t have too much experience with VR. But the idea of a Stellaris story with its many species, systems, and space structures sounded like the perfect fit for VR. Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Story steps away from grand strategy and instead puts players in control of a single ship as they traverse systems dealing with threats, acquiring upgrades, and tracking down the Ghost Signal.


Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Story puts players in the role of the captain of a single ship called the Aurora. At the end of the tutorial the Aurora receives a mystery signal, dubbed the Ghost…</span>

The fact that the developer could be identified over five allegedly infringing screenshots comes as much more of a surprise.

After the initial tease last week, it thankfully hasn&#x27;t taken Lego and Nintendo too long to lift the lid on its latest collaborative line-up, revealing five sets based on the Animal Crossing franchise launching in March 2024.
With prices ranging from $14.99 all the way up to $74.99, the first batch in what we assume will be an extensive product line represents some of the franchise&#x27;s most beloved characters, including Tom Nook, Isabelle, and Kapp&#x27;n.

                              <span>So. Many. Games.
As we hurtle towards Holiday season, we can all agree that 2023 has been an incredibly strong year in terms of the number of quality games hitting the Switch eShop on a weekly basis. Last month alone, we published 34 reviews in 30 days, and we could have easily doubled that number based on the sheer amount of interesting-looking Switch software.
But, alas, resources are finite and inevitably we aren&#x27;t able to play and review everything we&#x27;d like to here at Nintendo Life. So, every six months or so we put out a call to our lovely community of readers to highlight gems that passed us by. Back in April, in Part 6 of our Reader Recommendations series, you highlighted 22 eShop gems, including Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon&#x27;s Fist, Floppy Knights, and Terror of Hemasaurus.

Fortnite is back with another annual Halloween event dubbed &#x27;Fortnitemares&#x27; (very droll), and this time, it&#x27;s bringing a few iconic characters with it that horror fans, in particular, will be chuffed with.
First up, we&#x27;ve got a selection of original characters, including wrapped rapscallion Seth, muckfish Bogstick, meownstrosity Phantom Meowscles, and nautilus Festival Phaedra. Good grief, what even are those words..?

The game is an expanded version of Pac-Man: Mega Tunnel Battle, which was originally released on Google Stadia. Naturally, the game was shut down in conjunction with Stadia&#x27;s closure at the start of 2023.

All five sets are available to wishlist now on LEGO&#x27;s website, and we&#x27;ve even got a cute little trailer showcasing all of them. The pages list each set as launching specifically on 1st March next year, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see if that&#x27;s just a placeholder date.

                              <span>Missing the Playoffs.
While the Nintendo Switch has never had the prominent American Football video game series, it has had some notable efforts in the Indie and retro spaces. Now we can add Wild Card Football to the mix, and it&#x27;s certainly an ambitious release in comparison to its contemporaries on the system. From Saber Interactive, it follows a similar approach to NBA Playgrounds and its 2K-pubished sequel, albeit this time the studio is flying solo and doesn&#x27;t have the official NFL license.
What it does have is an NFLPA license, the player&#x27;s association, and that&#x27;s a big part of the pitch for Wild Card Football. While teams are fictional, the players — current and former — are very much real, and interestingly the equivalents to NFL teams are named after their quarterbacks. The teams have relatively little in common with the real-world versions, albeit this Bears fan (yes, by all means feel pity for your humble scribe) was surprised that the Justin Fields team had pretty good stats. Hey, not all games have to be realistic. The handful of arenas are also neat, including a hefty stadium, urban locations like Chicago and London, a camping haven in an impressive forest, and a few other fun options. Like the studio&#x27;s previous sporting output, the approach is fantastical and entertaining.

In the wake of Unity&#x27;s highly controversial policy regarding runtime fees, which it has now altered based on community backlash, its CEO and President John Riccitiello has now stepped down. In addition, he has also stepped down from his position on the board of directors as chairman.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the change is effective immediately with James M. Whitehurst stepping up as the interim CEO and President while the firm seeks out a permanent replacement. Roelof Botha, the lead independent Unity board director, has also been appointed chairman.

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren&#x27;t as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
&quot;The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,&quot; the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the pictures. &quot;There are four separate cover panels,&quot; it says, &quot;with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.&quot; This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed its &quot;fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits&quot; first-person shooter, Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant, in 2021. It&#x27;s a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here&#x27;s Ubisoft&#x27;s full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay:

As you can see, Ubisoft doesn&#x27;t indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer&#x27;s XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

Now, the company has released a new trailer for the Animal Crossing x Lego collaboration, alongside the official reveal of five Lego sets, their prices, and the release date. 
The five sets releasing March 1, 2024, are Isabelle&#x27;s House Visit, Julian&#x27;s Birthday Party, Bunnie&#x27;s Outdoor Activities, Kapp&#x27;n&#x27;s Island Boat Tour, and Nook&#x27;s Cranny &amp; Rosie&#x27;s House.

                              <span>Almost two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company&#x27;s games won&#x27;t hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won&#x27;t be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here&#x27;s what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.

Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Diablo IV review. For more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, check out Game Informer&#x27;s preview here and then read up on the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from last week&#x27;s Call of Duty Next livestream.

Příjemné je, že se přitom podařilo povýšit verze podkladových distribucí, takže Slax nyní staví na Debianu 12.2 a nejnovější větvi Slackware.</span>

                              <span>DDR5 prices continue their continued downward spiral, today reaching a new low-water mark: $90 for a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from G.Skill. That&#x27;s an awesome price for a spec that has emerged as the current sweet spot for DDR5-compatible AMD and Intel systems.

After spending two and a bit years flexing his typing arms as our senior staff writer, Ed will now be stepping up to wrangle our reviews section into bigger and better shape than ever before - or rather, he already has, as he officially took over the role at the start of October. He will henceforth be known not simply as Edders, but as the new and improved Reviews Edders, so please come and congratulate him on his ascension in the comments below.

While Todd Howard said we’d be able to visit over 1,000 planets, the Bethesda dev actually undersold the sheer scale of Starfield’s galaxy - there are actually close to 1,700 planets, and now someone’s seen them all just weeks after launch.

                              <span>In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy&#x27;s comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that&#x27;s my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game &quot;built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.&quot;
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2&#x27;s visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2&#x27;s performance, but we&#x27;ll get to that further down the page.)

                              <span>The latest Steam Next Fest is upon us, bringing with it a freshly packed week of new, free demos to try until Monday October 16th. There are literally hundreds you could try installing if you were that way inclined - you can view the full list right here if you&#x27;d rather browse through it at your own leisure - but we&#x27;ve been playing some of these demos in advance to help make wading through its torrent of shiny new games a little bit easier. Below, you&#x27;ll find 12 of our favourites so far, ranging from snazzy-looking shooters and big RTS games to neat little autobattlers, indie immersive sims and retro puzzle platformers. If you&#x27;re in need of some guidance this Steam Next Fest, read on.

                              <span>Razer make some of the best gaming peripherals in the business across a wide range of categories, and now you can take home a whole set of them for 90 bucks over at Woot. 
The &quot;Heroic Bundle V2&quot; includes a mechanical keyboard, mouse, grip tape for the mouse and mousepad, offering a 40% reduction on buying these items separately. That&#x27;s an awesome deal and well worth considering - the only peripheral you&#x27;d really need to add is a headset!

                              <span>I do love a game that tells you upfront what it&#x27;s about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren&#x27;t dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can&#x27;t fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you&#x27;ll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there&#x27;s a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain&#x27;t so bad. As she points out, &quot;underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it&#x27;s nice and cool&quot;. Again, I can&#x27;t fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a &quot;rat god&quot;.

                              <span>“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it&#x27;s been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&amp;D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons &amp; Dragons,” he says.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker&#x27;s organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt&#x27;s firing around 100 employees in July due to &quot;overstaffing&quot;. Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren&#x27;t employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


&quot;We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,&quot; reads an official FAQ from the group. &quot;This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.&quot;

                              <span>New research from piracy tracking firm MUSO shows that movie piracy is strongly linked to box office revenues. When pirated downloads peak or slow down, movie theater visits show a similar trend. While this may sound counterintuitive, the finding is actually quite obvious. Correlation is not causation and pirates are people too.

                              <span>With Ubuntu 23.10 due for release on Thursday, I&#x27;ve been benchmarking a number of systems to look at the Ubuntu 23.10 performance against prior releases like Ubuntu 23.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Besides the open-source graphics driver performance for Intel and AMD Radeon graphics always being a stand-out improvement, one area that is particularly exciting with Ubuntu 23.10 is for those with newer AMD processors where there are some nice performance gains to find with this new Ubuntu Linux release. Here are side-by-side benchmarks of an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X desktop along with an Intel Core i9 13900K desktop while testing Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS / Ubuntu 23.04 / Ubuntu 23.10.</span>

Original story, 10/9/23:

                              <span>A man from Shrewsbury has joined a growing list of people in prison for defrauding the Premier League.

                              <span>This week on Replay Charles Harte (who recently played nearly every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game) and I are going back to 2007 for a look at the original Assassin&#x27;s Creed. With Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don&#x27;t, but in any case, it&#x27;s a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin&#x27;s Creed right here.

                              <span>Following the last entry in the New Super Mario Bros. series, which was based on the idea of recreating the experience of the original Super Mario Bros. game from 1985 in a modern way, Nintendo went back to the drawing board. Though the four distinct New Super Mario Bros. games were well-received and extremely successful, the developers wanted to deliver something fresh to fans of the 2D series.
&quot;The New Super Mario Bros. series has been going on for a while since the release of New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, so we wanted to create an all-new 2D Mario experience,&quot; Super Mario Bros. Wonder director Shiro Mouri says. &quot;That&#x27;s how this project started.&quot;
Despite the initial desire to create something new, Mouri and his development team started thinking about what made the series so disti…</span>

                              <span>Developer Arkane Studios&#x27; multiplayer vampire shooter Redfall launched earlier this year to middling reviews from critics and players alike – Game Informer gave the game a 5 out of 10. Ahead of its launch in May, Xbox revealed that Redfall would only launch with a 30 FPS Quality Mode on Xbox Series X/S, noting that a Performance Mode would arrive at a later unspecified date. Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda&#x27;s patch notes about today&#x27;s Redfall update don&#x27;t specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft&#x27;s plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren&#x27;t very superstitious), it&#x27;s not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they&#x27;re completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies&#x27; victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft&#x27;s hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

In his tweet, he writes that &quot;Telltale laid most of us off in early September,&quot; and that the layoffs occurred weeks after the company acquired U.K.-based studio, Flavourworks, which developed Erica. 
This is a sore subject, but I feel it necessary to add to the gaming layoff news: Telltale laid most of us off early September. Status of TWAU2, I can&#x27;t say (NDA).
October 5, 2023
Telltale has now confirmed to Game Informer that layoffs at the studio did occur, although its official statement features no mention of just how many employees were let go. The statement doesn&#x27;t mention severance for laid-off employees, but Huang notes on Twitter that he…</span>

You see, he’s unknowingly stuck in a reality TV show where the penalty for unpopularity is death, and considering he has the personality of a pencil, his only option is to escape in genre-bending fashion.

&quot;&gt;all but shutting up shop in 2018, Telltale Games are once again laying off staff. The company let &quot;most&quot; of its employees go in September, according to former staffer and cinematic artist Jonah Huang, who began posting about the situation on Xitter earlier in the week. Telltale have now confirmed aspects of Huang&#x27;s story, while declining to specify how many jobs have been chopped.

                              <span>HyperX&#x27;s Cloud Orbit S is a fascinating wireless gaming headset with planar magnetic drivers. Despite the name, this headset is produced by audio experts Audeze and the Cloud Orbit S is 99% the same as the Audeze Mobius, just with a slightly different colour scheme, simpler microphone and without Bluetooth support. That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. 
The Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it&#x27;s available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings.

                              <span>Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year&#x27;s installment, and searches for &quot;Axis Football 2022&quot; brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.
Axis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I&#x27;ve settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.
The result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.

                              <span>The RTX 4060 Ti has emerged as something of a sweet spot in Nvidia&#x27;s current-gen graphics card lineup, being more affordable than the RTX 4070 and above while providing better performance per pound than the 4060 below it - despite some reservations over its 8GB VRAM capacity and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance uplift compared to the RTX 3060 Ti. However, if you want access to Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. 
The RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.

                              <span>At this year’s EVE Fanfest, the annual convention celebrating the 20-year-old space MMO, Icelandic developers CCP announced a new game: EVE Vanguard. A shooter set in their gunmetal grey sci-fi universe, Vanguard puts you into the shoes of mercenaries, dropping onto planets to retrieve equipment from wrecked ships, battling it out with AI-controlled pirates and other squads of human players. It’s Escape from Tarkov by way of the galaxy of New Eden.


If you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they&#x27;ve only gotten one out the door before.

                              <span>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days sale is proving a decent source of Steam Deck accessory deals. Last week’s early offers shaved cash off some of my personal favourite cases, docks, and microSD cards, and now that the main event is underway, there’s a fresh supply of affordable add-ons for the Valve handheld. Here, we shall catalogue the best.

                              <span>I Expect You To Die 3: Cog In the Machine is notable if only for being the third entry in a series on VR games. Most VR titles can consider themselves lucky if they get a sequel, let alone attain the hallowed status of &quot;trilogy&quot;. Then again, few VR games have found a formula that is as dependable and repeatable as Schell Games&#x27; collection of spy capers. Much in the same way that the James Bond series has a set structure and tropes, only I Expect You To Die&#x27;s blueprint involves pastiche and puzzles rather than cars, gadgets, and variously objectified women.

The just-announced Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core is a crafty feat of genre-splicing in which one to four dwarven miners investigate an alien world whose &quot;core has gone rogue&quot;. As in the original Deep Rock Galactic, which we loved, you&#x27;ll be tunnelling down and fighting critters (exact species TBA) while harvesting precious ores. But this time, there&#x27;s no returning to the ship once you&#x27;ve loaded up enough. The only way out is down.

                              <span>Pre-registrations have gone live for Konami&#x27;s Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive drama for mobiles - I know, shush, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll come to PCs eventually - which follows a cast of characters around the world who are being tormented by monsters from the eponymous Town of Woe.
My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can&#x27;t let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

                              <span>Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and Starfield&#x27;s launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG&#x27;s next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you&#x27;ll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

                              <span>The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns to one of our recent previous messes to discuss Payday 3. More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man&#x27;s Sky?
We&#x27;ve also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.

                              <span>In The Lamplighters League, three evil factions are gathering the power to seize an apocalyptic tower, and you must stop them by finding and trashing their power bases. They&#x27;ll grow in power the whole time, but you&#x27;ll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who&#x27;ll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That&#x27;s a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, &quot;the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years.&quot; That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

Woah there, Dr Grant - what the hell are you talking about? Why, the just-announced Dinolords, of course - a blend of strategy and action-RPG from Northplay and Ghost Ship Publishing, in which you raise troops and build castles to fend off armies of T-Rex-riding Danes. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Very much like an assassin sliding a poison needle into your wrist while shaking your hand, Ubisoft have added Denuvo&#x27;s anti-piracy/anti-cheating DRM software to Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage in the game&#x27;s day-one update, aka patch 1.0.2. We&#x27;ve known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what&#x27;s baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

                              <span>In this episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss our latest cover story for Super Mario Bros. Wonder! Brian Shea has spent more time with the game than anyone outside of Nintendo and spoke with members of Nintendo about creating the big step for 2D Mario. Then we kick Brian out of the show to welcome Wesley LeBlanc to tell us about his experience with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage. Wesley has finished the game (and it took him less than 20 hours) and has thoughts on the game&#x27;s strange place in the pantheon of Assassin&#x27;s Creed games. Lastly, Alex shares his latest Pokémon card escapades and decides who in history he can successfully fight.

                              <span>Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you&#x27;re in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge&#x27;s first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include &quot;1-3 hours of content&quot; and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game&#x27;s publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

                              <span>The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they&#x27;re taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project &quot;in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.&quot; That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there&#x27;s still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They&#x27;ve yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is &quot;set in the world&quot; of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here&#x27;s what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here&#x27;s a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari&#x27;s Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, &quot;bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has teased a collaboration between its Animal Crossing series and Lego. It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn&#x27;t reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, &quot;Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!&quot; The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn&#x27;t the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It&#x27;s been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

                              <span>Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn&#x27;t tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn&#x27;t list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage – an Assassin&#x27;s Creed that looks to the original game for primary inspiration – is nearly upon us. Join me as I play not quite the beginning of the game, but one of the game&#x27;s earlier hours. You get to see some tutorials, a little bit of exploration, and finally, a stealthy attack on a well-guarded dock.

                              <span>Greek police say they have dismantled a criminal organization behind an illegal IPTV operation that caused broadcasters over €100m in losses. Over eight years it&#x27;s alleged the operators generated over €25 million in profits, laundered money through a network of companies, while investing in real estate and other luxuries. Ten men were arrested and a dozen cars plus €100k+ in cash was seized.

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during a special celebratory event for the franchise&#x27;s 15th anniversary. After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you&#x27;ve kept up with Mirage, you know it&#x27;s a bit of a return to the series&#x27; roots. After completing the game, it&#x27;s safe to say that&#x27;s definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…</span>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion&#x27;s Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…</span>

                              <span>French police have arrested five former Ubisoft executives after a years-long investigation that began in 2021 following complaints and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the company, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. Among the five arrested are Ubisoft&#x27;s former chief creative officer, Serge Hascoët, and former vice president of editorial and creative services, Tommy François. 
The publication learned of these arrests after French newspaper Libération reported that three former Ubisoft executives were arrested yesterday, with two more arrested today. 
The summer of 2020 marked a turning point within Ubisoft after numerous reports surfaced regarding abuse, misconduct, and power corruption happening within the company. Various executives and managers, including François, wer…</span>

                              <span>Developer Kumi Souls Games announced its gothic Soulslike metroidvania, The Last Faith, years ago, and last summer, we got a new trailer that indulged in the game&#x27;s pixelated violence. We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it&#x27;s official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don&#x27;t want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that&#x27;s available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal&#x27;s brutal environment. 
&quot;Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
&quot;Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk.&quot;
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it&#x27;s a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is &quot;driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take&quot; after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the &#x27;Alters&#x27;,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.&quot; 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
&quot;Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan&#x27;s determination to survive: I&#x27;ll just do it all by myselves,&quot; the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.

&quot;In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s announcement reads. &quot;This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.&quot;
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if &quot;an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services&quot; for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that &quot;for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.&quot; 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024.

For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio.

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s incremental moves to eliminate online privacy regularly target VPNs. To &#x27;free&#x27; itself from Google and Apple, in 2022 Russia launched its very own app store, which ironically offers dozens of VPNs. After the government recently announced the mandatory pre-installation of RuStore on tech gadgets, a draft law will outlaw censorship-circumventing VPNs on RuStore.

                              <span>Another Crab’s Treasure hooked me with its underwater Soulslike premise and cutesy charm. But once you take a closer look at the game’s polluted ocean, filled with plastic shells and weapons, the comparisons to Dark Souls get a little clearer. This is a quiet and kinda melancholy post-apocalypse. We can now find out whether the crustaceans lean on cuteness or sadness more in the game’s new demo, released just yesterday.

That&#x27;s a great price for a drive that more than doubles even the highest capacity Steam Deck sold by Valve, and makes a tremendous upgrade for 512GB and 256GB Steam Deck owners too.

                              <span>Brian Jacques&#x27; Redwall books were my greatest obsession between the ages of approximately eight and 12-years-old. They&#x27;re sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn&#x27;t get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here&#x27;s a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that improvised environmental weapons are better than skipping across a timeline flowchart. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too surprised, considering that timeline flowcharts are rare and that I did illustrate t&#x27;other with multiple screenshots of Kazuma Kiryu smashing men with bicycles. Now if Kiryu had been jumping between timelines... ah, we can&#x27;t speculate, that&#x27;s not scientific. This week, I ask you to choose between cutting something unnecessary and adding something unnecessary. What&#x27;s better: quick restarts, or a diegetic HUD?

                              <span>Many are the horror games that haunt the dark, but it takes a real gift for creepy-crawlies to pull off a horror game that&#x27;s set in the light. I&#x27;m not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it&#x27;s certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It&#x27;s a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there&#x27;s that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character&#x27;s world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

                              <span>What exactly is The Alters? It&#x27;s a question I&#x27;ve been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we&#x27;ve had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn&#x27;t really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we&#x27;ve heard precious little about it since. 
Happily, I&#x27;ve now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you&#x27;ll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that&#x27;s slowly enveloping the planet. You&#x27;ll also be venturing out onto the planet&#x27;s surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there&#x27;s the fact that, well, you&#x27;re all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you&#x27;d done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It&#x27;s a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here&#x27;s everything I learned.

                              <span>Five former Ubisoft employees, including former chief creative officer Serge Hascoët and former editoral head Tommy François, have been taken into custody by French police with regard to allegations of sexual misconduct during their time at the publisher. That&#x27;s according to an article in French newspaper Libération (via Eurogamer) which echoes allegations from French videogame union Solidaires Informatique Jeu Vidéo, posted on Xitter just this morning.

                              <span>After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don&#x27;t take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won&#x27;t seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO&#x27;s movement and gunplay.
Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I&#x27;m confident Valve have an FPS that&#x27;ll supersede CS:GO in time.

Shortly after announcing plans to make the four-player PvE shooter less online-dependent, the developers have revealed that they&#x27;re also reworking Payday 3&#x27;s much-reviled progression system.

                              <span>I&#x27;m close to being whatever the Assassin&#x27;s Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.
Assassin&#x27;s Creed hasn&#x27;t been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it&#x27;s more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.

                              <span>Naughty Dog, developers of Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection and The Last Of Us: Part 1, are cutting back on contract developers. According to a report on Kotaku, the studio is cutting contracts short for at least 25 developers, with most having worked in quality assurance.

The news comes amid a period of layoffs in the game industry, which has included cuts at Team17 and Creative Assembly in the UK, as well as 830 people at Epic and Mediatonic.

                              <span>When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was &quot;They stole our idea!&quot;
Of course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. 
And so it falls to me to tell you that if you don&#x27;t have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren&#x27;t, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. 
This critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply.

In addition, the archive&#x27;s database has gained interest from AI developers and LLM teams too.

The BeStreamWise portal opens with the statement “Illegal Streams Let Criminals In&quot; and even has its own fake IPTV service called MalStreams.  The campaign is being orchestrated by Sky, Premier League, FACT, ITV, CrimeStoppers, and the UK Intellectual Property Office, among others.

When I played Super Mario Bros. Wonder in August, I came away extremely impressed by the creativity at play with the series&#x27; return to the 2D side of the coin. I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

We&#x27;ve been covering it for a few weeks now as part of Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive cover story coverage – check out our Mirage hub here for exclusive features, interviews, previews, and more – but everyone can play the game starting October 5. 
Ahead of its release, we spoke to famed actor Shohreh Aghdashloo about her role as Basim&#x27;s mentor, Roshan, in Mirage, what the experience was like, what she wants players to take away from Roshan, and so much more. We also spoke to Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub and Mirage narrative director Sarah Beaulieu and you can check that out here.

In the 11 years since the last 2D game launched, we&#x27;ve received multiple re-releases, two Super Mario Maker titles, two mainline 3D titles, and even a mobile auto-runner. After nearly two decades of the New Super Mario Bros. series dominating the 2D side of the iconic franchise, Super Mario Bros. Wonder represents a new era for the Mushroom Kingdom crew. To celebrate the impending release of this new 2D adventure on Switch, Super Mario Bros. Wonder graces the cover of our latest issue of Game Informer.

                              <span>Earlier this year, developer Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Games revealed that it was bringing its Batman: Arkham trilogy to the Switch this fall. This collection does not include Batman: Arkham Origins (a great game), which was developed by Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal. The Batman: Arkham Trilogy, as the Switch collection is called, was due out this month on October 13 but has now been delayed to December. 
More specifically, Batman: Arkham Trilogy hits Swtich on December 1. As for why, the team says more time is needed on its development. 
&quot;More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch,&quot; Rocksteady&#x27;s statement on Twitter reads. &quot;We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience.&quot;

The layoffs reportedly began last week, according to two of Kotaku&#x27;s sources and various departments, from art to production, were hit. The majority of those laid off were in Naughty Dog&#x27;s quality assurance testing department. 
The 25 contract developers laid off were part of a downsizing at the studio, but Kotaku reports that full-time staff do not appear to be affected. The publication&#x27;s sources say severance is not being offered to those laid off and those affected (as well as those still working at Naughty Dog) are &quot;being pressured to keep the news quiet.&quot;

                              <span>The Forest Cathedral is an environmental thriller that hit Xbox Series X/S and PC earlier this year in March. Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. 
For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson&#x27;s investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is &quot;a dramatic reimagining of Carson&#x27;s environmental science book, Silent Spring.&quot; 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players &quot;will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.&quot; 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the &quot;Little Man&quot; inside the 2D world of Rachel&#x27;s scanning tools. It&#x27;s in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes&#x27; latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it&#x27;s gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20.

It garnered a lot of attention, especially from those Soulslike players who were patiently awaiting a team to create an underwater one where you play as a crab. Now, you can check out Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure for yourself with a new Steam demo that goes live tomorrow, October 3. 
The studio says this demo will feature two explorable areas: The Moon Caves, which is Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure&#x27;s tutorial area, and The Expired Grove. 
In our Steam Demo, you&#x27;ll explore TWO different areas:

                              <span>Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
