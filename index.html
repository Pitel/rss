Niantic has announced that this year&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day event in Pikmin Bloom is going to be all about Clover Decor. Yep, this means that you will be able to grow Pikmin with clovers on their heads (four-leaf ones if you&#x27;re lucky) and start celebrating all things green from 1st March 2023.
The event is being split into two different parts this year, with the first section consisting of 30 different missions that you will need to complete to get your virtual hands on a packet of Gold Seedlings (required for the growth of red, yellow, blue, purple, white, winged, or rock Clover Decor Pikmin). These Clover Pikmin will be important for the second part of the event, so you&#x27;ll want to get as many of them ready as you can in the early days.

Nintendo&#x27;s recent Direct broadcast was arguably one of its best - with news like a release date for Pikmin 4, a shadow drop of Metroid Prime and another look at Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. One other exciting announcement was the reveal of Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles for the Switch Online library.
Now, following this announcement, Nintendo has updated its official Switch Online &#x27;overview trailer&#x27; - highlighting what members have access to when they subscribe to this service. The noticeable update in the latest version of this video is a brief mention of the Game Boy library - including a look at Tetris.

                              <span>Buffet of games
There wasn’t exactly a buffet of games for Nintendo’s Super Scope. It was only supported from ‘92 until ‘94, receiving 14 titles if you’re being generous and 12 titles if you’re being slightly less generous. Of them, a lot are missable. The one that usually comes to mind for anyone not intimately familiar with the shoulder rod is Yoshi’s Safari, but those in the know are aware of Battle Clash and its sequel Metal Combat: Falcon’s Revenge.
Both games were developed by Intelligent Systems exclusively for Nintendo’s grey wrapping-paper tube. Mario may have got all the attention for his unhinged rampage, but it was the mechs that showed what the space bazooka could do.

Instead, Mangamura&#x27;s demise led to an explosion of sites and even more piracy. Publishers face significant challenges but with the entertainment industries and government now on board, Japan&#x27;s systematic fight against piracy applies to all content, everywhere.

                              <span>The world received some very sad news earlier today when we learned that legendary English football commentator John Motson, whose career spanned decades (and included very long stints in video games), had passed away at the age of 77.

The final demo for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is finally available. Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja&#x27;s action RPG has its final demo out now, ahead of its launch next week.
The Wo Long demo is live now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms. Save progress will carry over into the full game, and for those too busy to hop in this weekend, the demo won&#x27;t go away when the game launches. The final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo is slated to stay live through March 26.
Included in the final demo are Chapter 1: Village of Calamity and Chapter 2: Two Chivalrous Heroes. Starting here won&#x27;t just net you an easy on-ramp to the full game, but also a reward in the &quot;Crouching Dragon Helmet&quot; item.
Alongside the demo release, you can also get a glimpse of Team Ninja&#x27;s new action-RPG here in the brand-new launch trailer here:

A fight for the kingdom
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty heads to the Three Kingdoms era, so fans of Dynasty Warriors or other virtual adaptations will feel right at home. This is, however, Team Ninja tackling the action.
Considering the trajectory Team Ninja has struck with Nioh, it seems we can expect more fantasy and some punishing swordplay.
Luckily for fans of Team Ninja&#x27;s work, Wo Long looks to have held up in all of our early looks at the game. As Chris noted in a recent preview, it&#x27;s ticking all the right boxes, even if it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.
With today&#x27;s demo, you&#x27;ll get at least a chance to see whether you&#x27;re up for it ahead of the full game. And hey, if you end up liking it, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty arrives on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC next week on March 3.

The curtain has fallen on the 2023 DICE Awards. And if you were paying attention to all the end-of-year awards as they&#x27;ve rolled out, the outcome may not be too surprising.
The awards, hosted by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, had its membership base of over 30,000 industry members vote on the various categories. Elden Ring walked away with five of them, while God of War Ragnarok snatched seven.
It wasn&#x27;t just their night, though. Other hits from 2022, including Tunic and Vampire Survivors, got some recognition. And Double Fine Productions&#x27; Tim Schafer was recognized for his contributions to the industry with the Hall of Fame award. If you want to learn more about that, I can&#x27;t recommend the recently released PsychOdyssey documentary abou…</span>

My trip to the Mun is going to have to wait. Kerbal Space Program 2 has finally been released into Early Access, and my experiences with it thus far are pretty poor, to say the least. Despite this – and I want to get this out of the way off the hop – I’m optimistic it’s going in the right direction.
Kerbal Space Program is a game that either needed an overhaul or at least a clean-up. While Steam has me clocked at over 250 hours in the first KSP, a lot of it was done before the campaign was added. Once that hit, the whole game lost its magic for me. I wasn’t content grinding for science points just to regain parts that I’d grown accustomed to. The budgetary responsibilities were just a needless barrier. However, I wanted a managerial meta-game.

It&#x27;s F-F-F-Friday, so it&#x27;s time to take a look at the next title that Epic Games Store will be offering up to its customer base free of charge — Next week, you&#x27;ll be looking to get your entrepreneurial hat on, with the arrival of tycoon simulation Rise of Industry, available to download from March 2.
Released in 2019 and developed by the delightfully named Dapper Penguin Studios, Rise of Industry tasks the player with building and maintaining a thriving industrial economy, set against the backdrop of the money-busting 1930s. The player will be required to micro-manage a number of key factors of industry, from sourcing the raw materials, to building factories and warehouses, to implementing shipping routes and securing trade agreements with other towns, cities, and countries.

Of course, you are not the only ambitious entrepreneur on the block, and you must ensure that your rivals don&#x27;t pull the rug out from underneath you, as you adapt to changing climates, offer competitive rates and deals, and ensure the speedy manufacture and delivery of over 150 different products. Rise of Industry features several scenarios with which to test your mandate mettle, or an endless sandbox mode with which the player can build, expand, and modernize their empire at will. With easy-to-learn mechanics and myriad management features, this looks to be a title to keep the ol&#x27; noodle occupied well into the wee small hours.
Rise of Industry will be able to download from Epic Games Store from March 2 until March 9. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Duskers, before its removal on Wednesday.

It would be easy, they said.
Pikachu is the surprise 7-Star challenge in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet this weekend. Similar to past 7-Star events, completing this fight awards a unique Pikachu with the Mightiest Mark title that can be obtained once per save file. Additionally, Pikachu will always sport the same moveset and Water Tera-Type, so a winning strategy should theoretically work every time. Otherwise, this encounter is a good way to obtain rare materials like Ability Patches and Bottle Caps that drop exclusively in Tera Raids. On paper, anyway.
See, when Pikachu was announced as the next 7-Star encounter, people treated it like a joke. It was assumed this would be a relatively easy event to celebrate Pokemon Day, and we’d get our real raid challenge lat…</span>

As Bungie gears up to release Destiny 2: Lightfall on February 28, the developer has collaborated with accessory designer SteelSeries on a limited edition collection of peripherals themed around Lightfall and its new city of Neomuna.
For Guardians wanting the optimal experience for learning the powers of the new Darkness subclass Strand, SteelSeries has added the Arctis 7+ headset, Aerox 5 wireless mouse, QCK Prism XL RGB mousepad as well as some performance thumbstick toppers for Xbox and PlayStation controllers.

                              <span>Nintendo says the show doesn&#x27;t fit into its plans
Nintendo is confirming reports that it will not be attending E3 2023. Today, the company says the event doesn&#x27;t fit into its plans for the year.
&quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans,&quot; said Nintendo in a statement, via IGN. &quot;Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.&quot;
IGN previously reported that Nintendo, alongside Sony and Microsoft, would not be attending this year&#x27;s E3. Xbox will be hosting its own event in Los Angeles, but it won&#x27;t be on the E3 show floor in the Los Angeles Convention Center.
The state of E3 2023
With its June date closing in, the question remains of which companies will be at E3 2023. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot had said the publisher would be at E3 if the show happened, with the company later clarifying that it does seem set to attend.
The overall wariness is notable, though. It might just be an issue of timing; Nintendo will have launched Tears of the Kingdom already by June, leaving just Pikmin 4 left on the docket. Sony hasn&#x27;t been part of E3 for years now. But that does raise the question: who will be at E3 2023?
Hopefully we find out soon, as June isn&#x27;t getting any farther away.

For one week, the all-women GDQ spin-off community will offer up over 75 speedruns on a wide variety of titles, old and new. Players from across the globe will gather online to smash through awesome titles including modern classics, such as Gris, Death&#x27;s Door, and Tunic; veteran speedrun franchises such as Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., and Silent Hill; and a fistful of retro games including Phantasy Star II, Super Metroid, and Tetris: The Grand Master.

Arc System Works has announced that it will be holding an open beta test for its upcoming Xbox and PC (Microsoft Store) ports of crossover anime scrapper BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. Players on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC can check out the fighter&#x27;s dynamic action from March 2 through March 5.
The beta test will offer up all of the modes from the 2018 release, from Training and Online Vs, to Story and Survival modes, and even the gallery and replay features. In addition, the entire roster of characters will be unlocked and available, for a staggering 53 playable heroes and villains, pulled from a variety of franchises including Persona, RWBY, Under Night In-Birth, Senran Kagura, and, of course, BlazBlue itself.

All Xbox and PC owners are eligible to take part, and you do not need and Xbox Live Gold account. Arc System Works will use the playtime in order to test the connectivity of the servers, ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch at some point in the coming months. While the world of BBCTB has been somewhat subdued recently, it remains a great title, packed out with fantastic and unique characters. If you&#x27;re yet to take it for a spin, mark your calendars for next weekend and be sure to have at it.
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle launches on Xbox and Microsoft Store this spring. It is available now on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Steam platforms.

As part of last night&#x27;s Sony State of Play presentation, Capcom offered up a new trailer for its upcoming scrapper sequel Street Fighter 6, rounding out the cast of 18 World Warriors that will be launching with the title come June 6 — As part of the new preview, we got our very first in-game look at the initial roster&#x27;s final newcomer, Lily.
Hailing from Mexico, Lily is a young and spritely fighter, whose small stature and cute appearance belies a power that has been honed through the ages. Lily is a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the very same community that has previously brought us Street Fighter veteran T. Hawk. And, as such, Lily is at one with herself, with nature, and with the ecology of the planet itself, traveling the globe and surmount…</span>

Octopath Traveler 2 is finally here, devoid of the three-hour time limit that impeded us before. I said it was looking like a treat for RPG fans, and I remain confident in that assertion.
Octopath Traveler 2 is much more than another dose of the first game. While commonalities are here (for better or for worse), there are many new skills and secrets that firmly break the mold set by Octopath Traveler. In fact, you could miss some crucial features if you intend to play this exactly like its predecessor. Octopath Traveler 2’s open ended structure is all about the joy of discovery, so you don’t have to follow a perfect path to enjoy the game. Still, if you like to optimize your progress (since you play RPGs and clicked this article, I’m guess…</span>

Rocksteady is a fantastic developer, make no bones about it, and I&#x27;ll gladly argue that we might never get a comic-book adaptation in gaming to rival the immersions, emotion, and raw, genre-defining impact of the amazing Batman: Arkham trilogy — But last night&#x27;s gameplay overview of the studio&#x27;s long, long in development Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League left me and others in the gaming community less than enthused.
Spotlit as the centerpiece of the Sony State of Play presentation Suicide Squad received a brand new trailer, as well as a more in-depth gameplay overview, showing off the characters, mechanics, and hook of the &quot;Good-to-be-Bad&quot; comic book adventure. Unfortunately, while the title undoubtedly featured some great visuals, cool character design…</span>

It looks like NetherRealm&#x27;s next project has been officially confirmed as Mortal Kombat 12, and in a bit of an unconventional way: during an earnings call.
Speaking on an earnings call today, Warner Bros. head David Zaslav confirms that Mortal Kombat 12 is in the works. The comment arrived during a section where Zaslav was discussing the success of gaming efforts under WB:
&quot;[...] And there&#x27;s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.&quot;

The mention of Mortal Kombat 12 comes as a bit of a surprise as, well, that hasn&#x27;t really been talked about up to this point. We&#x27;ve heard rumors that NetherRealm Studios was forgoing a new Injustice entry to keep the MK train going, and even seen some teases from Ed Boon on the matter, but nothing official had been confirmed prior to today&#x27;s call. Now, it looks like a new Mortal Kombat isn&#x27;t just on the way, but for this year too.
We&#x27;ve reached out to Warner Bros. for clarification, and will share more as we learn more.
Cue the Mortal Kombat theme
It hasn&#x27;t been too long since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 in 2019. The entry brought the time-hopping adventures of the rebooted MK universe to a neat close, but NetherRealm continued to update Mortal Kombat 11 afterwards with both the Aftermath story and the Ultimate edition. There&#x27;s a blank slate open for the future of the story, at least.
Add on the fact that Mortal Kombat reclaimed a main stage spot for this year&#x27;s Evo fighting game tournament series, and you could definitely retroactively justify some red-yarn-conspiracy. Still, to have Mortal Kombat 12 dropped so casually in an earnings call? It certainly doesn&#x27;t make for a boring news day. Hopefully we&#x27;ll see more soon about what NetherRealm&#x27;s up to with this new Mortal Kombat.

When it was released in 2021, Perfect Gold was something of a surprise to me. It was a yuri visual novel that I connected with, even though I’ve never exactly had any relatable experiences. Perfect Gold was earnest, honest, and sweet. It was a story of people who shared a romance, not about a romance between two people.
So, I kept the developer, Yangyang Mobile, earmarked to watch out for. I believe they were, at the time, already working on Saint Maker, and I didn’t know what to respect. As it turns out, we have a different genre, different themes, and a different writer, but the same earnestness tucked away inside.
I’ll take it.

Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
Episode 3 - Terror Dactyl 
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
&quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.&quot;
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a traditional booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate booth with demos where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn&#x27;t returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3&#x27;s success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently launching this year, and that news was revealed rather unceremoniously in an earnings call with Warner Bros. Discovery.
In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.</span>

                              <span>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2011 and is remembered fondly as a Kirby that relied less on gimmicks and felt like a fun throwback to the pink vacuum&#x27;s original adventures. Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at the Switch remaster of the game, which adds new content and abilities. You can also find Brian Shea&#x27;s full review of the game right here.

                              <span>Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero&#x27;s journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can&#x27;t tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate&#x27;s cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it&#x27;s not a pair of boots, you&#x27;re not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that&#x27;s incredibly refreshing.

                              <span>Jank. I am saying &quot;jank&quot; several times upfront, not because Spacebourne 2 is particularly janky, but because it is a bit, and I want to temper your expectations so you&#x27;re not unfair on its flaws if you try it after I bang on for the rest of this article about how impressive it is.
There&#x27;s a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn&#x27;t the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

                              <span>“At some point,&quot; says Joel Jordan, &quot;Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

                              <span>Capcom revealed three more fighters coming to Street Fighter 6&#x27;s roster last night: big lad Zangief, Union Jack-wearing Cammy and newcomer Lily, a descendant of T. Hawk&#x27;s famous Thunderfoot tribe. Before we talk about anything else, though, can we please just take a moment to appreciate Zangief&#x27;s enormous bod? The Street Fighter wrestler was always a force to be reckoned with in earlier games, but holy heck, I bet you could fit four Marcus Fenixes into those biceps and still have room left over for his son and fellow Gears Of War slab JD. Come and see what I mean in the new trailer below.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator was already impressive at launch, using satellite data and some streaming tech to recreate the entire globe. Since launch, the team have been diving in to touch up certain areas giving Australia, Japan, Canada, and more big makeovers. Now, MS Flight Sim has its sights on the magical realm of Middle-Earth, also known as New Zealand. World Update 12, out today, is sprucing up New Zealand’s vistas, adding in nine handcrafted airports, and introducing a bunch of missions.

Duskers is a roguelikelike sci-fi horror survival game about salvaging supplies from derelict spaceships using drones, seeing through their sensor readouts and issuing commands by typing into a console. Oh, by the way, there&#x27;s a reason why all these spaceships are now empty. Well, mostly empty.

                              <span>The difference between game and film reveals has always been funny to me. Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

                              <span>I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it&#x27;s the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I&#x27;m not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

                              <span>I am extremely sympathetic to professionals complaining about celebritites horning in on their turf, but I will make an exception in the case of J.K. Simmons voicing video game villains. Portal&#x27;s Cave Johnson remains one of the greatest turns in video game voice acting history, and we can now look forwards to Simmons playing a well evil, invincible necromancer in Larian Studios&#x27; RPG Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - which, incidentally, is releasing into 1.0 form on August 31st. Fair play to &#x27;em: they said August, and August it is. A new trailer featuring Simmons&#x27; character Kehteric Thorm, and the release date, was showcased at Sony&#x27;s State Of Play event last night.

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League got a lengthy demonstration at tonight&#x27;s PlayStation State Of Play event, which clarified several things about what kind of game Rocksteady&#x27;s long-awaited return to the DC Universe really is. It turns out it&#x27;s a game with lots of floaty air combat, lots of noise, lots of loot and gear scores and weapon classes, and with a battle pass (but for cosmetics only). Plus there will be DLC to add new characters post-launch.

                              <span>The only way is Easy Mode.
Just like any franchise that’s been going as long as it has, Digimon video games have had plenty of ups and downs. Digimon World: Next Order was first released in 2016 for the PlayStation Vita, with a PlayStation 4 release making its way to the West the following year. Since then, it has enjoyed enough of a cult following that it has now been ported to PC and Switch years later. Perhaps owing to its origins on Sony’s handheld console, it feels right at home on the Switch but Digimon World: Next Order is still a title that struggles to find its footing.
The opening of the game throws players into a tense battle between two highly evolved Digimon companions and a powerful opponent that serves as a tutorial for the combat system. Fights play out in real-time, with the player’s partners acting on their own initiative, based on which of the three pre-set AI behaviours you&#x27;ve chosen for them. Players can choose specific actions for them to take, but only if they have accrued enough Order Points through the course of the fight.

Nintendo has officially confirmed that it will not be attending E3 2023, following IGN&#x27;s report earlier this year.

Outright Games has unveiled a brand new gameplay trailer DC&#x27;s Justice League: Cosmic Chaos, due for release on March 10th, 2023.
The trailer focuses on what you&#x27;ll be doing during your time with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the rest of the League, including a look at combat, collectibles, costume options, and puzzle-solving. It&#x27;s looking perfectly pleasant and should prove a great introduction to the DC universe for younger gamers.

Beloved RPG Tales of Symphonia&#x27;s recent remaster should&#x27;ve been met with applause from Tales series fans, but instead, the Switch version in particular has drawn some criticism for the various technical issues. And Bandai Namco is aware of them (via Abyssal Chronicles).
In a series of tweets, the official Japanese Tales series Twitter account acknowledged that there are &quot;currently problems&quot; with the Switch version in particular — which happens to be the highest-selling version of the game in Japan. The developer also confirms that &quot;we are currently investigating on a fix&quot; (thanks to Abyssal Chronicles&#x27; a745 for translating).

PixelHeart is bringing Brazilian developer Statera Studio&#x27;s run-and-gun game Guns N&#x27; Runs to Switch on 31st March.
With eight different characters to pick from, and each having their own unique story, Guns N&#x27; Runs demands precision platforming as your run, jump, dash, and shoot your way through multiple levels. It also looks pretty cute, too — we can imagine playing this on a GBA or DS with the lovely hand-drawn pixel graphics.

Flying over from mobile back in 2021, we were impressed with how at home Sky: Children of the Light immediately felt on Switch. Now two years on from this port, thatgamecompany is still managing to add new content to the game, the most recent of which has just landed in the ver. 0.20.5 update.
This latest patch has all the usual bug fixes and improvements alongside the continuation of the in-game Season of Remembrance, fresh features in Shared Spaces and the reintroduction of the Days of Bloom event for 2023.

                              <span>Eighth time&#x27;s a charm.
It&#x27;s time lose yourself in the lush world of HD-2D all over again — Octopath Traveler II is out today on Switch (and PS4, PS5, and PC of course). Announced only last September, this surprise sequel does everything a follow up should do — it improves on every single aspect of the original while also staying faithful to it.
The premise, for instance, is exactly the same as the first Octopath Traveler — before you even dive into the world of Solistia, you need to choose your starting character, the character who will lead your party. And just like in the first game, you can&#x27;t take out your first character until you&#x27;ve completed their entire story. So choose wisely!

Publisher Burning Planet has revealed Molly Medusa: Queen of Spit, a 3D action-adventure game that appears to pay homage to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&#x27;s classic puzzle and sailing mechanics.
Launching on the Switch on April 20th, 2023, the game stars the titular Molly Medusa whose friends have seemingly all turned to stone (are you sure this isn&#x27;t your fault, Molly..?). She&#x27;ll be setting sail across a vast desert, battling deadly enemies, solving puzzles, and collecting heart pieces.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.
Today, Gavin nominates Fire Emblem Fates, a full retail release that&#x27;s disappearing from sale on Tuesday 28th February 2023, a month earlier than the rest of the eShop, due to its unique setup...

It was right at the end of 2022 that we were hit with the news that Ash Ketchum and Pikachu would be leaving the Pokémon animated series for good after 25 years of service. The new protagonists, Liko and Roy, were quickly announced, but we couldn&#x27;t help but feel a certain Pikachu-shaped hole left in our hearts. Fortunately, it looks like that sense of loss won&#x27;t be around for long.
The Pokémon Company has today taken to Twitter to reveal two new characters for the upcoming animated series and it looks like Pikachu is going to be replaced by... another Pikachu.

There is little argument that Switch has become one of the premier consoles for 3D platformers. From a host of classics from the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64, to incredible brand new experiences, like Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and brilliant indies such as Lunistice, there is a 3D platformer out there for everyone. With the extremely high bar on Switch already set, it is only natural to be interested in how new faces in the genre compare. Enter Clive ‘N’ Wrench, an indie title that has been in development for well over a decade. Despite the initially promising reveal, it pains us to say that the final release is a disappointing, broken mess that you should stay away from on Switch.
The story of Clive ‘N’ Wrench begins with Professor Nancy, a genius scientist who has built a time travel machine out of a refrigerator from the 1950s. After her blueprints were stolen by the nefarious Dr. Daucus, Nancy tasks the titular protagonists to travel through time to retrieve her blueprints from the evil doctor. The plot is a simple excuse to travel across various time-themed worlds, but serves well for the type of game this is. It is, however, the execution where the major problems with Clive ‘N’ Wrench begin to show.

A remake of Wii&#x27;s Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land (or Kirby&#x27;s Adventure Wii as fans will know it in Europe and Australia), the game launched on Switch on 24th February 2023.

                              <span>The next game from the developers of Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite is called Humanity, and it&#x27;s an action-puzzle game in which you control a Shiba Inu and try to guide crowds of people around obstacle-strewn greybox levels. A bit like Lemmings, maybe, but presumably with a surprising emotional resonance. Watch the trailer below.

And cor, I&#x27;ve never seen such love for individual expansions and total conversion mods among mainline RTS games and 4Xs. As with all strategy games, however, there can only be one victor - and you can find out what that single strategy game to rule them all is right here. Here are your 50 favourite strategy games of all time, as voted for by you, the RPS readership.

                              <span>There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

                              <span>You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

                              <span>The devs behind Command &amp; Conquer Remaster are releasing their The Great War: Western Front on March 30th, but for now they’re showing off exactly how the WW1 RTS works in a new developer diary. The ‘Commanding The Western Front’ video has several leads devs from Petroglyph walking us through aspects of the campaign, from the macro decisions of Field Commander Mode, to the  tactical RTS skirmishes in Theatre Mode.

                              <span>This week on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast our interest was piqued by new trailers for a Jesus simulator and a politics in hell strategy game. We ask ourselves: why are there so many hell-themed games and so few heavenly ones? Is it blasphemy? What would our pitch for a game set in heaven be? (Spoilers for that last one: there&#x27;s a lot of admin involved). We also chat about what we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and Nate orchestrates a mini-game pitchathon that goes at least somewhat off the rails.

                              <span>My backlog is practically overflowing at this point, hence my New Year&#x27;s resolution to avoid buying a game until I’d actually play it. But, every now and then, an especially deep discount will catch my eye, my bad impulses wake up, and I spend a few quid on something I won’t touch for six months (seriously, Abzu has been floating on my hard drive for years.) My New Year&#x27;s resolution won’t hold out for much longer, as Valve have announced their schedule for all of 2023’s Steam Fests and sales events.

                              <span>Warhammer 40k: Darktide seemed like a recipe for certain success when it launched late last year. Developers Fatshark were taking the formula established in their co-op horde shooters Vermintide, throwing in some beefy melee, and moving it over to the 40k universe. Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

Less great is that it still runs like concrete on PC, even after a performance-focused patch that developers Omega Force had detailed even before the game had formally released.

That&#x27;s the best laptop I&#x27;ve seen at this price as of late, and while this laptop is designed more for work than play, its integrated RX Vega graphics are still capable of playing older titles. 
The MagicBook 16 initially debuted at £849.99 (and still costs that much on Amazon UK), and has since dropped to £549.99. To get today&#x27;s £499.99 price, use code AGOBEYOND50 at the checkout.

The long-delayed release of Goodbye, Volcano High is finally upon us. As part of Sony’s February 2023 State of Play, KO_OP has revealed that its doors will open on June 15, 2023.
Dropping along with this bit of news is a trailer that shows us some of the dramatic tension our dinosaur teens are going to get into. Goodbye, Volcano High wraps your typical high school stories of relationships, rock bands, and the impending demise of civilization into a narrative game that is also showing off some of its rhythm game chops.

I haven’t been paying too much attention to Goodbye, Volcano High, but it’s looking pretty good to me. I like the aesthetic, I like the music, and I like rhythm games. My only issue is that some of the imagery and dialogue remind me of my high school experience, which was a horrific parade of trauma that I’m still sweeping up after. Please excuse me while I go dry heave up all my latent anxiety for a moment.
Goodbye, Volcano High is coming to PS4, PS5, and PC on June 15, 2023.

                              <span>VR, fighting, adventuring, and some superhero co-op
Sony has just wrapped its first State of Play for 2023, showing off what&#x27;s in store for the PlayStation 5 and its newly released PlayStation VR2 headset. There were some usual suspects, but also a decent number of pleasant surprises.
From the release date and console debut of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 to that wild, wacky-looking new Enhance game, there were definitely a few reveals that caught us off guard. Other parts of the State of Play were a little more what you&#x27;d expect, but even then, I&#x27;m not going to turn my nose up at more Street Fighter 6 footage, especially with both Zangief and Cammy looking fantastic in the new entry.
Here&#x27;s all the news to know from today&#x27;s show.

As part of Sony’s State of Play, Capcom dropped a trailer showing off some more Street Fighter 6 characters in action. All of these characters were part of the art leak, so try and look surprised.
[embed]https://youtu.be/8AM3PfmG1tk[/embed]
First up, we have veteran Zangief. This wrestleman will be a welcome sight to anyone who likes to roll their joystick around. Also, anyone who has an appreciation for chest hair. The trailer shows off his spinning lariats, drop kicks, and ridiculous piledriver.
Next up is Lily. Hailing from Mexico, Lily is one of the new characters for the series. She’s a lot more subdued than the raging Russian. She calls on the spirit of the wind but then also blinds Blanka with a camera.
Finally, there’s Cammy, who has decided to show up in more than just a bathing suit. She also comes equipped with a wide selection of kicks, including her signature Cannon Drill.
Street Fighter 6 arrives June 2, 2023, for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

As part of Sony’s State of Play stream, Capcom has announced the demo for the Resident Evil 4 remake. It’s “coming soon.”
Along with it is a new trailer that showcases a lot of Resident Evil 4’s zanier moments. It shows off a lot of familiar scenes from the classic title with all the modern flourishes. We also hear from characters like Luis Sera, Ramon Salazar, and Jack Krauser. There&#x27;s some minecart riding, villain taunting, and gunfighting fun. There&#x27;s also a bunch with Ashley, as it looks like you&#x27;ll not only protect her but also play some portions as her.

The Resident Evil 4 remake is arriving March 24, 2023 for PS4, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The demo is presumably coming before that.

Larian Studios has locked in a firm launch date for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and a new platform too. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 arrives on August 31 for PC, Mac, and now, PlayStation 5.
Revealed as part of today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, the latest RPG from Larian is getting a console version to coincide with the 1.0 PC launch on August 31. We had previously known the window for Larian&#x27;s exit from Early Access, but now we have a firm date, alongside the platforms for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s launch.

Today&#x27;s trailer spotlights General Ketheric Thorm, a necromancer leading an army of undead horrors towards Baldur&#x27;s Gate. As Larian shares in its blog, Thorm is not the main antagonist of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, but one of three main antagoni…</span>

As part of the State of Play today, the next game from Res Infinite developer Enhance was announced with a May 2023 window. Humanity looks like an abstract mix of Pikmin and Lemmings.

In Humanity, you play as a dog-thing that leads an absolute fleet of generic humans through geometric stages. The trailer showed off obstacles such as water, fans, and even opposing fleets of humans. On top of the adventure included in the game, you’re able to create and share your own levels.
The whole aesthetic reminds me of PS2-era Japanese games. It’s an abstract gameplay-first concept that you rarely see in the mainstream. Humanity is coming to PS4 PS5 sometime in May and as support for both versions of PSVR. A demo for it will be dropping today.

                              <span>Rev up those VR headsets
Both Nintendo and Xbox have broken the seal on 2023, and now it&#x27;s PlayStation&#x27;s turn. Today, Sony is airing its first PlayStation State of Play for 2023.
The stream goes live at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT on the PlayStation streaming channels. You can also watch via the embed below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GGkP6D5lJcw
The show is expected to have a decent number of announcements, ranging from virtual reality to indies and big, blockbuster games. So what are we looking forward to for this particular stream?
The state of play in 2023
Sony has already pretty well-established that this is going to be a stream laden with third-party news. The headliner is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and we&#x27;re expecting to see a chunk of gameplay for the upcoming Rocksteady game. Given its new release date is just a few months away, this should hopefully lock the date in for good.
PlayStation VR2 is also set to play a big role in today&#x27;s stream. Five games coming to PS VR2 later this year are going to get shown off. While hopes are high that some big names may make a console debut, it&#x27;s probably worth keeping expectations in check for what Sony will show for its brand-new headset.
Lastly, we are also going to get &quot;new looks&quot; at anticipated games from third-party partners. There are a number of usual suspects that have made previous PlayStation stream appearances and are due to launch this year, like Street Fighter 6 and Final Fantasy XVI. Plus, never discount a little indie surprise.
Today&#x27;s stream is, much like the Xbox Developer Direct and Nintendo Direct, a tone-setter going forward. 2023 still feels a bit uncertain for Sony&#x27;s console aside from Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, but today we&#x27;ll hopefully see some updates on what the future holds, both for PS5 and its brand-new VR headset.

                              <span>A notebook and a highlighter set
[Update: Well, &quot;soon&quot; ended up being three months! You can find both of the below rewards on this My Nintendo page.]
Another first part Nintendo release: another My Nintendo reward. This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.
Here&#x27;s all we know at the moment:
&quot;Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info.&quot;

The notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It&#x27;s hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.
Also, it&#x27;s very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) &quot;sell out&quot; of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The Pokémon franchise is no stranger to excellent spinoffs. Between the lauded Mystery Dungeon crossovers, the well-regarded (if seldom played) Pokkén Tournament, and, of course, the cultural juggernaut that is Pokémon GO, there&#x27;s been a Pokémon game for just about every genre imaginable. Once upon a time, there were even two excellent Pokémon pinball games.
The original Pokémon Pinball is something of an oddity, even when viewed amid the eclectic Game Boy Color library. Released three years after the first Pokémon generation in Japan, and just a few months before Pokémon Yellow arrived in North America, the game was little more than two digital pinball tables with Pokémon theming. The two tables were &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue,&quot; and they were excellent.

                              <span>Noisy Head Games’ indie-charmer Beyond the Long Night will be floating to PC on April 13, 2023.
Beyond the Long Night is a dual-stick side-scroller featuring rogue-lite elements and adventure puzzle-solving. If dual-stick side-scroller strikes you as a bit odd, the explanation is that you float around with a cluster of balloons. I still have a lot of balloon-related trauma stemming from Mario Kart and Balloon Kid, but even despite all the agonizing flashbacks, Beyond the Long Night looks like charming fun.

In Beyond the Long Night, you will explore the monster-filled Dark Mountain to discover the secrets of a corrupting force. Not unlike many roguelites, you find yourself stuck in a time-loop, but the game’s cast of colorful characters remember you throughout each one. The level is built of a randomized assortment of hand-crafted rooms, some containing puzzles.
I find the graphics to be charming in a Downwell or Cave Story sort of way. I’m not sure what it is about the gameplay, but watching through some of it was enough to put Beyond the Long Night firmly on my radar, even if I’m not necessarily a lover of roguelites.
Beyond the Long Night is coming to PC on April 13. If you’d like to get airborne before then, a demo is available on Steam.

Clear some space on the nacho cheese-stained carpet, as Wired Productions&#x27; Arcade Paradise is receiving a trio of new games today as part of its second paid DLC pack. This pack will allow you to glut up your arcade with three all-new cabinets.
The new cabinets added are R.O.G.E.R., Penguin Push, and Summer of Sports. All of these are fictional games, sometimes based on real-world classics. Penguin Push, for example, seems very similar to the original-flavored Mario Bros., and Summer of Sports smells like Konami’s Track &amp; Field series. As for R.O.G.E.R., I’m drawing a blank.

These will be joining the three games from DLC pack 1 and the licensed title Kung Fury: Street Rage, as well as the 35 games already included in the base game. Alongside them come new challenges, rewards, and leaderboards.
I was somewhat lukewarm on Arcade Paradise when I reviewed it last year. My main grievances weren’t really on the games included within, as they provided a nice variety, and I found a few that fit my tastes. It was more that the management side of things didn’t play well with the concept of having all these mini-games. I can already buy giant compilations of arcade games, but a metagame that ties it all together is something I still crave.
Arcade Paradise is available on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. DLC Pack 2 launches today, and its included cabinets are available to buy as a set or à la carte.

Independent developer Moon Studios is seemingly gambling a lot on its next release, suggesting that the performance of the unannounced new title could &quot;make or break&quot; the studio.
Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler made the stark comments on Twitter when discussing the ARPG title, which was first announced three years ago and has been in steady development since. The mystery project will not only see the studio take a break from its much beloved Ori series, but will also see Moon move away from Xbox exclusivity and into the wider world of platforms, courtesy of publisher Private Division.
&quot;Our next project is going to be a make-or-break moment for Moon,&quot; wrote Mahler on Twitter. &quot;Either we manage to revolutionize the ARPG genre or we’ll slowly…</span>

                              <span>Planning ahead for spending
Steam Sales and Fests are an opportune moment for PC owners to fill up their gaming backlog. And Valve is taking a little bit of the guesswork and speculation out of the Steam Sale schedule for 2023.
In a blog, Valve outlines the schedule for 2023 in terms of Steam Sales and Fests. The former is self-explanatory, as Steam Sales entail big, sweeping discounts throughout Valve&#x27;s digital storefront, usually with some deep cuts into price tags. Fests are themed celebrations that do usually have discounts, but also bring in some thematic celebration or even a slew of new demos for upcoming games. From genre-focused celebrations to the increasingly popular Next Fest demo onslaught, these Steam Festivals are fun spotlights into the ever-growing Steam catalog.
Whether it&#x27;s the big seasonal sales or a collection of what&#x27;s to come from smaller developers, this schedule should at least help out in knowing what&#x27;s on the way. Here&#x27;s the full 2023 lineup.
2023 Steam Sale and Fest schedule
Mystery Fest: February 20 - 27
Spring Sale: March 16 - 23
Puzzle Fest: April 24 - May 1
Sports Fest: May 15 - 22
Next Fest: June 19 - 26
Summer Sale: June 29 - July 13
Stealth Fest: July 24 - 31
Visual Novel Fest: August 7 - 14
Strategy Fest: August 28 - September 4
SHMUP Fest: September 25 - October 2
Next Fest: October 9 - 16
Return of Steam Scream Fest (Halloween): October 26 - November 2
Autumn Sale: November 21 - 28
Winter Sale: December 21 - January 4, 2024
Now you&#x27;ve got an easy way to plan ahead and make some cost-saving choices around those big events. Because really, what is a Steam Sale if not an excellent way to pile on-top of your insurmountable backlog?

It&#x27;s an interesting week for the Nintendo eShop, as a first-party release and a third-party game battle for attention. The former is of course Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe: a re-release (with extras) of the 2011 Wii entry. Then there&#x27;s Octopath Traveler II, which is a pretty huge release for Square Enix, and has a baked-in fanbase at this point. Both of those are due out on February 24.
In other news, Redemption Reapers is coming out today, and Katamari Damacy Reroll is getting a full game trial for Switch Online + Expansion Pack members until February 26 at 11:59PM PT. There&#x27;s quite a lot to mess around with! You can find the full eShop breakdown below.

If you’ve been holding off on replaying Half-Life until it gussies itself up a bit and Black Mesa doesn’t feel quite the same, you can now apply some simulated photons to it. Programmer Sultim Tsyrendashiev, the creator of similar mods for Doom, Quake, and Serious Sam, has released a literal glow-up with their Half-Life 1 Ray Traced mod. The mod does exactly what it say on the box by adding path traced illumination and reflections.
Hey, you know what? I started up Half-Life a few weeks ago for a tandem playthrough of it and Black Mesa, so this is the perfect time for me to give it a try. I had left off on the early chapter Office Complex. Installation of the mod is extremely simple, and it launches from a separate executable. Once inside, it was a few quick tweaks to th…</span>

                              <span>Competitive action RPG Dota 2 remains the second most-played game of all-time on Steam. Naturally, some of those players are cheaters. But this week Valve purged thousands of them from the platform thanks to an extremely clever little rouse: a bit of bogus game code that would only be activated by particular…

Set five years after Batman: Arkham Knight, the adventure centers on the villains turned government-mandated saviors trying to stop a global invasion by Brainiac, who has hijacked the minds of Earth’s greatest heroes.
Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play). The video presentation highlights each Squad member’s traits. Harley Quinn is the most acrobatic, sporting a grappling hook to swing across buildings. Deadshot uses a jetpack to fly or hover while using various assault weapons to riddle foes with bul…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.</span>

While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here&#x27;s a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a &quot;western sci-fi roguelike,&quot; Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you&#x27;re swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

                              <span>Sony showed a new trailer for Resident Evil 4 at the most recent State of Play live stream, and it&#x27;s great. Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he&#x27;s shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley&#x27;s sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There&#x27;s a lot more I didn&#x27;t type out because you aren&#x27;t reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

                              <span>Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion&#x27;s launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.</span>

                              <span>The mysterious population puzzle game Humanity has been shrouded in mystery since it was first announced in 2018, but today’s State of Play presentation revealed it’s coming this summer. Best of all, you can play a demo today.
The game comes from the creators of Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite and centers on controlling a dog to herd thousands of people across bizarre platforming challenges. The trailer also revealed tools to create your own levels and share them with other players. 


Humanity launches this May for PlayStation consoles, PlayStation VR and VR2, and PC via Steam. The demo is available now until March 6.</span>

                              <span>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 launched today with only a handful of proper exclusives. Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal. The recent VR remake of Resident Evil 4,…</span>

                              <span>Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn&#x27;t cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It&#x27;s unclear what Mikami will do next, but he&#x27;s leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango&#x27;s portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here&#x27;s our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we&#x27;re excited to see what&#x27;s next for the veteran designer.</span>

The Knight Witch, last year&#x27;s fun and frantic mash-up of bullet hell action and Metroidvania exploration, has just received a brand new update on Switch. Publisher Team17 has shared all of the details for the patch over on its blog.
Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team&#x27;s fast-paced action game — in our own words — &quot;mixes things up a bit&quot; and is a refreshing take on the Metroidvania genre. But we did note some technical issues, including soft locks, in our review. But, with today&#x27;s update, it looks like a lot of those early issues may well be magicked away.

                              <span>This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!

Dosud platí, že ač samotné Ubuntu vedle Deb balíčků nabízí také Snap, jiné varianty mohou libovolně podporovat Flatpak. Canonical nyní hlásí, že se s vývojáři variant s jinými desktopy dohodl na společném postupu, který znamená jediné: z výchozích konfigurací a instalací systému zmizí podpora Flatpaku.</span>

A copyright complaint sent by the MPA this week pulls no punches; these playlists facilitate piracy on a massive scale.

The focus of this patch series is on avoiding too many cross-CPU wake-ups when they are unnecessary. In doing so, these patches help enhance the Linux performance particularly on high core count systems...</span>

This time is special though, as it&#x27;s one of the best value points on the current Team Red GPU hierarchy, the RX 6700 XT, and it&#x27;s also a top-rated Asus Dual design. It was previously retailing for around £400, but now it&#x27;s dropped at Amazon to £372.54, a very reasonable price for this level of performance.

Case in point is this deal on a 27-in 1440p 165Hz gaming monitor for just £230 after a solid £135 reduction. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for this spec, which looks great and offers a competitive advantage over 60Hz alternatives.

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I talked about a number of new features coming to RPS in 2023, and here we are with our very first edition of Ask RPS! This is a new mailbag feature where RPS supporters get to pose questions to the RPS Treehouse team (mostly video games-related, though not necessarily always), and we then answer those questions in public posts for everyone to get involved with. Easy peasy.
To kick us off, our first question comes courtesy of Old_Man_Gaming, who asked: &quot;What was the first game that really grabbed you and dominated your life?&quot; 
Come and find out which games had us trapped in the throes of childhood mania below, and why not tell us about your own gaming obsessions in the comments? You might just find a surprise kindred spirit.

                              <span>Universe-spanning survival sim No Man’s Sky is releasing its 4.1 Fractal Update today, bringing along a new Expedition, tons of accessibility options, a VR overhaul, and much more. Developers Hello Games have updated the game so consistently their launch woes are a distant memory, sent to a faraway galaxy. Since then, No Man’s Sky has become a not just a space exploration game, but a city management sim and a generally nice place to chill with your odd alien pets, all in one package.

                              <span>Even after a decade marked by the abandonware crowd being proven right, there are old games that remain lost between the cracks of digital distribution. Instead of waxing lyrical about that though, I&#x27;m here today with good news: My favourite open world 3D spaceflight/trading sim Hardwar is back.
It&#x27;s been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who&#x27;ve just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims &quot;to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts&quot;. I&#x27;ll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we&#x27;d already be playing its modern descendants.

                              <span>Atomic Heart continues to dominate both my professional time and my personal brainspace; it really is a fascinating game, for reasons good and terrible alike. Its most recent twist came in the complete lack of ray tracing at launch, despite various pre-release builds having been held up by Nvidia themselves as the technology’s exemplars. Crispy critters, indeed.

There is, of course, far more to it than that. I asked Team Lazerbeam&#x27;s Ben Rausch about how it tackles themes of queer identity and diversity in a kickass way, which I highlighted in my post, but wanted to highlight even more here. Their answers were too good not to share.

NCSOFT has a history of publishing their own games worldwide, as they have done with Guild Wars in the past, so their agreement with Amazon is somewhat unique. Amazon haven’t given a release window for Throne And Liberty, but they’ll be publishing the game on PC and consoles with cross-play enabled.

                              <span>Documentaries chronicling game development are great. With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

Backpack Hero has been successful for its three-person dev team and stood apart from other roguelikes with its Tetris-inspired inventory management. You see, success in Backpack Hero is determined by how you organise your bag rather than what you’re actually carrying, as you shuffle items around a grid to create synergies and mod your playstyle.

                              <span>Paradox’s grand spacefaring strategy Stellaris is getting its fifth story pack First Contact on March 14th, following on from the previously released Leviathans, Synthetic Dawn, Distant Stars, and Ancient Relics. Story packs are mid-sized expansions that flesh out Stellaris’s universe and this time First Contact is focusing on pre-FTL civilisations, taking a step back from the stars. The expansion was officially revealed back in January after a series of SteamDB leaks outed the project.

                              <span>Introversion Software are, we can infer, at home in simulation games by now, what with their most famous game Prison Architect having a bajillion DLCs that, at this point, can add zombies, rehabilitation, or the jungle to your prison. Their new one is called The Last Starship, a layered spaceship simulator that&#x27;s less friendly than their prison. I am not sure if it&#x27;s because the early access is still largely without any tutorial markers, or because I am very bad at the game.

I thought of it again while watching the trailer for Lumencraft, which seems to marry all of the above to a fully destructible world and lots more resource gathering. It&#x27;ll leave early access on February 28th.

                              <span>Remakes can offer new creative minds the chance to inject old ideas with fresh reinventions. Dead Space is a great case study, as Motive Studios smartly updated Visceral Games’ successful template while preserving its most beloved elements (here’s our review). To learn more about how the remake came together, we had a conversation with Motive Studios’ Roman Campos-Oriola, the creative director of the Dead Space remake, to reflect on the game’s development and success. However, there’s an added twist. 
Joining the discussion is Bret Robbins, creative director of the original Dead Space. The ex-Visceral designer has beaten the remake multiple times and shares the standout elements of Motive’s version. Additionally, he reveals the limitations Visceral faced while developing the original that …</span>

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launches today, and the new VR version of Resident Evil Village alongside it. However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to visit our coverage hub to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.</span>

                              <span>Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge&#x27;s fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge &amp; Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge &amp; Blade, not to be confused with Mount &amp; Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge &amp; Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

                              <span>Survival sequel Sons Of The Forest is only a few days away as it launches into early access on February 23rd, and the team is celebrating with a final pre-release trailer, exposing us to some nasty sights. Sons Of The Forest was originally going to launch into a full 1.0 release this month, but the team ultimately decided on an early access release since it worked so well for the game’s predecessor The Forest.

Like clockwork, it happens whenever a new Yakuza (or Like A Dragon, as it&#x27;s now known) game arrives. And you know what? It gets to me. To experience the series in the richest way possible, there&#x27;s an obvious answer. But if you&#x27;re someone who hasn&#x27;t got the time to do so, or you&#x27;re a bit unsure whether Yakuza is for you, then there&#x27;s another way in. Now pick up that bike and walk with me.

All those demogoers should be pleased to hear that Terra Nil is finally launching onto PC and mobile (through Netflix) on March 28th.

The Theatrhythm series has been a standout, if criminally underplayed, example of how to both showcase a series’ excellent set of scores while celebrating a prolific franchise’s history. Since the previous entry’s release on 3DS in 2014, Final Fantasy music has evolved thanks to the releases of Final Fantasy XV, Final Fantasy XIV expansions, remakes, and more. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line folds these additions into a mix of returning classics and lesser-known tunes to create an amazing catalog of songs to play through in the series’ trademark take on th…</span>

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related. The announcement tweet states that third-party titles and indies will get a bulk of the spotlight. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.
State of Play is back! Tune in Thursday at 1pm PT for:

The event comes during a big week for Sony, as PlayStation VR2 launches on Wednesday, February 22 (check out our review of the headset here). We last saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at the Game Awards last December, where it was confirmed to launch on May 26 and will feature Kevin Conroy&#x27;s final video game performance as Batman. Perhaps we&#x27;ll get confirmation on the game&#x27;s rumored live-service elements.</span>

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There&#x27;s not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that&#x27;s an announcement we&#x27;ll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there&#x27;s plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year&#x27;s Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

                              <span>Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company&#x27;s colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. 
Since the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.&#x27; Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony&#x27;s consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. 
Now, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here&#x27;s the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: 
We’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO

Many have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with &quot;full feature and content parity.&quot; 
If I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo&#x27;s next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review.

The names of the sites appear to be a secret, so inevitably that makes them much more interesting. What we found may be bigger than naming two sites. More sites are also offline - big ones too.

That brings it to just £38.99, the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen in months and a good value for the level of quality provided.

SanDisk&#x27;s Extreme Pro lineup offers pretty much the best performance you can find in the UHS-1 Micro SD category, with read speeds up to 200MB/s and write speeds of 140MB/s, and now the massive 1TB model is down to £122 at Amazon - that&#x27;s significantly cheaper than upgrading from the base-level Steam Deck to the top-level 512GB option, yet provides double the storage, an awesome deal.

                              <span>After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic&#x27;s breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It&#x27;s a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

                              <span>Solo dev Madison Karrh’s point-and-click puzzler Birth really caught me off-guard. From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I&#x27;ve ever played.

                              <span>Last year, developer Bloober Team unveiled Layers Of Fears, the next entry in their first-person horror series. At the time it was hard to gauge if the game was a sequel, a pseudo-remake, or something in between. We now have a clearer view of what it really is ahead of its release this June, and it’s also (confusingly) changed its name back to Layers Of Fear, singular. Check out the new trailer below:

It looks like a bloody visual feast, but the bigger news is how Redfall’s open-world multiplayer is untethered, meaning a four-player squad can separate and fight bloodsuckers in different parts of the coastal town.

I imagine you&#x27;ve experienced a similar thing with video games, whenever a columnist for a broadsheet writes about them and you can instantly tell that they have never played one in their whole dahlia-manuring, boot room-having, fox hunt-following life.
Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow is a book about the decades-long relationship between two people who are game developers. And like the above, it would be impossible to explain to someone who doesn&#x27;t work in the games industry why a small exchange between the two of them made me absolutely roar with laughter.

                              <span>Atomic Heart’s long development cycle has provided ample opportunities to show off the power of ray tracing. From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.
I noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game&#x27;s press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that &quot;the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch.&quot; Well then!

It was formally announced with its very flash animated opening sequence during November&#x27;s PC Gaming Show Preview stream, but now you, too, can see what it actually looks like in motion with its very first gameplay trailer. Come and have a gander at its spaceship antics - or, if you&#x27;re like me, just watch the two full seconds of a crew member giving Ham the pig a nice big belly-rub on repeat.

                              <span>After being stranded on the original Playstation for two decades, the time-travelling sequel Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition finally made its way to PC last year. It should’ve been cause for celebration as the classic Square JRPG had never seen a European release, but technical woes plagued the modern port and dampened the party. Now a year after launch, Square is updating Radical Dreamers with a “wide range of changes” later this month.

                              <span>If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. 


Oddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.

                              <span>I’ve played a lot of strange games, but never one that lurches between greatness and bafflement as hard or as fast as Atomic Heart. It’s a fascinatingly chaotic medley of ideas, and a rare FPS that lacks even the slightest whiff of battle pass-peddling live serfdom, but those ideas so often fail to gel that it can feel like a game made by several different dev teams. For a shooter set within an alternate history Soviet Union, it could perhaps have used some more central planning.

                              <span>I see novelty games on Steam every couple of days; things like gun-wielding slime shooters, or hyper-realistic dog-walking sims. They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  


I Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. 


In fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore.

                              <span>Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. 


Lies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio&#x27;s daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.


The newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?

Metroid Prime has long been considered one of the crowning achievements of Nintendo’s GameCube library. The series’ seamless transition to the first-person genre was defined by its frenetic action, massively explorable environments, clever puzzles, and daunting boss encounters. However, the subsequent two decades have worn on the original release, but much like Samus by the end of each game, Metroid Prime Remastered brings the title back to full power.
Metroid Prime Remastered takes the already-stellar original title and gives it a shiny coat of paint. While not uniqu…</span>

                              <span>The release of the Pinocchio-inspired Soulslike Lies of P has been narrowed down to this August. A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. 
Lies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. 


The gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. 
Lies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.</span>

Akka Arrh is a reimagined version of a prototype Atari arcade machine from the ‘80s. Originally scrapped due to a lack of interest, the trailer for the re-release claims that only three cabinets have ever been seen. 40 years later, when Atari reached out to veteran designer Jeff Minter (Tempest 2000, Polybius) to remake one of its games, he chose Akka Arrh. The result is a reimagining of the original concept, fused with Minter’s signature psychedelic visuals and some modern-day improvements. While the game can…</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart has been in development for a long time. From its initial reveal, it has always been a fascinating game that looks good – maybe too good. The game is finally releasing, however, and our first impressions are strong, even if we don&#x27;t particularly like the protagonist. Join Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart for a look at a portion the game taking place about an hour into the campaign.

                              <span>Výzkumníci objevili, že populární software ChatGPT se začne chovat velmi podivně, pokud se mu na vstup napíšou konkrétní zdánlivě nesmyslná sousloví: SolidGoldMagikarp (s mezerou na začátku), TheNitromeFan, attRot a další. Buď si je poplete s úplně nesouvisejícím slovem, nečekaně skončí, nebo začne generovat nesmysly. Stejná chyba postihuje i starší verze GPT-3 a GPT-2. Ve veřejných instancích provozovaných společností OpenAI byla ale již záplatována, takže si to tam nezkusíte.</span>

                              <span>For filmmakers, it’s an incredible honor to be nominated for an Oscar. The added exposure can also lead to a profit boost for smaller releases. That comes with a downside too, however, as recent data reveal that Oscar nominations also tend to cause a spike in pirated downloads.

Happily, League Of Geeks have now added the final bit of infernal spit and polish to Solium&#x27;s first gameplay trailer, which has been shown off during IGN Fanfest this week. Come and have a gander.

                              <span>Have you ever wanted to explore new realities and compelling narratives but need that initial push? For those who wish to try something new, the developers of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate at MyDearest want to help you with a chance to win your choice of a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB).
Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate takes place in the city of Astrum Close where the crime rate is only 0.001%. Protagonist Hal Scion is a young investigator who possesses a special ability called “Memory Dive” that allows him to see into and alter the past and he uses this ability to collect evidence for investigations. When the founder of Astrum Close is found dead, Hal must take up the case in order to solve this theoretically “impossible” murder. The game is currently available on the Meta Quest 2, is launching on PlayStation VR2 on February 22nd, and launches on Nintendo Switch later this year.
One lucky winner can choose between a PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, a Nintendo Switch OLED, or a Meta Quest 2 (128 GB) to jumpstart their journey into the cyber-noir anime world of Dyschronia: Chronos Alternate.
Sweepstakes open to residents of the continental U.S. and District of Columbia ages 17 and older. Daily entry is available until 11:59 PM CST, February 26, 2023. You will be contacted via email after the close of the sweepstakes so be sure to use an email you check frequently. Full sweepstakes rules available below. Good Luck!

                              <span>When The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time arrived on Nintendo 64, it quickly became Brian&#x27;s favorite video game he ever played. However, due to a series of circumstances and several failed attempts, he never played the direct sequel, Majora&#x27;s Mask. Now, in preparation for the sequel to his current favorite game of all time, Breath of the Wild, Brian is going back and playing the sequels he missed to his favorite games of all time. The first game on that list? The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask. On this episode, Brian and Kyle chat all about playing this N64 classic in 2023.

                              <span>Jake Solomon, the director of Marvel’s Midnight Suns and the modern XCOM games, has announced his departure from Firaxis. 
Solomon has worked at Firaxis for 23 years and is best known as the lead designer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the director of XCOM 2, including its War of the Chosen expansion. He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. 
In a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.
Some of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1. He was also a great sport on our Marvel’s Midnight Suns Rapid-Fire interview. You can read our review of his final project at Firaxis, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, here.</span>

Like a Dragon: Ishin is not a new game. It&#x27;s a remake of an old game – 2014&#x27;s Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, released only in Japan on the PS3 and PS4. And yet, despite the age of its skeleton, in some ways, the game stands out as one of the more impressive games in developer Ryu Ga Gotoku&#x27;s (RGG) portfolio – even with a few noticeable weak points. 
Ishin takes place in the 1860s, at the end of Japan&#x27;s Edo period. You play as Sakamoto Ryoma – a real-life historical figure – who, amid his own revenge scheme, finds himself embroiled in the …</span>

                              <span>Tetris is a new original film coming to Apple TV+, the iPhone maker&#x27;s streaming service, and if the first trailer for it is any indication, it looks like a great time. 
Released yesterday, Tetris begins with the classic Europe song, &quot;The Final Countdown,&quot; which then aptly transitions to Korobeiniki, the main theme of Tetris (you know the one). The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton&#x27;s character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton&#x27;s character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game&#x27;s creator that he can make him a millionaire. 
Check it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: 


As you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the &quot;greatest game ever made&quot; made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. 
Tetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31.

In an age where remakes and retro-inspired projects try recreating what classic games of old felt like, Octopath Traveler II accomplishes something impressive. Despite being rooted in modern design with a host of conveniences, it effortlessly captures the spirit, style, and sense of adventure of the best RPGs from the SNES era, while still innovating and showing there’s life in turn-based battles yet. The feat is even more remarkable, considering Octopath II’s most significant changes are small and subtle.

Before the podcast wraps up, we answer listener questions about whether PSVR2 is worth its large price tag.

We also take a gander at fantasy FPS Dark And Darker, Steam&#x27;s most wishlisted &#x27;shooter&#x27;. I&#x27;m less keen on it than Hayden is.
 In the second part of the pod, we talk about the goals we&#x27;ve achieved in theHunter: Call Of The Wild, including a tale about moose and a deer that knocked me out.

                              <span>Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional &quot;summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas&quot; bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.
You know that cliché feeling of &quot;just one more turn&quot;? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into &quot;just one more game&quot;. It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It&#x27;s about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.

                              <span>I like wizards because they&#x27;re the dramatic combination of powerful, cocky, and a bit dim. Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard&#x27;s not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal&#x27;s face. Splendid chaos.

The full statement is included below.



Late last year, turn-based indie RPG The Outbound Ghost was delisted from Steam after a statement from lead dev Conrad Grindheim claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had “dissolved.” Soon after, Digerati filed a lawsuit against developer Conradical over a breach of contract and “several false defamatory” statements. When reporting on the original news, CJ thought the messy situation could get messier, and he was right. Grindheim has now DMCA’d his own game on console storefronts and accused Digerati of withholding royalties.

                              <span>I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout &quot;yosh!&quot; as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude&#x27;s head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.
Like A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin&#x27; and chicken betting that&#x27;s most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it&#x27;s not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There&#x27;s nothing here that will convert those who aren&#x27;t keen on the series, but if you&#x27;re an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.

                              <span>Magic doesn&#x27;t always need to be like, cauldrons of bubbling newts. I&#x27;d say building a romantic connection with a wrestler entirely formed of green ooze, or training your M.E.A.T. at Mrs. Muscles gym counts as magic – pure magic, even. And that&#x27;s what Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid On The Block offers. It&#x27;s a wrestling dating sim with a splash of RPG, and almost certainly a game that&#x27;ll pin your heart in a bear hug and never let go.

Venom was a villain in the base game, but he’s now transitioning into a playable antihero for the fight against Mephisto. To celebrate, the deckbuilding strategy game is free to try on Steam for the entire weekend.

Genuine question: does this make the green minions Kerbites, Kerbals, or Kermen?

That&#x27;s Octopath Traveler 2 in a nutshell, a JRPG that follows so precisely in the footsteps of its predecessor that you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking it was suddenly 2019 again and that the last few pandemic years were nothing but a terrible existential nightmare. But alas, here we are in 2023 with another Octopath Traveler game that is, bar a couple of very light tweaks and additions, exactly the same game as what came before it, for better and for worse.

Nutno dodat, že CURRENT je vývojová verze a oficiállní verze FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE by měla vyjít až v červenci 2023. Konzervativní přístup se tímto u pfSence značně mění. Přínosem jsou zcela jistě nové ovladače síťových karet. Další velkou změnou je přechod na PHP 8.1.</span>

                              <span>Earlier today we looked at the most affordable PCIe 4.0 SSD, with the Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB at $99.99, and now it&#x27;s time to look at one of the very fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs, the WD SN850x. It&#x27;s down to $99.99 for a 1TB model and $159.99 for a 2TB size, a new low price for each capacity and a great deal for our top PCIe 4.0 SSD recommendation. 
This SSD is only really rivalled by the more expensive Samsung 990 Pro, our overall &#x27;fastest SSD&#x27; recipient, with both options offering random write performance well over 1M IOPS and sequential read speeds of up to 7300MB/s, at the very limit of the PCIe 4.0 standard.

That&#x27;s a heavy reduction from its original $169.99 price point, and an awesome value for a drive that works well in PCs and even PS5s.

                              <span>Hot diggedy daffodil, am I glad I picked Casual difficulty in Veil Of Dust. Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn&#x27;t make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says &quot;it&#x27;s pretty tough - you&#x27;ve been warned&quot;. I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother&#x27;s throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).
Áine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who&#x27;ve moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It&#x27;s difficult enough that I didn&#x27;t think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn&#x27;t restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they&#x27;re simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn&#x27;t a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.

                              <span>From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.
In the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I&#x27;d actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it&#x27;s basically the same design, with all the same parts.

Coincidentally, I&#x27;ve also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I&#x27;ve realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.

The team have described the initiative as a launchpad for indies in the “rapidly growing Danish games industry and beyond.” Ghost Ship Publishing haven’t announced any games yet, but we’ll get to see their upcoming projects on March 2nd as part of Deep Rock Galactic’s fifth-anniversary livestream.

Do you know what the most delayed game ever is? Because the title recently changed hands.

                              <span>American McGee is still trying to turn his theoretical Alice: Asylum into a reality. The last game in his dark action-platformer series, Alice: Madness Returns, released more than ten years ago, and since then McGee has been funding development through a Patreon which, at the time of writing, currently has 3,192 paying members. In 2021, McGee released the first draft of a script, and now he’s back with a 414-page design bible, the announcement of a partner studio, and an odd plea to EA.

                              <span>Like a sticky ball of regurgitated sap spat from the jaws of a giant dog, review code for Wild Hearts came in hot and fast earlier this week. So while other outlets will be delivering their final verdicts on Omega Force’s beast batterin’ simulator today, I’m afraid I haven’t had the chance to play enough of it to give it a fair shakedown yet. It’s good, though! I really like it, and as a huge Monster Hunter fan I’m pleased that there’s finally a worthy alternative to Capcom’s long-running series. Competition is good!

Previously, you needed to own all three Total War: Warhammer games to play Immortal Empires, since it compiles campaign maps, war units, and Legendary Lords from across the strategy trilogy. Now, you’ll just need to own Warhammer 3 for access to the campaign.

                              <span>It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I&#x27;m trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.
I’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games&#x27; sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I&#x27;m completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.

Anti-piracy coalition ACE cooperated with the authorities to take down the piracy ring.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. 
The trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. 


Redemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game&#x27;s season pass. Firaxis&#x27; role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.</span>

                              <span>Sound design is an often overlooked and underappreciated element of many games, but it&#x27;s an element Capcom takes very seriously in Resident Evil 4. As horrific as the game looks, it&#x27;s the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game&#x27;s soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they&#x27;re making the game sound as good as it plays. 
Game Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that&#x27;s important to the team?
Hiroshi Tamura: For the remake, we wanted to pay great attention to the sound throughout the game…</span>

Wild Hearts may seem similar to Monster Hunter and other hunting genre games, but its focus on constructing gadgets in a world steeped in Japanese folklore and feudal-era Japan help it carve its own identity. Like Monster Hunter, you track big game, craft new armor and weapons, and do it all over again. But the otherworldly take on old-world Japan, filled with giant mythical beasts, is a profo…</span>

                              <span>While the other major publishers like Microsoft and Nintendo have only dabbled with virtual reality, Sony is the only one of the big three that seems to consider it a potential avenue for our video game future. The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.
PlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.

Call of the Mountain is meant to be PlayStation VR2’s showcase piece, and in some important ways, it functions as exactly that. Firing off an arrow with a bow in VR feels great, and getting a chance to see the world of Horizon from a novel perspective can be exhilarating. The primary gameplay of Call of the Mountain, however, struggles to find fun at a basic level which ultimately sours the larger experience.
Call of the Mountain features a perfunctory cameo from Aloy to remind you that you are in her world, but this gam…</span>

                              <span>Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we&#x27;re curious to see how these other projects fair and if they&#x27;ll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix&#x27;s well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

                              <span>Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it&#x27;s actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I&#x27;m not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been in development hell for years, and the fans eagerly awaiting its launch now have one less week to do so. Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.
The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it&#x27;s essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars&#x27; blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it&#x27;s coming out a week early.

                              <span>2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine&#x27;s studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2&#x27;s tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft&#x27;s acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we&#x27;re excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…</span>

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
