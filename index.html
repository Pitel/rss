                              <span>Grim Dawn has been trucking along for quite a while now, and even though we&#x27;ve had a fair selection of competent hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash ARPGs over the years, it is still near the pinnacle of its niche. And now, with update 1.2.0.0, Grim Dawn is taking its next leap forward.


This leap forward, however, is really more of a dodge, as that&#x27;s one of the most notable new features making their way into the game. As per the developer Crate Entertainment&#x27;s recent announcement, Grim Dawn is due to receive a dedicated evade ability (with invincibility frames, to boot), hugely improved level and difficulty scaling, an overhaul of all loot tables, and the streamlining of how it handles its health and mana motions. These changes are a huge shift in Grim Dawn&#x27;s meta all on their own, but they only scratch the …</span>

                              <span>Having just passed its 12th birthday, Skyrim continues to take up real estate in the AAA gaming sphere. As one of the most successful RPGs in recent memory, Bethesda&#x27;s epic Elder Scrolls game is still quite pretty, but has evidently aged over the past decade or so.


That&#x27;s where artist and YouTuber Leo Torres coming into the picture. As spotted by DSO Gaming, Torres has recently uploaded a new video showing what Skyrim would look like were it built today in Unreal Engine 5.




More specifically, we get to see some incredible shots of the bitterly cold northerly city Winterhold. It looks, for want of a better phrase, pretty spectacular, which is not something many people are willing to say about TES5 these days.


What could have been


In this era of remakes, it&#x27;s fun to imagine what an aging game like Skyrim would look like in something such as Unreal. Torres&#x27; render gives us a taste of how things could have been in a different universe. Obviously, this is just a video render demonstrating Winterghold at a &quot;more realistic and lore-accurate scale.&quot; It&#x27;s not a remake currently in development, official or otherwise.


It also gives us an idea of just how far gaming visuals have come over the years. That&#x27;s not to say Skyrim is ugly (far from it), merely that many of us take it for granted just how advanced graphics become given enough time.


As for The Elder Scrolls itself, we&#x27;re currently on day seventy-squillion (citation needed) and no word on the sixth entry yet. There&#x27;s a good chance Skyrim&#x27;s popularity may drop off suddenly once TES6 comes out, but we&#x27;ll probably all be a lot older and wiser by then.

                              <span>With a The Legend of Zelda movie announced, fans have already been speculating on who will be filling which roles. Amidst the lively conversation, Patricia Summersett, who voices Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom, has stated that she would love to return to her role in the upcoming movie. 


In an interview with GamesRadar+, Summersett reveals just how attached she has grown to her role since she voiced in Breath of the Wild. Though she&#x27;s voiced the princess in three games already, including Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, she claims she &quot;could always take more of it.&quot; Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean that her return has been confirmed in the upcoming movie, as the cast list has yet to be revealed.

The Legend of Zelda movie


Earlier this year, there were rumors that a The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works courtesy of Illumination. The rumors were proven false, though they did correctly predict that Nintendo is working on adapting its highly successful franchise. 


The movie is being directed by Maze Runner&#x27;s Wes Ball, and it will be produced by Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad who is chairman of Arad Productions Inc. Somewhat surprisingly, the film is receiving financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment, though more than 50% will be financed by Nintendo. 


With no DLC planned for Tears of the Kingdom, the announced movie is something for fans to look forward to if they&#x27;re searching for their next big dose of Zelda. No release date has been given yet.

                              <span>There’s plenty to appreciate in Alan Wake 2 including the clever use of music and lyrics. One catchy song in particular has been popular enough to inspire a fan-made music video for it. Major spoilers are ahead if you haven&#x27;t played Initiation 4: We Sing.  


In Initiation 4, Alan finds himself in a weird musical featuring Sam Lake, Mr Door, and the Old Gods of Asgard. The chapter mixes live action with animation, and it provides lyrics so that you can sing along while catching up on the plot thus far. An unofficial video has been made by blending different scenes from throughout the game. It’s done so brilliantly that you’d swear it was an official music video from Remedy.

Music in Alan Wake 2


The song, called &#x27;Herald of Darkness&#x27;, is performed by the Finnish band Poets of the Fall who appear as the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard in the Alan Wake franchise. They play a pivotal role in Alan Wake 2 by helping Saga perform a summoning ritual near Cauldron Lake. The band&#x27;s songs also contain lyrics that are relevant to the game. 




Alan Wake isn’t the only game where Remedy has gone crazy with music. In Control, the soundtrack helps to set the atmosphere, and the Ashtray Maze in particular offers an unforgettable blend of music and game to keep your adrenaline pumping.




&#x27;Herald of Darkness&#x27; is hitting major streaming sites, including Spotify and Apple Music, on November 15. On December 8, you’ll be able to pick up the Old Gods of Asgard Rebirth - Greatest Hits album. It contains songs from the band found in the Alan Wake series and Control.


We may still get to hear more from the band, as Remedy has DLC planned for Alan Wake 2. The first offering, Night Springs, is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.

                              <span>One of the best action-RPGs in a generation is finally getting a mobile version, but it’s a mixed blessing. The good news is that Hades is coming to iPhones in 2024 and will be free for Netflix subscribers. The bad news is that it will be exclusive to both, with no way to buy the game outright or play it on Android…

Welp, Nintendo and Sony are already in development on a live-action Legend of Zelda movie and our brains are buzzin’. The announcement was, unsurprisingly, light on the details Zelda-heads are most interested in learning about, which has only made skepticism and speculation more rampant. Who is going to play Link? Will he talk? Why the heck is this movie going to be in live-action?

                              <span>And we thought our love lives were a disaster.
If you play enough video games, you can see when developers are playing it safe, but that isn’t the case for Outerloop’s Thirsty Suitors. If anything, it is trying to do too much, its ambition reaching to heights that its budget simply can’t deliver, but we found ourselves not minding. So much love went into this game that even its flaws are endearing.
We all know that one friend who makes every relationship a bit messy. In the small town of Timber Hills, that person is Jala. She’s a first-rate skateboarder and heartbreaker, returning to her hometown after ruining yet another relationship. Waiting for her are her parents, her incredibly strong Auntie, and a host of scorned lovers looking to even the score. Jala isn’t returning home on great terms, but untangling the mess she made when she left is what makes the characters of Thirsty Suitors shine so brightly.

Pokémon HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver are widely considered to be one of the greatest entries in the long-running franchise, but did you know that the games&#x27; male protagonist was actually altered to look more like a ninja for the DS remakes?
That&#x27;s according to a magazine translation discovered as part of DidYouKnowGaming&#x27;s comprehensive dive into HeartGold and SoulSilver, with Art Director Takao Unno stating that, yes, he actually is a ninja. Who knew..? When asked about the design of the male protagonist - commonly known as &#x27;Ethan&#x27; - Unno stated &quot;We wanted to make him more Japanese - or rather, make him look more like a ninja.&quot;

The next 7-Star Tera Raid Battle event has been announced for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and, with &#x27;Eevee Day&#x27; rapidly approaching (apparently), there are no prizes for guessing the starring &#x27;mon this time around (thanks, @SerebiiNet).
Yes, Eevee will be taking the spotlight in the upcoming event, which kicks off this weekend from 17th-20th November. Paired with the Normal Tera Type and carrying the Mightiest Mark, this special first-gen Pokémon can only be caught once per save file.

                              <span>Like clockwork.
The latest physical UK charts are here and, as expected, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III has landed with a band, comfortably taking the number one position despite selling roughly 25% less than the previous entry in the franchise (thanks, Chris Dring).
This means that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is no longer holding onto the gold trophy this week and instead settling for bronze, falling below Call of Duty and EA Sports FC 24. It&#x27;s not all doom and gloom though - far from it - as Nintendo is still well-represented in the top ten with Mario Wonder, Nintendo Switch Sports, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and the Switch version of Minecraft.

The latest Sonic platformer Sonic Superstars made its debut on the Switch and multiple other platforms last month. Digital Foundry has now uploaded a tech review, seeing how the Nintendo version of the game compares to the rest.
All versions except the Nintendo Switch &quot;largely share the same visual qualities&quot;. In handheld mode, the Switch delivers a full 720p native output but some stages run at a 720p resolution. In docked, the resolution hits 720p, with reduced texture resolution and lower texture filtering.

Citing National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild as examples, the paper notesthey&#x27;re owned by Disney. Vietnam&#x27;s Ministry of Information and Communications is said to be &quot;concerned&quot; that the withdrawal will allow piracy to run rampant in Vietnam. Multiple high-level trade reports in the U.S. note that piracy has been rampant for years.

                              <span>Studio Ghibli&#x27;s Spirited Away is a film about a spoilt young girl who is obliged to work at a bathhouse for supernatural creatures, after her parents are turned into pigs by a wicked witch. Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there&#x27;s no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.


I have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it&#x27;s &quot;just for kids&quot;. I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won&#x27;t spoil), so I&#x27;ll have to settle for trying the demo.

                              <span>You might have heard of the &quot;horseshoe theory&quot; in political science, which holds that far-left and far-right groups are actually closer to one another in terms of values and objectives than the political centre, coming together like the prongs of a horseshoe. I would like to propose an analogous theory for horror games and cute games whereby past a certain point of cuteness, the videogame in question teeters over dramatically into dread and nausea. We could call it the &quot;horseshuwu effect&quot;.


As evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield&#x27;s items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime. Do you like pink? No you don&#x27;t. Not this much.

                              <span>The best early Black Friday SSD deals combine nippy solid state storage, freshly slashed prices, and an impeccable sense of timing. Not only are the increasing girth of game installs making capacity more valuable than ever, but some new games are so reliant on fast loading that they can’t even run reliably on creaking old mechanical hard drives. Looking at you, Starfield and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Little scamps.

                              <span>I do not greatly enjoy the playing of Diablo 4, but I do rather enjoy its hellish setting, which I would characterise as a Warhammer table-top diorama dunked in a bucket of frozen offal. As such, I&#x27;m tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series &quot;a wonderful platform&quot; for different types of game, now that they&#x27;ve made the leap to an open world format. 


For the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as &quot;never before seen in the Diablo universe&quot;. But from the sounds of things, there&#x27;s scope for the &quot;franchise in general&quot; to evolve too.

                              <span>SportsTracker je open source aplikace pro sledování sportovních aktivit. Aplikace není vázána na konkrétní druh sportu, uživatel si může vytvořit kategorie pro všechny druhy sportů jako je cyklistika, běh, plavání nebo tenis. Uživatel získá přehled o aktivitách a může snadno vytvářet diagramy a statistiky pro konkrétní období a typy sportů. V kalendáři může sledovat svou tělesnou hmotnost nebo si vytvářet poznámky, např. tréninkový plán nebo nadcházející sportovní akce. Včera byla vydána verze 8.0.0. Hlavní novinkou je ukládání aplikačních dat do SQLite místo do několika XML souborů.</span>

                              <span>Now that the new DLC for Risk of Rain 2 has been officially revealed under the title Seekers of the Storm, Gearbox has begun its pre-release promotional campaign for it. Its first major checkpoint? A short discussion of Seekers of the Storm&#x27;s main villain, the ominous-sounding False Son.


More specifically, Gearbox&#x27;s first official Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm developer diary is about the DLC&#x27;s all-new final boss and the lore behind its existence. Though lore hasn&#x27;t historically been a huge draw in Risk of Rain or its highly acclaimed sequel, Risk of Rain 2, it&#x27;s worth highlighting that the franchise has a significant narrative backlog going in the background of all the killing. And now, the False Son represents the consequences of what the Survivors have been doing on the planet …</span>

                              <span>Have you ever been unable to decide between playing Genshin Impact and Pokémon? Or maybe you hate killing things in Genshin and want minions to do your dirty work instead? Well, now that Furina is here, I’ve been able to live my dreams of becoming a Pokémon trainer in Genshin Impact.


So, how do you play Pokémon in Genshin? Certain characters, like Fischl, can summon creatures to fight for them. Fischl can summon a crow familiar named Oz, who stays on-field and deals damage. There are others, too, like Kokomi, who summons a jellyfish, and Xiangling, who summons a small bear named Guoba. Combine multiple summons like this, and you end up with a field full of Pokémon ready to do your bidding.


Taking this concept, I tried to fully clear the current Spiral Abyss with Pokémon teams. Here’s h…</span>

Released to promote the Limited Edition of Persona 3 Reload, Atlus previews some of its two-disc soundtrack. The video showcases returning classics like Mass Destruction, When the Moon&#x27;s Reaching Out Stars, and Living with Determination. 




Meanwhile, samples for new songs exclusive to Persona 3 Reload are also heard, including It&#x27;s Going Down Now and Color Your Night. Both sound phenomenal and fit right into the themes of the game.

                              <span>Zagreus has found his new home: Netflix. Revealed during Netflix Geeked Week, Supergiant Games&#x27; Hades is coming to Netflix&#x27;s gaming service in 2024.




The 2020 roguelike is joining the ranks of Immortality, Spiritfarer, and Oxenfree as one of the available games in the service. Netflix Gaming is free for all Netflix subscribers, so owners of the streaming giant can play at no extra cost. The announcement also came with the news that Braid, Death&#x27;s Door, and Katana Zero would be added in 2024.


It&#x27;s in the Blood


Hades follows the son of the titular ruler of the underworld, Zagreus, as he tries to escape the Underworld. With the help of the gods of Olympus, you die, die, and die again as you battle through ever-changing maps. Upon its release on Switch and PC, the game was lauded for its character design and addicting roguelike gameplay.


Our own Jordan Devore rated the game a 9/10, citing Supergiant Games&#x27; strong storytelling and stellar RPG combat. Hades was nominated for multiple Game of the Year awards and even won Destructoid&#x27;s own Overall Best Game of 2020. 


I played the heck out of Hades when it was on Game Pass. Seeing it made available for all Netflix subscribers is a joy. Now, more people can play this stellar game whenever and wherever they want. It&#x27;s a trip to Hell I am down to go to.


The timing for Hades to come to Netflix is pretty coincidental, as Supergiant Games is expanding the universe next year with Hades II. The game, which made its way onto my RPGs to look out for, follows Zagreus&#x27; sister, Melinoë. Instead of her father, she&#x27;ll face the Titan of Time alongside new faces. The game is set to go Early Access in Q2 of 2024 for PC. While it&#x27;s set to release on consoles, no specifics were given.

                              <span>The adventures of Lara Croft are looking quite promising. As part of Netflix Geeked Week, Legendary Entertainment released a behind-the-scenes look at the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft series.


Powerhouse Animation Studios, known for its Castlevania series, is taking on the daring archaeologist with the help of Legendary Entertainment. Based on Crystal Dynamics&#x27; reboots/prequels, Netflix&#x27;s Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft sets up the Lara seen in the 1996 original. The video, narrated by Character Design Supervisor Joy Lua, showcases the globe-trotting journeys we&#x27;ll see her take, as well as some callbacks to different games.




Tomb Raider steps out of the shadows for Netflix


The video starts with some drawings and rough storyboard scenes, previewing some of the show&#x27;s worldwide action. We see Lara snowboarding off a parachute and traversing buildings in Paris like an action hero. As Lara in the reboot trilogy usually stayed in one country, it&#x27;s cool to see her out and about. 


Concepts for the places she&#x27;ll go (yes, including tombs) are shown toward the end. She&#x27;ll also sport some new gear, donning a dress in one shot and snow gear in another. Of course, she&#x27;ll have her bow, pickaxe, and pistols alongside her. The team aims to provide many Easter eggs for longtime fans and bridge the gap between old and new. 


While the animated Netflix series picks up after Shadow of the Tomb Raider, reboot era Lara voice actress Camilla Luddington of Grey&#x27;s Anatomy is not reprising her role, with Marvel the MCU&#x27;s Agent Carter, Haley Atwell, picking up the dual pistols. Jonah, played by Earl Baylon, is back and given a small look via concept art. As a fan of Castlevania and Powerhouse, as well as the reboots, it seems like Lara is in good hands.


Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is slated to release sometime in 2024.

                              <span>As a kid, I sometimes played odd games I found on the internet or watched playthroughs of them. Most of these were RPG Maker horror games because something about mixing cute art styles with terrifying imagery and plots resonated with a young me. 


The Coffin of Andy and Leyley is probably the first title to take me back to this oddly specific point in my life. Since playing the first two episodes, I can&#x27;t get it out of my head. 


The game follows siblings Andrew and Ashley Graves as they hatch a plan to escape the apartment they&#x27;re trapped in. Along the way, they develop a taste for human flesh, and it&#x27;s quickly clear that both are monsters.


It&#x27;s a well-written exploration of a toxic sibling dynamic and a revolting experience. I hesitate to call it trashy because it almost always balan…</span>

The launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was such a momentous occasion for me, so much so that the 12th May 2023 will forever be burned into the back of my mind. Over the summer, I kept playing it without putting it down, yet, as the weeks ticked by and the likes of Sea of Stars, Super Mario Bros. Wonder and a handful of Pikmin games were dropped at my feet like new toys in front of a puppy, I eventually put Link&#x27;s latest down and turned my attention to other things in the big, wide world (namely, more video games).

                              <span>I enjoy games where enemies are a resource as much as a hazard. It&#x27;s not enough that you can farm them for XP by killing them while they respawn, though. I also want to make the monsters appear myself.

So it is in Mob Factory, a blend of tower defense and factory management in which you quickly set up defenses against waves of worms, spiders, skeletons and so forth - and then set up spawners to create more waves, so you can turn their fallen remains into conveyor belts, walls, and eventually new islands to expand your monster-chewing factories upon. It just came out on Steam.

                              <span>Dungeon Keeper is a stone cold, never-bettered classic of the management genre, no matter how many other games try to mimic its devilish setting and moreish progression. The only issue is that the 1997 original is a little ugly and constrained by modern standards.

Enter KeeperFx, a long-running open source project to make the original Dungeon Keeper run at higher resolutions, with widescreen support, improved AI, online multiplayer, modern controls and user-made levels. After fifteen years of on-off development, it just hit 1.0.

I picked up Valve&#x27;s handheld with the aim of using it to play anything and everything, but instead I&#x27;ve used it almost exclusively to play topdown racer Circuit Superstars and Amiga-era throwback racer Horizon Chase Turbo.

Enter Super Woden GP 2, which just released yesterday. It&#x27;s a blend of Circuit Superstars with the simple car tweaking and progression of early Gran Turismo and it&#x27;s already heating up my Deck.

I didn&#x27;t mention this last week because Bonfire Night gives us an extra buffer between Halloween and Christmas, but it undeniably is time. Not time to start hanging your lights, perhaps, but at least time to start fortifying your mind to survive another Boxing Day rehash of a 30-year-old argument about your nan&#x27;s cutlery. Though I&#x27;m weeks deep in Christmas movies, so, you know, it&#x27;s certainly Mariah tiiiiiime for me. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking.

                              <span>Risk of Rain Returns has no shortage of awesome characters that players will want to chase after and unlock as soon as possible, with 15 of them available in total. Now Reddit user m0lmy has posted their experience with unlocking the strange Robomando, a secret 16th playable character. 


&quot;To my knowledge,&quot; says m0lmy in their Reddit comment, &quot;I am the first person to unlock this character intentionally.&quot; They, of course, posted a whole set of impressively complicated instructions for others to follow in their footsteps. Now that they are known and readily available, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard for players to follow m0lmy&#x27;s guide to unlocking the Robomando for themselves, but be warned: they&#x27;re about as random as random gets.




Risk of Rain Returns&#x27; Robomando is the secret 16th character

                              <span>Now that the kinda-sorta mid-generation refresh of the Steam Deck is officially announced, fans and tech YouTubers have begun poring over its specifications. However, one feature of the Steam Deck OLED that&#x27;s raised some eyebrows is its matte screen finish. 


Though Valve&#x27;s effectively refreshing its entire lineup of Steam Deck handhelds on November 16, some features of the original lineup are being carried over to newer models. One of them, specifically, is the anti-glare screen coating that&#x27;s present on the 1TB Steam Deck model. In most respects, the Steam Deck OLED is a substantial upgrade to the original, but tech reviewer Dave2D has raised concerns that the etched glass isn&#x27;t doing any favors to the new OLED display.




Is Steam Deck OLED&#x27;s matte screen coating an improvement?

A lawsuit filed Thursday in the United States claims to target a former &#x27;Top 10&#x27; Beast TV reseller who allegedly still sells Beast TV-branded subscriptions. When Beast was shut down almost three years ago, an announcement on the defendant&#x27;s alleged site, posted under a name that matches his, claimed the service was still alive.

That’s why Modern Warfare III, the latest entry in the long-running shooter franchise, is introducing a handful of new anti-cheat measures—including a hilarious one for Warzone that’ll flatten cheaters into the ground.

Smash T.V. was originally released in arcades in 1990. It was designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis, the guy behind 1981’s Defender. More importantly, he created 1982’s Robotron: 2084, which is the godfather of twin-stick shooters. Smash T.V. was built as a spiritual successor to that game, so it has all the features you’d expect, which is to say, it is also a twin-stick shooter.


Super Smash T.V. is the title used by the SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System, and Game Gear versions. What makes it “Super?” Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s just a straight port of the arcade title.

                              <span>Great Pretender, the exciting heist anime that was made available via Netflix in the Summer of 2020, could be teasing another season to be announced very soon. In a post made via Twitter, the official Great Pretender account reveals a “new release” will be announced on November 18 at Anime NYC.


In the post, an 18-second video serves as a highlight reel of the first season’s exploits, with the tagline “the greatest con artists return to the party,” which seems like a strong gesture towards another season.




In any case, the announcement will take place at a special panel held from 12:45 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. ET in Panel Room 1. The panel is set to feature George Wada, the president of Production I.G. and Wit Studio; Hiro Kaburagi, the director of Great Pretender; and Hitoshi Ito, the anime’s producer. According to Anime NYC’s website, those in attendance will be “invited to be the first to watch the world premiere and win some specially prepared presents from the guests.”


As stated, Great Pretender was released globally via Netflix on August 20, 2020. It ran for 23 episodes across four story arcs, with each arc covering a unique heist for the primary characters to pull off. I don’t wanna spoil it for anyone reading, but if this announcement is indeed a second season, let’s just say it’ll be more than welcomed with the ending of the season finale taken into account.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s gaming push is looping in one of its larger animated properties. The Dragon Prince: Xadia is a new action-RPG in development, arriving next year on mobile through Netflix.


The project looks to be handled by Wonderstorm, per the official site, and definitely takes after the action-RPG genre. In the reveal trailer, we can see quite a few gameplay moments that feel reminiscent of Diablo, Hades, and the like.




Characters look to run around, bash enemies&#x27; heads in, and unleash magic upon the battlefield. Netflix&#x27;s teaser describes the game as a &quot;hack &amp; slash looter ARPG,&quot; and also notes you can team up with friends. Feels very Diablo-y to me.


For the roster, I see a few expected faces, including leads like Callum and Rayla. I&#x27;m admittedly a bit behind on the show, but it&#x27;s nice to see the breadth of choices here. The shield-toting Amaya is a very welcome inclusion, too.


Netflix and games


The online streaming giant Netflix has been steadily making headway in the realm of games. It has a mobile service which has featured access to some notable titles, like 2018 gem Spiritfarer.


The company&#x27;s also making its own big push into games, through internal measures and external acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox and Oxenfree maker Night School Studio. Joseph Staten, of Halo/343 fame, was even brought on as Netflix Games&#x27; creative director.


It does seem like Netflix continues to be interested in games, both on their own and as properties for streaming shows. Whether these efforts pan out will be interesting to see, but it&#x27;s at least a good sign that Netflix&#x27;s game service has eschewed the microtransactions that typically plague mobile offerings. Because of that, this Dragon Prince ARPG on-the-go could be one to watch.

                              <span>The Xbox console versions of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 are on their way. And it looks like the optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version of BG3 may have some benefits for other platforms, too.


Larian Studios head Swen Vincke shared a look at some graphs for the upcoming port of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Notably, the graphs highlight how the optimizations being made are addressing an overall Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 speedbump: memory.


&quot;Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back I think this will benefit all platforms too,&quot; Vincke writes. &quot;Still some work left but very close now.&quot;




A new horizon for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3


The Xbox Series versions of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 are still coming along but planned for this year. While the massive RPG hit PC and PS5 earlier this year, the Xbox version was held off for some time, citing concerns about the Series S, a compromise was finally reached: allowing the Series S version to launch without split-screen co-op.


While the issues initially surrounded parity, seeing as the Series S is a step behind both the Series X and PlayStation 5, it looks like optimizing that port might be beneficial for all. The improvements in VRAM and RAM shown above definitely seem enticing, and if this makes my PC run BG3 better, then I&#x27;m all for it.


Plus, it means many more people will be able to play Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Despite a frankly crowded year for big releases, Larian&#x27;s RPG has been a huge hit for players, including myself. Getting Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 on Xbox Series S consoles, and optimizing it more in the process, seems like a real win-win.

                              <span>As 2023 comes to a close, the games industry once again prepares for another ceremony recognizing the year&#x27;s line-up of adventures that made us laugh, cry, and everything in between. While we all have our personal lists, The Game Awards (TGA) packages that into something a little more formal.


We&#x27;ve crafted our way through Hyrule, rolled in the Forgotten Realms, explored the Settled Systems, and swung through New York. As a massive celebration of video games, TGA acts as a sign-off and spotlight for things to come. With its formal list of nominees planned for a November 13 reveal, I figured I&#x27;d highlight a few of 2023&#x27;s dark horse candidates. Commit the box art to memory &#x27;cause I&#x27;m hoping for some snubs, surprises, and success stories out of these.

                              <span>Level-5 has quite the lineup of games in store, but it&#x27;s taking some extra time for at least one of them. The studio has confirmed that Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is being pushed into 2024.


The team says it&#x27;s pushing the Switch game back to ensure Fantasy Life i is released &quot;in better quality to everyone.&quot; No firm release date for next year&#x27;s been set, but we&#x27;ll be hearing about it soon. Level-5 is holding another Vision 2023 event later this month on November 29, where it plans to announce the new release date for Fantasy Life i.




What&#x27;s ahead for Level-5


Considering a number of Level-5&#x27;s other projects are all still labeled 2023—and we&#x27;re running out of 2023 with each day that passes—I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some other windows shift. If anything&#x27;s left to launch this year, there&#x27;s not a lot of time left.


That said, this reinvigorated Level-5 is exciting to see come together. While the studio&#x27;s been largely working on properties like Ni no Kuni and Yo-Kai Watch for the last few years, they&#x27;ve now got a hefty lineup of both familiar and fresh games. One in particular, Decapolice, has really caught my eye, and reportedly looked good at Tokyo Game Show 2023.


My hope is that Level-5 gets the time to comfortably make what they want to. This studio produces some wild, wonderful worlds that are a blast to explore, and both Fantasy Life i and its other games look really intriguing. We&#x27;ll hopefully learn more about Level-5&#x27;s docket moving forward at the end of the month.

                              <span>I’ve heard it being said many times and many ways, but this year has been an excellent one for games and an abysmal one for the folks who create them. On that note, Samurai Punk—the studio behind several indie games including Killbug and Screencheat—has announced its closure in a post via Twitter.




In the post, the team celebrates an impressive decade-long run as a studio, and notes that “it’s been an amazing run and we’d like to thank our team past and present; the 9 incredible games we’ve made wouldn’t have been possible without them.” 


In speaking of the team, Samurai Punk has created a Google doc with the information for those affected by this closure. “These incredible folks will now be looking for new roles, so if you have roles available or know of any openings, please contact us or the individuals directly.”


Samurai Punk was established in 2014, and is responsible for Screencheat, as well as The American Dream, Feather, Roombo: First Blood, and Killbug, among others. It is by no means the only studio that has suffered a closure in 2023 — some examples include Dillon’s Rolling Western developer Vanpool, Boomerang X developer Dang!, and the Embracer Group-owned Volition Games, who made Saints Row.


It genuinely hurts me to hear news like this, especially when games like Screencheat somehow manage to fly under my radar all this time. I am hoping with all my heart that these talented creators are able to land on their feet and continue creating for years to come.

                              <span>Recently, a group of modders released their own Community Patch for Starfield, representing a collaboration working to improve the studio&#x27;s new IP. Creative fans have crafted mods left, right, and center since the game&#x27;s release, and that&#x27;s without official modding support from Bethesda. 


In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Timothy &quot;Halgari&quot; Baldridge, one of the founders of the Starfield Community Patch, spoke about the efforts being put in to fix issues with the space-faring RPG. Halgari broke down how Starfield&#x27;s hindered modding potential is a bit of a sore spot and how digging around reveals game code that prepared for those features, but they aren&#x27;t there yet. 


It looks like a plan, according to Halgari, that Bethesda &quot;would add modding some day&quot; to its new IP but hasn&#x27;t yet. H…</span>

                              <span>Get your bribe money ready. Weappy Studios, the developer behind This is the Police, has unveiled their latest game, Hollywood Animal. It’s set to release on PC sometime in 2024.


Hollywood Animal is a narrative management sim where you try to run a movie studio with as few scruples as possible. Manage staff through gifts or blackmail, create movies to gain favors, but just keep things as profitable as possible. Craft art, build stars, or simply find their dark spots so you can stick a hook in and make them dance. All this is covered in the absolutely fantastic announcement trailer.




I don’t remember the last time I saw a game trailer that superb.


Hollywood Animal is being billed as a narrative-first game, but includes all the standard management hooks. By the looks of all the systems show off, it’s really quite complex. It takes you through the ages as you try to keep your studio afloat while not bringing too much attention to your shady dealings. Select the director, the writers, and the actors, and then try to keep them all happy (or at least complacent). Navigate the changing political landscape of the ages.


I am so on board with this. I’ve wanted a good movie studio simulator for a while, or at least a re-release of 2005’s The Movies. Crime is also a passion of mine, so it&#x27;s a really good mix.


Hollywood Animals is currently announced for PC and is expected to land sometime in 2024.

                              <span>This year has seen a slew of studios and gaming companies face significant layoffs, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like things are set to slow down soon. It appears Unity may be the next to suffer layoffs as it attempts to become a &quot;leaner, more agile, and faster growing company.&quot;


In a shareholder letter, Unity CEO James Whitehurst claims that the company has a big opportunity to grow in the future, though that may be difficult at present because the team is trying to do too much at once. As Whitehurst explains, &quot;we are not achieving the synergies that exist across our portfolio, and we are not executing to our full potential.&quot; 


Third-quarter financial results are described as &quot;mixed.&quot; The strategy to make the company leaner will include increasing focus on its main projects such as the Unity Editor. Though nothing is set in stone yet, the plan will likely involve discontinuing certain products, reducing the business&#x27;s office footprint, and reducing the size of the workforce. 


The letter also addressed the controversy surrounding the announcement of runtime fees. Whitehurst acknowledges that &quot;the execution created friction with our customers and near-term headwinds.&quot; Despite this, there&#x27;s no indication of any intentions to back down. The event is described as &quot;now mostly behind us,&quot; though it is expected that because of the controversy, the new business model will be minimally beneficial in 2024 until customers adopt Unity&#x27;s new releases.


No date is given regarding when these interventions will be implemented but further guidance will come with the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

                              <span>Despite its legacy, Xbox 360 puzzle-platformer Braid hasn&#x27;t been around much. However, that&#x27;s all about to change as the game&#x27;s creator Jonathan Blow has recently announced an Anniversary Edition coming in 2024.


Releasing April 30, this new version of Braid comes with improved visuals and animations, areas that have been &quot;re-envisioned to make them more unique,&quot; and more than 15 hours of commentary. If you&#x27;re interested in the world game development, that last one may be of interest to you.




This special Anniversary Edition – which is launching to celebrate 15 years of Braid – is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, and even Netflix. It&#x27;ll also be available on PS4 and Xbox One, with Linux and Mac ports coming later on.


Considered a &quot;masterpiece&quot;


Originally released on Xbox 360 in 2008, Braid has been described as one of the greatest independent games of its generation. It won several awards and was the second-largest-selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It has a Metacritic score of 93.


Its developer Blow is no stranger to the video game world. Some of his earlier work includes being a programmer on Oddworld: Munchy&#x27;s Oddysee and Deus Ex: Invisible War. He released the puzzle title The Witness in 2016.


He&#x27;s also gained something of a reputation over the years, often being held aloft as an outspoken critic of the gaming industry. He was described in a 2016 New Yorker article as a &quot;prickly genius,&quot; while an interview with Kotaku in 2011 said Blow&#x27;s opinions are not aimed at individuals, but at &quot;trends.&quot; He&#x27;s also no stranger to making public controversial statements over the years, further complicating his legacy.


In any case, Braid is often signposted as an indie release that helped shape an industry of indie releases. This was before Minecraft did it. If you still haven&#x27;t played the game (guilty), April&#x27;s Anniversary Edition is definitely one to look out for.

                              <span>[Update: The full song has been released! You can find it on YouTube as part of this Game Changer album playlist, as well as via the embedded video below. The album can be found on iTunes and BandCamp.]




The Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song &quot;I Wanna Take You for a Ride.&quot; It&#x27;s been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. 




Marvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride


Despite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it&#x27;s one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.


The 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. 


Last year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a &quot;Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella&quot; Grammy for its cover of &quot;Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge&quot; from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.


Perhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they&#x27;ll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, &quot;Game Changer,&quot; accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10.

                              <span>Fallout 76 was released on November 14, 2018 in a wretched state, and I absolutely cannot believe it&#x27;s been five years since then. While most publishers would have buried it and moved on, the creative team got to work and the funding arrived to salvage the game. To celebrate, in-game events are on the way.


Fallout 76 5-year anniversary event details


We&#x27;re not getting a massive quality of life overhaul or DLC per se, but there will be a streaming event on Twitch on Tuesday November 14 at 3PM ET, as well as a birthday event from now through November 21 at 12PM ET.


Here is the full rundown of the stream from Bethesda:



&quot;Organized by our friends at Fallout for Hope, we have over 40 floats, live music, Atom giveaways and more! Did we also mention that Adrienne Barbeau, who you know as the voice of the Overseer, will be doing a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. introduction speech? And who better to narrate the parade than Wes Johnson himself? Wes Johnson who you know as the voice of… well… all our favorite robots! Protectrons, Fasnacht Paraders, Nuka-World&#x27;s Dr. Del Walsh, and many more! (No, seriously, look him up we love his voice!)&quot;




Fallout 76 is in good company, alongside No Man&#x27;s Sky and Final Fantasy XIV (1.0)


While there was no excuse for the state it was launched in, Fallout 76 gets high marks on its report card in the BUG (bring-up-grades) section. The team actually committed to making the game better, and while it took nearly two years to add NPCs (the turning point for 76), they came all the same. It sounds rediculous, adding in content that seems standard for open world games, but such was the early state of Fallout 76.

I think I know why. Let me find the tweet. Here it is. Lead engine designer at Nightdive, Samuel Villarreal tweeted, “Nothing&#x27;s better than failing PS4 certification one week before a game is shipped because it crashes when loading a specific level, only on a PS4 Pro, only on 4k resolution, and only when a debugger is not attached.” He then sarcastically added, “Yup, I sure do enjoy that.”




He later added that the issue has now been fixed, but the turnaround time on certification is slow.


There&#x27;s no official confirmation that certification problems were the cause of the delay i…</span>

                              <span>Destiny 2 is currently in a rough spot. Player morale is at an all-time low, tanking after a round of Bungie layoffs and news of a reported delay for the upcoming The Final Shape expansion. And while Bungie is using the delay to double down on ensuring the new expansion is a smash hit, serious concerns about Destiny&#x27;s longevity are cropping up. Even if The Final Shape proves to be everything Bungie promises, inescapable factors persist against the game.


But the situation didn&#x27;t get like this overnight. Bungie&#x27;s decisions reportedly came after noting the title&#x27;s yearly revenue would fall 45% below expectations. That sharp decline is symptomatic of issues that have been building for years. And with player sentiment where it is, alongside a projected content drought and a perceived &quot;endpoin…</span>

                              <span>With the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer announcement being made recently, all eyes are once again on Rockstar&#x27;s behemoth franchise. Not that eyes were ever truly off it. GTA 5 is still doing phenomenally well, as outlined in Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s recent figures.


According to conference call notes uploaded a couple of days ago, Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold approximately 190 million units since it launched in 2013. Compare this to November 2022&#x27;s prepared remarks – when it had sold 170 million – and it&#x27;s obvious the game is still selling in droves.


At this rate, it could well fly past the 200 million mark, maintaining its stance as the second highest-selling game after Minecraft (which recently hit 300 million).


Better be worth the wait


GTA 6 is still pretty elusive. Aside from the leak in 2022, we really don&#x27;t know much about the hugely anticipated follow-up. Rockstar has promised the first official trailer in December, so at least we have that to look forward to.


It&#x27;s a tall order to be the next big thing after Grand Theft Auto 5, but after years of speculations, leaks, and the collective will of gamers everywhere, the world is finally ready for the next installment.


It&#x27;s tempting to say that once the sixth game comes out, sales of GTA 5 may slow down significantly. However, Rockstar&#x27;s not above rehashing some of its older (and more lucrative) titles, so who knows what the studio has planned for the game. There&#x27;s still some milking to be done for that proverbial cash cow.

                              <span>It&#x27;s pretty well known that Bethesda nearly had a voiced protagonist in Starfield. The developer decided against it in the end. However, did you know that one of those actors could well have been the voice behind Adam Jensen?


In a recent post on Twitter/X, Elias Toufexis, who takes on the role of the main character in the two most recent Deus Ex games, said he was originally going to voice the Starfield hero.




He also said that Cissy Jones – another prolific video game voice artist – was originally planned to play the protagonist, presumably the female version. However, while Bethesda did scrap the idea in the end, we did still get to hear both actors, with Toufexis playing Sam Coe and Jones playing Andreja.


Would it have been better?


With the exception of Fallout 4, Bethesda games typically have a silent main character. Many argue this helps with immersion. It could also be a time, money, and labor-saving decision at the hands of the studio.


In any case, Starfield having a mute protagonist is par for the course for Todd Howard and his team. We could be looking at a different experience if we had Toufexis&#x27; gravelly dialogue guiding us through the cosmos.


Despite major hype for the game, Starfield doesn&#x27;t feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. It&#x27;s still a good sci-fi game – and the continuous updates will only improve things – but it might be a stretch to think of it as a potential Bethesda classic in years to come.

                              <span>What is a birthday but a celebration that, despite all your struggles, you survived? It has been almost a year since the release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, meaning it&#x27;s been now a full year of apologies, paused expansions, and transformative patches. And yet it lives.

The co-op shooter now seems on firmer ground, and to celebrate it&#x27;s getting a two-part update called The Traitor Curse. Part one will add a new zone and mission, among other updates.

Naturally it became an internet sensation all the way back in 2007, bolstered further by the release of the source code in 2011 and a tidal wave of fangames that followed.

Now there&#x27;s an easier way to make those fangames. I Wanna Maker is a freeware precision platformer with level editor and easy level sharing, and it just hit version 1.0.

                              <span>Roadwarden&#x27;s creator, the Polish writer and designer Aureus of Moral Anxiety Studio, is an enthusiastic and inventive player of table-top games. Many of his ideas for 2022&#x27;s finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. &quot;They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, &#x27;is there a cart around here?&#x27; So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that&#x27;s completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. 


&quot;They had no shame!&quot; Aureus goes on. &quot;Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they&#x27;re just going to sell it all.&quot;  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. &quot;So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.&quot;

That&#x27;s exciting enough to me in concept, but there&#x27;s a trailer below that finally shows what each of those halves look like. It includes: finely animated dialogue options, and frenetic races in which you can swing the back-end of your car to smash rival racers off the road.

It comes courtesy of Aerothorn, who asks: What is your favorite co-op gaming memory? (along with the additional clarification that these memories don&#x27;t need to be confined to designed-for-co-op games, but could also stem from playing a single-player game with a friend. &quot;I used to play Descent with me piloting and my friend gunning!&quot; they said).

                              <span>Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two&#x27;s CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they&#x27;re pretty cheap for what you get in return.
Zelnick cautioned one investor against &quot;generalising&quot; about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn&#x27;t mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they&#x27;re overdelivering.

                              <span>The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they&#x27;re not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don&#x27;t need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it&#x27;s such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.
Here&#x27;s a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I&#x27;m going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.

                              <span>As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it&#x27;s been interesting to see which modern games have been &quot;demade&quot; in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. 
Crow Country is the latest game I&#x27;ve seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it&#x27;s currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it&#x27;s got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?

                              <span>World of Warcraft&#x27;s expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There&#x27;s the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there&#x27;s the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. 


Naturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It&#x27;s the first time Blizzard&#x27;s long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they&#x27;ve been doled out by lottery. Blizzard&#x27;s game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within&#x27;s Epic edition won&#x27;t give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.

An expert on yearning for them, anyway.

Enter Risk Of Rain Returns, a full remaster of the 2D original with higher resolution artwork, new survivors, and slicker multiplayer. It&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later. 
Starting today and every Friday at 2 p.m. Central on Twitch,  join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they&#x27;ll stream two hours of the game each week until they beat it. If you can&#x27;t watch us live, new episodes will be uploaded the next Saturday morning on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel.

                              <span>This past weekend was a big one for Blizzard, as its yearly BlizzCon event brought news across several properties, including World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. In the wake of the expansion announcement and seasonal reveals that rolled out about Diablo IV, we had the chance to speak with Diablo franchise manager Rod Fergusson and game director Joe Shely. We asked about the studio’s development processes post-launch, the specifics of gathering and responding to fan feedback and criticism, and the most critical priorities for Diablo IV in the months following launch.

Game Informer: With the acknowledgment that it’s very different individuals and teams involved, on a studio level I’m curious if there are things about the post-launch support for Diablo III that are now being put into us…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve seen Netflix&#x27;s Arcane League of Legends animated series, there&#x27;s a high probability you really like it – the show&#x27;s great, even for non-League of Legends fans. It tells the heartwrenching story of sisters Vi and Jinx and their struggle to come to terms with each other in the high-tech (and magical) utopian city of Piltover and its seedy underbelly known as Zaun. The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. 
More specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below:

With roughly a year to go before Season 2, if you haven&#x27;t yet watched Arcane, which features voice actors like Hailee Steinfeld, Yuri Lowenthal, Ella Purnell, and more, you&#x27;ve got plenty of time to do so – and it&#x27;s well worth your time!
In the meantime, check out the League of Legends Jinx champion skin that was added to Fortnite to celebrate Arcane, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Ruined King: A League of Legends story. Read about Convergence: A League of Legends Story after that.

Following a Bloomberg report yesterday claiming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which launched today, originally began as an expansion to last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II before becoming a full game (with a 16-month turnaround to boot), developer Sledgehammer Games released a statement its X account seemingly indirectly refuting the report.

                              <span>With recently picking up the Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 4 powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U and given the recent release of Fedora 39, I found it to be a nice time to provide a Lenovo ThinkPad retrospect of how the AMD Ryzen laptop Linux performance has evolved the past few generations. In today&#x27;s article is a look at how the AMD Ryzen 7 mobile series laptop performance has evolved going back to Zen 2 for various ThinkPad models while all testing was carried out on the brand new Fedora Workstation 39 Linux release.</span>

                              <span>Destined to gather dust?
As we approach 2024, we&#x27;re naturally getting increasingly keen to learn more about Nintendo&#x27;s next major piece of hardware, affectionately dubbed the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;, for now. After all, although the current line-up of upcoming Switch games is certainly nothing to sneer at, there&#x27;s no denying that Nintendo is leaning heavily on remakes and remasters, presumably while its core teams work on &#x27;next-gen&#x27; titles. If that doesn&#x27;t indicate a new console is on the horizon, we&#x27;re not sure what does.
At the moment, the majority of us are under the assumption that the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; will be a reasonably &#x27;safe&#x27; upgrade to the current console in general form and function; a hybrid device that retains the core concept of the Switch but beefs up the performance considerably while possibly adding a few new innovations here and there. It makes sense, right? Although many of us are eager to move on to the next big thing, Nintendo isn&#x27;t ready to ditch the Switch brand, and none of us want it to. It still works wonderfully after all these years, so why do anything drastically different?

Nightdive Studios has announced that Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion has been delayed slightly on Switch and is now scheduled to arrive on November 30th, 2023.
The team hasn&#x27;t provided a specific reason behind the delay, but given that it&#x27;s only a couple of weeks after the initial release date, we&#x27;re honestly not too concerned.

                              <span>They put a Shrek in it.
Given that he’s an internet icon these days and the star of countless memes, it’s a bit of a surprise that it’s taken this long – 12 full years, in fact – to find a way to get Shrek into another video game. The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.
DreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry). Sadly, while this DreamWorks-themed racer has a number of decent ideas, the execution is as sloppy as a Bergin eating a Troll.

Nintendo has published the official English translation of the financial report Q&amp;A for Q2 FY2024, and it wraps up with a particularly interesting comment on the company&#x27;s recently-changed approach to hardware and software development.
Asked about whether Nintendo has shifted to using software as a means of bringing about new styles of gameplay (rather than hardware), Director and Senior Managing Executive Officer Shinya Takahashi stated that the company has recently started to see the software and hardware development teams holding conversations as &quot;a single unit&quot; from the &quot;early stages of hardware development&quot;. Hmmm.

When Nintendo announced that it was developing a movie based on The Legend of Zelda, Shigeru Miyamoto wrenched control of Nintendo&#x27;s Twitter account away from the company&#x27;s social team to give a few short details on the project.
There, he stated that he had been &quot;working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san&quot;. We took &quot;many years&quot; to mean three or four, possibly five at a push, but it turns out we were way off. According to the newly translated Q&amp;A session from Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial release, Miyamoto and Arad have been discussing the movie for ten years. A decade, folks.

                              <span>Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:
In Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 
Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.
In Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.
And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.
The games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.

Hlavním důvodem je, že architektura sama už je dlouho na ústupu, její rozvoj v jádře se prakticky zastavil. V posledních letech tedy vývojáři jádra považují kód pro Itanium za brzdu dalšího vývoje.</span>

Under this system, user identities would not have been obtained by BREIN, but after a local ISP refused to cooperate and BREIN&#x27;s request to proceed was denied twice in court, BREIN had a decision to make.

                              <span>Samsung&#x27;s 980 Pro SSD may not be the company&#x27;s PCIe 4.0 NVMe flagship any more, but it&#x27;s still a fearsomely fast SSD in its own right that comes very close indeed to the 990 Pro in real-world performance tests. The 2TB model is currently discounted over at Amazon US, where you can find it for just $103 rather than its usual $128 - one of the best prices we&#x27;ve recorded for a 2TB drive of this speed and quality.

That&#x27;s a solid value for a spec that also includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD and 15.6-inch 1080p 144Hz IPS display. This particular model used to go for £1200, making it a nice £350 reduction.

                              <span>To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want &quot;more, more, more&quot; rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

                              <span>While the Steam Deck OLED is awash with upgrades over the original handheld PC, it’s not a full replacement, and Valve still reckon that anyone wanting a proper Steam Deck 2 will be waiting a while. 
I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won&#x27;t change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

                              <span>I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

                              <span>Valve love their surprise hardware announcements, and there’s just been a doozy in the Steam Deck OLED. It’s a &quot;definitive&quot; refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

                              <span>For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Erm.


Let&#x27;s start again. As you may know, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - is out from today, 9th November. Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don&#x27;t fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven&#x27;t been great.

                              <span>When Kiryu&#x27;s tale &quot;ended&quot; in Yakuza 6, it left me in absolute tatters. A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn&#x27;t ever see his family again. Since then, we&#x27;ve had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii&#x27;s shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it&#x27;s a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu&#x27;s been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu&#x27;s epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza&#x27;s best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn&#x27;t the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

Still, we can rest assured that it is finally &quot;content complete&quot;.

                              <span>“To be a good designer, you have to have very, very strong opinions,” says Slay The Spire design lead Anthony Giovannetti. “Show me a game designer who gives a thumbs-up to most things, and I suspect that’s probably someone who doesn’t have a very good game design sense. I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

                              <span>GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

                              <span>Valve has unveiled its first upgraded iteration of the Steam Deck. Dubbed simply the Steam Deck OLED, the new handheld features several technical and form factor improvements, and it goes on sale next week.
As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360&#x27;s Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces. The strong mechanics combined with its contemplative writing made Braid a critical hit, with many hailing it as a masterpiece.

                              <span>Sony announced it was acquiring Destiny 2 maker Bungie for $3.6 billion in January of 2022. A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation&#x27;s in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…</span>

It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games&#x27; latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year&#x27;s best-selling games.
For context, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. 
Woo! We&#x27;re incredibly honored to announce Marvel&#x27;s #SpiderMan2PS5 has sold over 5 MILLION COPIES!

                              <span>Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

Police say they seized luxury cars, silver bars, cryptocurrency and cash. Other crimes that make the prosecution much more intriguing are mentioned in much less detail.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Core i5 12600KF is one of the company&#x27;s best value gaming CPUs, and today it&#x27;s down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

                              <span>As regular readers of this column will know, I&#x27;m a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it&#x27;s down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That&#x27;s about as cheap as we&#x27;ve ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

                              <span>When first I played GTA Online back in the Xbox 360 days it felt like an afterthought, a chance to play some random good-for-nothing in GTA 5&#x27;s sizzling alt-Los Angeles, securely cloistered away from the events of the all-important singleplayer story. Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar&#x27;s GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt. The no-name crim has become the star attraction.

                              <span>Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one genre I&#x27;ve never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it&#x27;s the bullet hell shooter. I&#x27;ve long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It&#x27;s not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent&#x27;s attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It&#x27;s very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

                              <span>Last time, you narrowly decided that soulslike bloodstains are better than ghosts walking through walls. That sounds to me like the decisions of cowards who not only don&#x27;t want to be got by ghosts, they want to be warned about the presence of any danger. Maybe I&#x27;m being ungenerous; maybe what you truly enjoy is watching other people get extremely ghostgot. I cannot deny it is great to watch someone absolutely stack it. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between two automatic assists. What&#x27;s better: auto-level up, or auto-detect graphics settings?

The next game from developer Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build, is... very different, at least on the surface.


The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you&#x27;re a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you&#x27;re doing here, and why everybody&#x27;s so terrified of the sun. I haven&#x27;t deciphered the mystery yet.

This is Mass Effect 5, actual title possibly Mass Effect: Epsilon - &quot;epsilon&quot; being the Top Secret Codename of this hidden page on the Mass Effect website. What does it all mean? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a nice coat, though, isn&#x27;t it? I like those padded red lapels.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last month and quickly became Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. We loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 review here – but players and critics alike have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughs, in some cases, and progress impediment in other cases. Developer Insomniac Games released a patch last week that addressed a handful of issues and now, it has released a new update that fixes even more bugs and issues. 


Here&#x27;s the full Update Version 1.001005 release notes:

                              <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora introduces three brand-new clans to the Avatar universe: the Aranahe, Zeswa, and Kame’tire. Each tribe calls one of the Western Frontier’s three biomes – Kinglor Forest, Upper Plains, and Clouded Forest, respectively – home. Ingratiating yourself with each one by learning their ways is an important step in your journey to reclaim your Na’vi culture, as well as garnering enough support to push back against the exploitative mining of the villainous RDA.
For a heads-up on what to expect as you try to warm up to each clan, here’s a breakdown of the culture and personality.

The first clan you encounter resides in the Kinglor Forest. Like the Omatikaya clan from the first film, the Aranahe live in a Hometree and have a symbiotic relationship with Kinglor, …</span>

Yesterday, Embracer COO Egil Strunke announced that he had resigned from the position to launch a new game company, as reported by PC Gamer, amidst Embracer&#x27;s rough year.

                              <span>Nintendo isn&#x27;t quite ready to say goodbye to the Switch, its second best-selling console ever. According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It&#x27;s been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward.

                              <span>Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar&#x27;s parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar&#x27;s next game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

                              <span>Revenant Hill, the next game by the makers of Night in the Woods, has been canceled. The reason is that the game&#x27;s narrative designer and artist Scott Benson is battling a severe illness that has forced him to step away from the project.
Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below. 
So. Over the past 12 months or so I got very sick and it didn&#x27;t go away. Eventually I was diagnosed with severe heart failure, most likely from a virus. It will continue to greatly limit me for the foreseeable future and as such I&#x27;ve had to stop working in the manner I once did.

                              <span>Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023&#x27;s wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company&#x27;s Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


&quot;These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,&quot; the company told both IGN and Kotaku. &quot;We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.&quot; Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to &quot;to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.&quot;
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that&#x27;s in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

This open-world action game unfolds in a new section of James Cameron’s wildly successful Avatar universe, and this new chapter in the mythos graces Game Informer’s cover this month.

It&#x27;s currently available to wishlist on Steam, indicating a PC release, but there&#x27;s no word about consoles. However, the announcement comes with news that a Kickstarter for Always in Mind is coming soon.

                              <span>At Apple&#x27;s keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won&#x27;t be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you&#x27;ll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you&#x27;re a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you&#x27;re on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven&#x27;t been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.</span>

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn&#x27;t without its faults, it&#x27;s a more-than-worthy follow-up.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014&#x27;s Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a &quot;regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience.&quot; 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year&#x27;s end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says &quot;players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community.&quot; 
&quot;At Hexworks, we&#x27;re incredibly proud of the open relationship we&#x27;re fostering with our community,&quot; studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. &quot;We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre&#x27;s boundaries.&quot;

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment launched Alan Wake 2, its Alan Wake sequel 13 years in the making, last month to the delight of both critics and fans – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review here. Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it&#x27;s one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that&#x27;s everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes. After that, read this feature about the characters to remember before starting Alan Wake 2, and then check out what the best graphics modes are in the game.

                              <span>The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo&#x27;s best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company&#x27;s best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It&#x27;s possible the Switch reaches the DS&#x27; numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn&#x27;t end sales of the hardware. And consider…</span>

                              <span>Mechanical gaming keyboards used to be premium options available to very few, but now they often go on sale for extremely low prices - even from big names. Today HyperX joins that list of big-name bargains with their Alloy Origins full-size mechanical keyboard dropping to just $32 when bought from GameStop in the US, versus its original price of $109.99. That&#x27;s a great bargain for a keyboard with red (soft linear) mechanical switches, optional RGB lighting and a high-quality metal chassis.

They&#x27;re currently offering both a range of keyboard-and-mouse bundles and sales on individual products, so I thought I&#x27;d take a look at the sale and recommend a few items that I&#x27;ve personally tested and have recommended for Digital Foundry. Let&#x27;s go!

I therefore look at co-op survival game Enshrouded, with its voxel building, grapple hooks, wingsuits, and think: pah, what tomfoolery. This looks fun. Not at all my sort of thing. It might be yours, though. It&#x27;s now got a January 24th release date and a new trailer, below.

A brief, fifteen second trailer showed a little of that combat in action in The Chinese Room&#x27;s rebooted take on the RPG sequel. Find it below.

The word &quot;anacrusis&quot; refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve&#x27;s Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I&#x27;ll be honest, I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn&#x27;t even a pun in the title!

                              <span>Hello folks. I know we&#x27;ve barely broken out of spooky season, but over in the RPS Treehouse we&#x27;re rapidly preparing to warm up our vocal chords and bellow &quot;It&#x27;s CHRIIIIIIIISTMASSSSSS&quot; from the rooftops in the spirit of Slade&#x27;s seasonal epic. That&#x27;s right. Advent Calendar season is upon us, and we&#x27;ll be voting for our favourite games of the year very shortly. So I thought I&#x27;d use this month&#x27;s Letter From The Editor to give you a little behind the scenes glimpse of how we&#x27;ll be doing this in the coming weeks, and how we generally go about putting it all together every year.

Ah wait, jewel in the crown! - is new 64-player map The Reclamation of Montcrux, in which the rampaging Agathians attempt to overrun a fort held by the Tenosians, pitting petard against bombard, battering ram against ballista. 


Gosh, that&#x27;s a lot of medieval words. The translation is that one side has to run up the hill screaming while the other side lobs big balls of fire at them. Bash your way into the castle and you&#x27;ll be able to stop the aforesaid rain of fireballs, though you&#x27;ll still have to worry about getting dinged upside the headbone by dudes in plate. Onward, friends to the next paragraph! We have nothing to lose but our limbs!

                              <span>Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, &quot;We&#x27;re here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy.&quot; I can almost see Croteam&#x27;s writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot&#x27;s eyes. You&#x27;re not fooling me, Croteam. I&#x27;m here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can&#x27;t stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be &#x27;born&#x27; into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we&#x27;re living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

They&#x27;ve organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton&#x27;s offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

                              <span>PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform&#x27;s then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. &quot;Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu.&quot; 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class &quot;never seen before in the Diablo universe.&quot; 
And that&#x27;s all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV&#x27;s first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won&#x27;t be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

Lightning McQueen is also an extra special release. Beyond being a big collaboration between the vehicular soccer game and Disney and Pixar, it&#x27;s the first car in Rocket League to feature dynamic expressions. 
Like in the Cars Pixar franchise, Lightning McQueen will look around the pitch while you cruise the Arena, narrow his eyes as you focus his speed, and react with each score. &quot;With the Lightning McQueen Mega Bundle, you&#x27;ll be able to play as three different versions of the Route 66 icon,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;First up is the Rust-eze Decal.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he&#x27;s already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2&#x27;s Season 8 launch on December 5. &quot;Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power,&quot; Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it&#x27;s the hero we&#x27;re expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here&#x27;s a look at Hanaoka below: 
For more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Overwatch 2 review, and then check out our Diablo IV review.

As far as pitches go, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, the next game in what used to be called the Yakuza series, is hard to beat: Find out what happened to series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma between Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The former ended with Kiryu faking his death to keep his adopted family of orphans safe. The idea was his story was over – he was moving on to the next chapter of his life. Developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio pitched it as such. Until the latter, when he …</span>

Starting November 19, select retailers and Nintendo&#x27;s own store will begin offering a new Super Smash Bros. Ultimate bundle that includes a Switch OLED model, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate-themed Joy-Con, and the full Super Smash Bros. Ultimate game download.

                              <span>Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game&#x27;s development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity&#x27;s story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we&#x27;re currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


&quot;Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,&quot; Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. &quot;There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, &#x27;What is humanity? What is human nature?&#x27; We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It&#x27;s like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we&#x27;re trying to depict in Humanity.&quot;
Watch above or over on Game Informer&#x27;s YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. &quot;Violence Is Inevitable&quot; speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project&#x27;s origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.</span>

                              <span>Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite&#x27;s history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn&#x27;t list a specific reason but it&#x27;s pretty clear it&#x27;s because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer&#x27;s breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite&#x27;s Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

                              <span>An achievement added to Baldur’s Gate 3’s GOG release has teased the possible addition of a new permadeath mode for the D&amp;D RPG - meaning that if your whole party dies, your save will be permanently wiped. In a game where play time counts can end up in the hundreds of hours, that’s a fairly terrifying prospect.

As it turns out, with the old map and items came a whole lot of players, setting a new all-time concurrent player record for the multiplayer shooter that surpasses even its previous heights in the pop-culture zeitgeist.

                              <span>Much like Weyland-Yutani linking arms with Skynet, Microsoft have teamed up with Inworld to bring the latter&#x27;s &quot;generative AI&quot; tools to Xbox studios. This &quot;multi-year co-development partnership&quot; will &quot;build a powerful toolkit that harnesses artificial intelligence to enrich the narrative and character creation elements of game development&quot;, according to Inworld CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn. You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

                              <span>When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it&#x27;s Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek&#x27;s PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community&#x27;s ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

                              <span>While reviewing Cities Colon Skylines 2, I didn&#x27;t actually go in that hard on public transport (beyond providing it and making it free), despite the urge. Since then though, it&#x27;s become a game where I don&#x27;t so much build a single mega-city as a series of experiments.
Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

                              <span>Hello folks. A small bit of RPS Game Club news today. Since it&#x27;s starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won&#x27;t be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this first year&#x27;s outing of the RPS Game Club, and we&#x27;d love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you&#x27;re a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

                              <span>In 2021, Twitter user Thomas Violence, an Australian podcaster who was working in a bar at the time, recounted that a 19-year-old had asked for a refund on their drink because they realised they were too drunk already. One of the early replies was an &quot;ummm actually,&quot; pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded &quot;I&#x27;m one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that&#x27;s not America&quot;. I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach &quot;Zach Gage&quot; Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I&#x27;ve not subbed because I&#x27;m just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

                              <span>Mad dashes, daring escapes, last minute reversals: these are some of my favourite moments in multiplayer shooters. It’s exhilarating to scream towards the chopper in Left 4 Dead or a dropship in Titanfall. 

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I&#x27;ve played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

They&#x27;ve brought on original Portal voice actress Ellen McClain to narrate the footage, and the result is genuinely quite funny. As you&#x27;d expect, GlaDOS isn&#x27;t that impressed by Croteam&#x27;s work. I score this a 7/10 on the Hoot And/Or Holler scale.

                              <span>Bloober Team and Konami&#x27;s forthcoming Silent Hill 2 remake will feature a playable origin story for Pyramid Head, according to a Best Buy listing. Specifically it says &quot;fan favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot; That&#x27;s pretty much all she wrote, where the much vaunted &quot;news-reporting&quot; aspect of this news article is concerned.

                              <span>In October we revealed details of a DMCA subpoena application filed by Naver Webtoon in the United States which listed over 350 &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains offering the company&#x27;s comics illegally. Late last week, Naver suggested that after obtaining site operators&#x27; personal details from Cloudflare, around 150 sites with 2.5 billion annual visits subsequently shut down. While that&#x27;s a huge claim, just one of those sites accounted for three quarters of a billion visits.

He&#x27;s due to join the free-to-player shooter in Season 8 on December 5th, but you can also give him a go right now until November 5th in a limited-time trial.

                              <span>Opinions vary on whether 2005&#x27;s Boiling Point: Road To Hell was ever, could ever have been, a good game. What&#x27;s clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it&#x27;s getting a re-release in just ten days and I&#x27;m fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.

That&#x27;s because Vessel Of Hatred is all about one of the Prime Evils, Mephisto, who auld players would have slain in that most-beloved of hack-and-slashers. It&#x27;s also going to add a new character class &quot;never before seen in the Diablo universe.&quot;

It&#x27;s set in a new subterranean world beneath Azeroth - and it kicks off a three-expansion story arc Blizzard are caling The Worldsoul Saga.

                              <span>India&#x27;s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced on Friday that the country&#x27;s film censorship board has been given powers to remove pirated films from platforms like YouTube. Copyright holders, their agents, &quot;and/or any other person&quot; may file a complaint by filling in what appears to be a paper form. The Ministry adds that if the complainant isn&#x27;t a copyright holder or hasn&#x27;t been authorized by one, individual hearings may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

You don&#x27;t need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible.

                              <span>Fortnite’s nostalgic latest season has kicked off, bringing back a slew of weapons, vehicles, items and cosmetics from the battle royale game’s first chapter. The truncated Fortnite Chapter 4 Season OG - which will last just four weeks, rather than the usual three months - has also restored the game’s original map as seen in Chapter 1, meaning the return of places like Tilted Towers, Loot Lake and Greasy Grove.

Unlocked by levelling up a weapon to the max, Weapon Tuning is an extra layer of the game’s Gunsmith weapon-building editor that lets you tweak individual attachment stats such as weight and length of grip, as displayed on a radar graph.

These will be tabletop adaptations of Blizzard’s action-RPG series, taking Diablo into the realm occupied by Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Catan.

That&#x27;s according to developer Poncle, who are clearly in a whimsical mood this week. After all, if there&#x27;s one thing this game about auto-massacring ever larger crowds of kamikaze night creatures has been lacking, it&#x27;s some proper narrative context.

                              <span>Readers, I must tell you something. If you&#x27;re currently playing Alan Wake 2 and haven&#x27;t continued with Alan&#x27;s part of the story after reaching the point where you can switch between him and Saga, STOP WHAT YOU&#x27;RE DOING IMMEDIATELY. 
I know Saga&#x27;s an infinitely better hang than Alan, but trust me on this. You are ignoring what is arguably the best 15 minutes of video game you&#x27;ll play all year. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and play as Saga for 20 hours, only to realise that this utter masterpiece of a level was sitting here the entire time. Do the right thing. Continue Alan&#x27;s story. You won&#x27;t regret it (and spoilers to follow below, obvs).

                              <span>What a great little thing. You&#x27;ve surely seen a hundred post-Minecraft games about building a base to smelt iron to build a base, and probably even thought to yourself that they look entirely fine but kind of... redundant? There&#x27;s only so many times you can walk back and forth from a cave to a forge.
But what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It&#x27;s so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

Released today, it gives you a massive, gloomy map full of towering, greeny-black Gothic structures that are packed with backstory documents, but contain absolutely no enemies. The only thing separating you from all that winding, lore-drenched architecture is distance. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I have a confession to make, readers. I&#x27;m mildly obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I&#x27;m kinda obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I&#x27;m weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid&#x27;s size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I&#x27;ve ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let&#x27;s be honest, I&#x27;m all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that&#x27;s been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity&#x27;s sake (it&#x27;s the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it&#x27;s also exactly the kind of thing I&#x27;d swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can&#x27;t even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year&#x27;s Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.

                              <span>Earlier this year, HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


&quot;We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,&quot; Mazin told Deadline. &quot;[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we&#x27;re greenlit proper, we&#x27;re a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.&quot;
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it&#x27;s clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We&#x27;re all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won&#x27;t happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG goes live in a few hours once its downtime is complete, and it brings players back to 2018&#x27;s Chapter 1 map, with throwback weapons, loot, vehicles, and more, too. While it&#x27;s technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1&#x27;s past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

                              <span>A new WarioWare is upon us! And with it comes a whole collection of throwback Nintendo games from the recurring character, 9-Volt. WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch&#x27;s unique control options, but it&#x27;s arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.
Join Brian Shea and me as we go through all of them and even see what some of the game&#x27;s look like when played at their second and third tier.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor.

That&#x27;s because all digital version preorders unlock early access to the Modern Warfare III campaign. That&#x27;s eight days before the full release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Earlier this week, publisher Activision Blizzard and developer Sledgehammer Games released the PC specs and system requirements for the game. Now, we have our hands on Modern Warfare III and can tell you what the best graphics mode is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and what visual settings to use.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4 has been one of the best seasons for Epic Games&#x27; battle royale in a while, bringing vampires, heists, and more to the game. But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia. 
That&#x27;s showcased best in today&#x27;s trailer, which highlights the throwback drop spot of Tilted Towers while Juice WRLD&#x27;s &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; plays. Tilted Towers looks as good as we remember it, and you can check it out in the Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG – Return to Tilted Towers gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, this chapter&#x27;s fifth chapter, goes live tomorrow on November 3.

Back in the &#x27;90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you&#x27;re ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can&#x27;t answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a &quot;talk&quot; option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong&#x27;s cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled &quot;Guerilla&quot;, but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won&#x27;t spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

                              <span>We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It&#x27;s a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

In dozens of local and international news reports, this &#x27;official&#x27; figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren&#x27;t alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government&#x27;s copy remains intact.

The case was scheduled to go to trial next year with potentially millions of dollars in damages on the line. The parties haven&#x27;t signed a settlement agreement and both will cover their own costs.

                              <span>The government of South Korea says it will ramp up efforts to prevent online piracy of valuable local &#x27;K-Content&#x27; including movies, TV shows, and increasingly popular short-form comics, known locally as &#x27;webtoons&#x27;. With the launch of the &quot;Copyright Crime Scientific Investigation Team&quot; and the &quot;Copyright Crime Analysis Center&quot; it&#x27;s hoped that the increasingly internationalized and sophisticated nature of online infringement can be tackled more effectively.
