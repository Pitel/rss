                              <span>When The Anacrusis launched into early access in January 2022, its retrofuturist take on the co-op FPS instantly delivered on funky sci-fi fun. Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.


Happily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.

                              <span>I&#x27;m playing Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla right now, and it&#x27;s too bloody big. This is my second stint, jumping back in after playing for 14 hours when it came out in 2020 then abandoning it - and I&#x27;m beginning to remember why. It&#x27;s a pretty but largely empty-feeling time, with woefully repetitive mission design and characters I only have a passive interest in. It&#x27;s good, therefore, to see Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage creative director Stéphane Boudon make more noises about how the next Creed game will be smaller and &quot;more intimate&quot;.

                              <span>When you think of object-gathering game Katamari Damacy the first things that spring to mind are usually balls, and the rolling thereof. Computer scientist and custom controller kitbashing experimenter Dr Tom Tilley had the same thought and, erm, rolled with it. In a case of life imitating art, Tilley repurposed a trackball he’d made from roll-on deodorant and a soccer ball to play the game with (thanks, Time Extension). You can watch Tilley mucking about with the trackball to control an emulated version of the PS2-era Katamari Damacy in the video below.

                              <span>What makes a good platformer? Christ, I don&#x27;t know. Why would you open an article with that. Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there&#x27;s a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You&#x27;ll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You&#x27;ll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.


So yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It&#x27;s immediately and consistently fun, but I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.

The pace is high, the movement tricky, the guns have like, 18 bullets in a clip and it&#x27;s really easy to buzz them all into thin-air. But once a few friends held my hand and taught me to be patient and position myself properly, rather than charge into battle at any given opportunity, the game began to click. And what a battle royale it is.

                              <span>Horror movie maestro John Carpenter has ‘fessed up that he’s not directing a movie version of Dead Space, but suggests there’s another director attached to a possible big-screen adaptation. Talking to Variety about his career ahead of his 75th birthday, Carpenter was asked about rumours he could be helming a non-interactive take on Dead Space. Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.

Fans are currently sorting through 60 gbs of unused Team Fortress 2 assets, including 20 maps, 40 man vs machine maps, and assorted intriguing models. I do kind of wish we&#x27;d got to play the version of TF2 with mechs that resemble three-footed Star Wars Walkers.

                              <span>Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn&#x27;t heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.
It was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you&#x27;ll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.
I can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don&#x27;t care. I adore it. And I&#x27;m going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.

                              <span>As I scale the sides of apartment blocks with climbing axes and pole-vault through windows, I often feel like I&#x27;m breaking Babbdi. I feel I&#x27;ve done something particularly clever or busted outside the boundaries of its little brutalist city. I haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m delighted to explore with this feeling. Oh sure, my objective in this splendid free indie game is to find a way out of the terrible city, but I&#x27;ll enjoy my final hour here. You might too.

Tsunamods’ Echo-S 7 mod has actors from around the world voicing every character in Final Fantasy 7, including the battle barks. You can see a trailer of the mod in action below, but if you’re watching in the office on your lunch break then be aware that there’s a fair few cuss words in it.

                              <span>GOG has decided to scrap their GOG Connect service, which allowed users to claim a limited selection of games they already owned on Steam for free. The service was quietly killed off at the beginning of this year and removed from GOG’s site, which didn’t go unnoticed by frequenters of the GOG subreddit. GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we&#x27;ve decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.

Well, Grand Theft Auto Online’s latest addition is the Gun Van, and it’s going for a similar vibe. You can flag down the entrepreneurial van driver to buy pieces from a weekly rotating selection of what Rockstar calls “top-of-the-line weapons, ammunition, and armor”. It’s pretty much just the GTA equivalent of an ice cream truck, but for guns. Witness a short snippet of the Gun Van in action below.

                              <span>Several games have attempted to successfully marry first-person shooting with real-time strateging, and to my mind none have quite succeeded. Outpost: Infinity Siege, at the very least, understands why the ambition its worthwhile. First revealed during last year&#x27;s E3, its newest trailer shows more massive scale combat - as well as confirming its name and a release window.

                              <span>Hey Yo (Yo)
Damn, it looks like the era of BRIDGET is set to continue — Not only has the Guilty Gear star made her GG Strive debut, appeared in some fun fan projects, AND received her own, real-life Bullet Yo-Yo, but merch maker Spiritale has now revealed a prototype wicked-looking figurine, currently in production.
The prototype captures Brisket in all of her glory, posed exactly as she is in her Guilty Gear Strive splash art. Rocking her big ol&#x27; shoes — Bullet Yo-Yo in one hand and haunted companion Roger in the either, our girl looks set and ready to embark upon her next Bridgetquest. The fixed-pose figurine looks very similar in quality and design to Kotobukiya&#x27;s &quot;Bishoujo&quot; range, though Bridget is also sporting a nicely detailed base as she comes kick-kicking her way into the next battle.

Unfortunately, Spiratale has not revealed a price nor a release window for the Bridget figurine. For whatever it&#x27;s worth, Spiratale&#x27;s typical character figurines tend to stand at a 1/7 scale and usually run around the $200-$300 dollar mark. So the more hardcore fans among you might have to start saving up the pennies. To be clear, this price is pure speculation on my part, merely based on the company&#x27;s previous releases. We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when Bridget is ready for pre-order.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port arrives this spring.

Every so often, things pass us by. October in particular was a packed month, full of games like Vampire Survivors, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, A Plague Tale 2, Alan Wake Remastered Switch, Scorn, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, NHL 23, and No Man&#x27;s Sky Switch: to name a few (and in this case, I&#x27;m being literal, comparatively!).
So it makes sense that Gotham Knights would slip through the cracks, especially when codes were semi-limited for it at the time. It&#x27;s time for Gotham&#x27;s crew to face the music.

                              <span>It&#x27;ll run through January 15
A few weeks back, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet players had the opportunity to take down Cinderace in a 7-star Tera Raid (Fighting Tera type) and earn the Pokemon for themselves. Just like the Charizard event, there&#x27;s a second chance weekend.
That second chance kicks off today (right now actually), and will run through January 15. You have roughly two full days to unlock 7-star raids if you haven&#x27;t already, then locate and take down the Cinderace. As a reminder you can only get one Cinderace per save file, but you can take the raid on an unlimited amount of times to amass rewards, and you can breed that Cinderace into a Scorbunny.
If you still aren&#x27;t raid-ready, it&#x27;s currently unknown if this Cinderace will be distributed again in the future. Right now all we have to go with is wording on the Charizard news post (which Cinderace did not get), which technically only applies to Charizard currently: &quot;Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future.&quot;
You still have time if you haven&#x27;t clean up that postgame path to 7-star raids yet! With a strong team you can get it done fairly quickly.
If you need help, we have numerous resources for the Cinderace event, including:
A full guide on the easiest ways to clear the Cinderace raid
How to find the Cinderace raid
A breakdown of the Cinderace raid rewards and Pokemon stats
A reminder that the event Cinderace is available for breeding

This year, believe it or not, sees the Street Fighter franchise celebrate its 35th anniversary. And alongside the anticipated release of Street Fighter 6, the fan community can undoubtedly look forward to a bevy of fantastic fan tributes, designed to acknowledge over three decades of fighting game excellence.
And we&#x27;re kicking off the year with a doozy of an example, as director Jeremy Mansford, audio engineers White Owl Studio, and musician/narrator Vo Williams have come together to produce a stunning piece of animation celebrating Capcom&#x27;s iconic series and, more specifically, the legacy of its most notable of World Warriors, Ryu.
https://youtu.be/FVSgnfDc3aI
Titled &quot;Fight Your Rival&quot;, the gorgeous, 80-second animated film captures the wandering hero&#x27;s journey through the franchise, from the early mastery of the martial arts, through his battles with the Four Kings of Shadaloo, the war with his inner demons, powered by the frightening form of the Satsui no Hado. The animation ends with his twilight era, which sees Ryu a wiser, more spiritually content warrior who — despite his advancing years — will never cease pursuing the thrill of the fight. Not until his final breath.
And with a whole new generation of opponents awaiting him, it seems that the fight is far from over.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Epic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis for its huge army of users — Available to download from January 19 to all users, it&#x27;s the unique, narratively driven Epistory: Typing Chronicles.
Developed by Belgian studio Fishing Cactus and released back in 2016, Epistory is the tale of a young girl, who rides a three-tailed fox around a constantly evolving origami world, under attack from an array of paper spiders and other crease-tastic bugs. Epistory: Typing Chronicles is a particularly original title from both an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. Not only is its delightful paper world incredibly cool and inviting, but the game&#x27;s story and world unfolds, (quite literally), via the player&#x27;s typing ability. It&#x27;s a unique, smartly conceived concept, which you can see in action for yourself in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;O1qg_8JKojE&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;FishingCactus
The player follows on-screen typing prompts in order to control our hero, defeat their enemies, and advance the core story itself. Much like other word-based video games, such as The Typing of the Dead, speed and accuracy will be the tools necessary to progress through the adventure, accessing new areas, while protecting our foxy friend from an increasingly aggressive army of bugs. Epistory is a very novel release, and almost worth the price of admission alone for its beautifully crafted origami universe.
Epistory: Typing Chronicles will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 19. Until then, you can still pick up murder mystery freebie First Class Trouble from the EGS dashboard.

                              <span>Did they only just hear about it?
In the latest chapter of a story set to run throughout 2023 and beyond, industry giants Google and Nvidia have reportedly expressed concern to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard by publisher Microsoft.
According to a new report by Bloomberg, internet developer Google and graphics card company Nvidia have both provided the FTC with testimony in preparation for the latter&#x27;s upcoming lawsuit, filed against Microsoft in early December 2022. It is reported that the testimony demonstrates concern that the purchase could give Microsoft an unfair advantage in regards to lucrative issues such as gaming subscription services, mobile gaming content, and cloud gaming support.
The supposed complaints from Google and Nvidia would join the previously aired opposition from Sony, which is most likely concerned over the possibility of losing access to Activision&#x27;s billion-dollar shooter franchise Call of Duty. Should the lawsuit go to trial, which at this point seems incredibly likely, then spokespeople for all three companies could, in theory, be called as witnesses for the FTC&#x27;s case. And that&#x27;s a particularly mighty trio of brands to face down, even for Microsoft.
Microsoft needs to find favor of the FTC before its $68.7 billion dollar purchase of Activision Blizzard can go ahead. Even once the lawsuit clears, MS would still need to seek approval from other global regulators, including the European Commission and the UK Market Authority. Furthermore, regardless of the result of the trial, both parties have the option to appeal the judge&#x27;s decision, seemingly guaranteeing this debacle will run into the tail-end of the year and perhaps even into 2024.

                              <span>Fork over that extra dollar
HBO has always been one of the pricier streaming services, but with shows like Succession, White Lotus, and the show that arguably kicked off the current golden era of television, The Sopranos, you&#x27;re basically always guaranteed to get a good bang for your buck. We&#x27;ll have to see if that holds true after yet another price increase, because the cost of HBO Max has risen yet again.
The change went into effect today, January 12, making the service&#x27;s former $14.99/month price for the ad-free tier has increased $1 to $15.99. It&#x27;s the first price hike since the launch of HBO Max back in March of 2020.

While it&#x27;s impossible to know for sure why the company decided to raise the price, there&#x27;s a chance that they&#x27;re simply keeping up with the rising costs of inflation, especially after their competitors like Netflix have done the same. Of course, it does seem a bit convenient that this change is happening only days before the premiere of The Last of Us TV adaptation on HBO Max, which will likely be one of the biggest streaming events of the year.
The show has been receiving rave reviews from critics, and as a fan of the series myself, I&#x27;ll be interested to see how they translate such a beloved game to a live action television format. Here&#x27;s hoping the price increase is worth it.

It has officially been one year, two months, and nine days (and counting) since Nintendo has made any significant content updates to its second-most successful game in history — Animal Crossing: New Horizons. So, on January 4th, YouTuber NintenTalk released a challenge to their viewers to &quot;Make Animal Crossing: New Horizons fun again&quot; by introducing what they have dubbed #ACNHHardMode.

Update : A few weeks after the Japanese demo dropped on the eShop, you can now download the Dragon Quest Treasures demo from the North American and European eShop!
We thought this would happen eventually, and Square Enix confirmed earlier today (via the official Dragon Quest Twitter) that the demo is ready to download. And just like the Japanese demo, you can carry your save data over.

Surprise! Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood is now open! Technically. Like many other theme parks, the new park is going through a &quot;soft opening&quot;, so it&#x27;s not officially open as such; rather, it&#x27;s available to members of the public but with the discretion that entry may be limited at any time and guest numbers may be capped.
Members of the Universal park-themed website Inside Universal have managed to get inside the park, which &quot;opened&quot; yesterday ahead of the proper launch on 17th February.

We&#x27;ve finally done it. After starting every article that concerns either Story of Seasons or Harvest Moon with a potted explainer of the schism between Natsume and Marvelous XSEED, we&#x27;ve finally sat down and put (electronic) pen to (electronic) paper and written out a long-form explanation of what &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; and &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; actually mean. Phew. Let&#x27;s get into it...

We have a little over a month to go before Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe flies onto the Switch. This is bound to be an exciting time for those of us who love Kirby and are a fan of the 2011 Wii game, but there will also be many out there who can&#x27;t help but think, &quot;wait, didn&#x27;t we only just get a new Kirby game like yesterday?&quot;
Generally, those who are having such thoughts are correct — obviously, we didn&#x27;t actually get a new Kirby title yesterday, but we get the idea all the same. Just last year we got Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet (two very fun titles, we must admit), so to have another addition to the puffball pantheon so soon feels like, simply put, a lot.

If you&#x27;ve ever seen the 1983 version of Scarface starring the excellent Al Pacino, then you&#x27;ll know what a mischievous, rambunctious fellow that Tony Montana is. He&#x27;s got quite the temper on him, and we reckon a few video game sessions would go a long way to helping him calm down a bit.
It seems that photographer &#x27;Dwayne Shoots Toys&#x27; agrees and has created a remarkable photo depicting a toy version of Tony Montana playing Duck Hunt on the NES. Check it out:

As popular as streaming is nowadays, a number of companies enforce a certain set of rules when it comes to new-release games. The Japanese company Atlus is one that&#x27;s done this time and time again with games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Persona 5 Royal, and now it&#x27;s released its guidelines for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. This information comes from the company&#x27;s Japanese website, so the rules may be slightly different here in the west.
Despite being enhanced re-releases from 2009 and 2012, it&#x27;s still asking streamers to be courteous of viewers by placing spoiler warnings in their stream. One example (as highlighted by Siliconera) is to insert a spoiler alert when streaming Persona 4 Golden&#x27;s culprit&#x27;s dungeon. Anyone streaming or uploading video footage of these returning games is also asked to make sure they feature the Atlus and Sega copyright.

To umožní zahrnout kód v Rustu do binární verze prohlížeče Chrome během příštího roku. Začínáme pomalu a stanovujeme jasná očekávání ohledně toho, jaké knihovny budeme brát v úvahu, až budeme připraveni, vysvětlují vývojáři.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot once said that Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2 being absent from Steam was &quot;a long-term positive&quot;. Perhaps he meant that only in the sense that, long-term, the game would come to Steam anyway. That&#x27;s what has happened now. As announced late last year, the open world cover shooter is now available on Steam after a period of Epic and Ubisoft store exclusivity.

                              <span>Back in my day, we had to pay hundreds of dollars for a high-end gaming display - but nowadays, you youngsters get them for almost nothing! Look at this $280 Acer Nitro gaming monitor on Newegg. It came out at $600 - and not even that long ago! And now it&#x27;s $320 off, for a 27-in 1440p 240Hz monitor. It&#x27;s got a cool curved screen, a VA panel for great contrast, absolutely incredible. When I were a lad, we&#x27;d have killed for a display with more than sixteen colours!

However, delivery times are 1-2 weeks, and you can now get a functionally identical alternative for half the price. 
It&#x27;s the iVoler Steam Deck Dock, which normally costs £49.99/$55.99 but is now down to £37.59 in the UK or $44.99 in the US. I&#x27;ve been testing this model for the past few days; here&#x27;s why I rate it.

The three games are a canny mix of genres, so there could well be something of interest there even if you’re not bothered about jacking into things or whacking chibi deities with a comically large mallet.

I’m pretty sure it was my first real encounter with a game that concentrated on a combination of physics and engineering to complete a puzzle, rather than ignorantly bouncing on an enemy, or trying to combine random items from an inventory with characters’ faces. Looking at you, rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle.

                              <span>Cosy photographic biking adventure Season: A Letter To The Future is out on January 31st, and a new trailer reveals a little more about the game’s story and the people you’ll meet on your journey. Season puts you in the loafers of Estelle, a young woman from an isolated village who sets off on a two-wheeled trek to capture and preserve memories from her home valley before a soggy disaster wipes them off the map. You can watch the trailer below for a glimpse of Season’s very pretty, but doomed, world.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve completed my first play through of Chop Goblins, a &quot;microshooter&quot; from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski. All in all, it took me just under an hour to choppa&#x27; da goblins and I&#x27;m all up for more of the same, to be honest. I liked time-travelling between Dracula&#x27;s abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, &quot;NICE TO MEET YOU!&quot;, in varying octaves.
While another FPS of the &quot;micro&quot; variety would be grand, I&#x27;d love a &quot;microracer&quot;. Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I&#x27;m desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.

                              <span>Linda Tiger&#x27;s career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game&#x27;s first tease.


 An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3&#x27;s host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her.

The Sacred And The Profane pack bundles in more than 350 fresh events, mostly themed around worshipping things. There’s also six new figures from the past to encounter, including the Christian apostle Saint Paul and ancient poet Sappho, all bringing their own events. You can see some of the new characters in a teaser for the DLC below.

                              <span>Achievements are now part and parcel of the video gaming landscape, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to like them. Indeed, the debate over whether the little reward messages add anything to games or not has been reignited today on Twitter by developers, with Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s lead gameplay designer Fredrik Thylander saying they&#x27;ve been actively &quot;bad for gaming&quot;. So we thought we&#x27;d put the question to you, readers. Do you agree and think achievements have been a blight on the industry, or do you think they&#x27;re actually good way of getting more out of a game? Come and tell us in the comments.

                              <span>Microsoft were hoping to complete their takeover of Activision Blizzard by the end of their financial year in June. That’s looking less likely now that the US Federal Trade Commission have published a schedule that sets dates for final hearings to decide on the merger, and they&#x27;re going to begin on August 2nd. As this is just the kick off for hearings about the case, it’s likely that any FTC decision on whether the $68.7 billion (£56 billion) deal can go ahead will take some time to emerge.

Obsidian is in peak form, if you ask me
We&#x27;re already looking ahead to an amazing year of releases in 2023, but part of me still can&#x27;t let go of one of my favorite games of last year: Pentiment. Although it was released mid November of 2022, I didn&#x27;t play it until a month later when we were in the midst of the end of year rush, so I didn&#x27;t get to give it as much attention as I thought it deserved. So here I am, taking a moment to highlight not only what a great game I think Pentiment is, but also my thoughts on how this game&#x27;s mere existence, along with its subsequent success, is actually a good thing for the games industry as a whole. Let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>A long-awaited reset
Assassin&#x27;s Creed is one of those game series that&#x27;s been around for decades at this point, and in that time, the titles have evolved a lot. From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there&#x27;s something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans&#x27; requests to heart.
In an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin&#x27;s Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series&#x27; sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are &quot;great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy,&quot; they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on &quot;character-driven story&quot; and &quot;the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale.&quot; This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I&#x27;ll be excited to check out a new Assassin&#x27;s Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.
https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864
Ubisoft announced that Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.
As much as I love hearing that Assassin&#x27;s Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft&#x27;s release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it&#x27;s a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.

                              <span>Premium controller launches January 26
Sony has released a new firmware update for its still-far-too-big-for-its-own-good platform PlayStation 5 — Update 22.02-06.50.00, which is now available to download, paves the way for the arrival of the PS5 premium controller DualSense Edge, which will launch worldwide on January 26.
Officially revealed in October 2022, the DualSense Edge is a component-based version of the standard PS5 controller, which comes packaged with various modules to allow complete customization of the premium unit. DualSense Edge features full programmable buttons, as well as adjustable trigger pressure, custom dead-zone positioning, and save states for different users and games. In addition, the DualSense comes with its own storage case, which doubles as a charging dock.

While an impressive piece of technology, the DualSense Edge comes at a cost, namely $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the cost of the digital edition of the PS5 console itself. Sony has also noted that DualSense Edge will have a &quot;moderately&quot; shorter battery life than the original DualSense, which makes the new controller an exceptionally niche purchase.
Can you put a price on adjustable Haptic Feedback? Sony sure has
The PS5 DualSense Edge launches January 26, exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store. It will be made available at other retailers, online and offline, from February 23. For more details, see our previous report.

It&#x27;s a big day for Pokémon. The series has finally crossed over the four digit mark for their total number of pocket monsters -- a milestone they celebrated with an nine minute-long video. Another piece of information that shouldn&#x27;t go overlooked, though, is that they also announced that another patch is on the way in a press release that came alongside the video. The Pokémon Company said that the update will be coming sometime in &quot;late February,&quot; although that&#x27;s as specific as it gets for now.

Scarlet &amp; Violet have been heralded as some of the best entries in the series that we&#x27;ve seen in a few years, but it&#x27;s undeniable that they got off to a rocky start. Since the release in November, there has already been a 1.1 patch to try to squash some of the games&#x27; myriad of bugs -- this new one coming up in February will be 1.2. The only details the press release divulges is that the update &quot;will include bug fixes and add functionality,&quot; but also says to &quot;please look forward to more details soon.&quot; Some players are hoping to finally see the update integrate Pokémon Go into the mainline series, but as of now, the integration of any new features outside of fixing issues and quality-of-life features is entirely up in the air.

The sinister Plague Doctor skin has returned to the in-game store of Epic Games&#x27; juggernaut battle royale title, Fortnite. The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
As noted by Eurogamer, the &quot;Scourge&quot; and &quot;Plague&quot; skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite&#x27;s rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked &quot;plague doctors&quot; of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.
While Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume&#x27;s removal, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world&#x27;s most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.
The COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a &quot;Post-COVID&quot; status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis. In total, some 13.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered since 2020.

After ruling the home console roost for almost a decade, the mid-nineties were a turning point for Nintendo, and not in a “they finally quit cocaine and got their act together” kind of way. After creating their own worst enemy by screwing Sony in an effort to make a CD expansion for the Super Nintendo, they were struggling with getting their own next-generation console to the market. A lot of other companies were touting their fancy 32-bit monstrosities, and Nintendo needed something to convince people that they were still on the cutting edge. Otherwise, they might turn to Phillips, Atari, or 3DO to satiate their need for extra bits.
So, they turned to the inventor of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi, had him put a bow around that virtual reality thing he was tinkerin…</span>

                              <span>You get a mod, and you get a mod, and you get a mod
The next Destiny 2 expansion, Lightfall, is right around the corner. And ahead of Lightfall, Bungie is making a big change to how Armor Mods are handled in Destiny 2.
In a tweet from earlier this week, the Destiny 2 studio announced that all standard Armor Mods in Destiny 2 will be unlocked for every player.
&quot;With big changes coming to buildcrafting in Lightfall, we want to give everyone a chance to enjoy all mods in their current state,&quot; reads the update. Notably, this doesn&#x27;t include non-standard Armor Mods, like Raid and Seasonal Artifact mods.
Armor Mods are essentially what they sound like: tweaks you can make in order to add some beneficial effects. Putting together the right combination is part of making your Destiny 2 build really…</span>

Things are lower key this week for the eShop, with a few indies hitting the service: both newish and oldlish. One game in the latter category is Shieldmaiden: Remix, which is currently on Steam, and has a modest amount of positive reviews. Oh, and it has a pretty cool little hook on top of the 2D pixel art aesthetic: &quot;The end of the world just started and everyone is gone. The machines took over and your only goal is to look for your missing sister in a retro wave atmosphere. Fight and find your way into the danger with your shield in this vibrant pixel art world.&quot;
Oh and there&#x27;s the Breakers Collection, which we have a fully detailed review for. There&#x27;s a few options!

                              <span>Series Drop to affect card rarity
Marvel Snap might want to ensure that they have a hand as mighty as Thanos this month, as developer Second Dinner has announced that its highly-anticipated PvP Battle Mode will be launching in the digital card battler as soon as this month.
First announced back in the fall of 2022, the Marvel Snap PvP Battle Mode will give players the ability to swiftly and thoroughly pound their pals into mush, slapping down a series of cards designed to ruin everybody&#x27;s day. I&#x27;m looking at you, Agatha Harkness. The update is expected to launch on January 31, though the developers ask players for patience in lieu of any possible last-minute delays or pushbacks.
In addition to PvP Battle Mode, the new update will debut Marvel Snap&#x27;s official rebalance system, known as &quot;Series Drop&quot;. This semi-regular event will see higher-level cards — for example Series 3, 4, and 5 — drop a tier each, increasing their chance of appearance ahead of any newly debuting characters. The team is aiming for one Series Drop per month. It should be noted that the most powerful cards, such as Thanos and Galactus, will not be reduced in rarity. As these fellas are bad boys 4 life.
Finally, Second Dinner notes that is currently investigating the rate at which Tokens are earned, in line with the price of in-store cards. The team hopes to come up with a fair and acceptable way to help Series 3 players push toward the upper echelons of Series 4 and 5 with less frustration. While no specific changes were announced, Second Dinner will continue to experiment with balance tweaks to help expedite progress.
Marvel Snap is available now as a free-to-play title on iOS and Android devices.

                              <span>Things are looking up
Fire Emblem Engage is nearly here, and we talked quite a bit about it (and the expectations therein) recently in a preview article. At this point the only thing left is a few odds and ends, as the game is set to launch just next week on January 20, 2023.
Until that time, there&#x27;s a few minor commercials that have popped up on Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel, which provide a closer look at some of the game&#x27;s major mechanics, and cast.
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 1
The first commercial provides a brief look at the setup of the narrative, which you&#x27;re probably going to be skipping if you&#x27;re going in blind. The fantastic elements and the more grounded kingdom hopping angle are briefly mentioned too, as well as quite a few closeups of bond system (including Alear, the main character, and Marth), and some combat animations. It&#x27;s short, but to the point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cj4yHLTCd9Y
Fire Emblem Engage Commercial 2
The next commercial focuses more on the party members/Emblem Ring conceit, and has a short &quot;tactics&quot; section that gives us some brief strategic gameplay. The core of this video lies in the opportunities to customize your party, which includes class types and Emblem Ring/Engage pairings (read: equipping party members with the spirits of classic Fire Emblem characters).
Multiple heroes from prior Fire Emblem games are teased as well toward the end of the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;o5D8Qakq0GM
While short, these clips get the gist of the new entry across. Now all you need to do is wait for some impressions, or for January 20 to hit so you can dive in.

                              <span>The big moment is eight minutes in
1000 Pokemon: wow! Well, 1008 to be exact, and we are counting. I&#x27;ve had the phrase &quot;101&quot; embedded in my brain since Pokemon was first released in the &#x27;90s, and it&#x27;s been hard to adjust ever since. When I first heard someone say &quot;there are over 200 Pokemon now in Gold &amp; Silver,&quot; I wasn&#x27;t ready for it. Now time has completely passed me by, and we&#x27;re at 1008 Pokemon. Just....wow.
You can witness that passage of time in roughly nine minutes by watching the video below, which The Pokemon Company just put up on their official YouTube channel today. Here&#x27;s a quick primer for the relatively straightforward clip: &quot;Twenty-six years after the release of the original Pokemon games—Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Green Version in Japan—the number of Pokemon discovered has finally surpassed one thousand! Let’s celebrate the occasion with a look back at some of your favorite Pokemon!&quot;
Of course, the big moment here is the &quot;1000th&quot; Pokemon, and that moment comes at roughly eight minutes in. From there they move on to the legendaries of the newest Paldea generation, which might be spoilerish somewhat if you haven&#x27;t finished the game yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;pa08Y-fhfTI&amp;t
Time marches on, and so does Pokemon
We&#x27;re at a crossroads for the series, especially with Pokemon Legends getting tons of praise on various &quot;best of&quot; lists, and Scarlet &amp; Violet leaving a lot to be desired, from a good chunk of the fanbase. While the team is no doubt working on the next thing already (and likely some DLC for Scarlet &amp; Violet), it&#x27;ll be interesting to see the lessons learned from Legends and the Paldea generation, because there are a lot of them to take in.

While the actual release is still two weeks out, publisher Electronic Arts is hoping to get the hype fires going with a new &quot;launch trailer&quot; for its highly anticipated remake, Dead Space. The iconic interstellar horror title makes its grand return January 27 on PC and ninth gen console platforms.
The dramatic, explosive trailer somewhat belies the sinister, slow creep and sense of pervading dread that punctuates Dead Space, making it appear something more of an action movie than a survival horror title. But, as fans will know, the 2008 original was one of the finest examples of the genre, and there&#x27;s no telling how studio Motive has been able to bolster the excitement, adventure, and nerve-wracking tension of Visceral Games&#x27; seminal work.

Having been around the rumor mill more than enough times one would care to remember, the Dead Space remake was finally announced in the summer of 2021, with fans eagerly twiddling their thumbs for the past two years, eager to get their hands on the long-awaited title. The remake retains the narrative of the original game, as engineer Isaac Clarke investigates a distress signal sent by planetary mining vessel the USG Ishimura. Once aboard, Clarke discovers that matters have taken a turn far worse than anyone could have imagined, it what becomes a violent, terrifying fight for truth and survival.
Dead Space launches January 27 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco&#x27;s impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

                              <span>Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they&#x27;re still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

                              <span>Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it&#x27;s in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn&#x27;t changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake &quot;Humanity Ends Here&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can&#x27;t wait to play it in just a few weeks.

Since Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade — or just Fire Emblem as it was known in the West — made its way to the West on the Game Boy Advance thanks to the popularity of Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, the series has filled a cutthroat, tactical RPG void on almost every Nintendo console since – all the way up to the stellar Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the Switch.
Known for wide casts of colourful characters, challenging maps, permadeath, dozens of classes, and more recently matchmaking, the plots of political intrigue often get left out of the Fire Emblem discussion. A shame, because the writers over at Intelligent Systems have put together more than a few decent yarns over the series&#x27; 30-year+ history. As such, we expect this month’s Fire Emblem: Engage to have a great story as well, despite much of the conversation being focused on the protagonist’s toothpaste hair.

Nintendo has announced that UNO is set to be the next free game trial for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in Europe. The freebie is available to download from the Switch eShop right now, but it won&#x27;t be playable until the trial begins on 19th January.
The chances are you will have come across UNO before and you don&#x27;t need us to tell you how the game works (yep, we have also been a part of those long family game nights that get a little too competitive). In one of the few differences between the Switch version and the OG card game, the power of online play lets you play solo against others from around the world — perfect for working on your skills before the next family event.

Gameloft&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play racer, Disney Speedstorm, might not have a specific release date set for it just yet, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that we are being kept in the dark in regard to which classic Disney characters will be donning a racing suit and heading to the tracks.
It seems that with each trailer and Dev Diary, we see the potential for a whole new batch of racers. What started as seemingly just a bunch of Disney classics (Mickey, Goofy, Donald Duck etc.) has rapidly spread into wider franchises like Pirates of the Caribbean and it is even knocking on the door of some Pixar favourites with the collection of Monsters Inc. drivers.

The latest Japanese charts are in and we&#x27;re covering a slightly longer period of time here from 26th December, 2022 to 8th January, 2023, so keep that in mind as you ruminate over the figures below.
Surprising no one, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet finds itself in first place once again, bringing in an additional 291,322 copies to make up a cumluative total of 4,630,253 - that&#x27;s insane. Splatoon 3 isn&#x27;t too far behind, mind, selling an impressive 107,700 copies to make up a total of 3,795,514. We&#x27;d comfortably wager that Splatoon 3 will be passing the 4 million mark in a few weeks.

                              <span>A new 7-star and a Valentine&#x27;s-themed raid.
Two more Tera Raid Battle events are coming to Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet very soon. Alongside a substantial patch that promises &quot;bug fixes and added functionality&quot; in February, and following the Pokémon Encounter 1008 video, Game Freak and The Pokémon Company have revealed that a new 7-Star Raid is coming to the game along with a cute little Valentine&#x27;s Day-themed raid (thanks, Serebii!).
The 7-Star Raid is currently shrouded in mystery, but we know it&#x27;ll come with a Poison Tera Type and will have the Mightiest Mark. You&#x27;ll also only be able to catch this new 7-Star Pokemon once per save file. The 7-star raid will be available on 27th to 30th January, and again on 10th to 12th February.

After a much-discussed launch and an initial update which left many feeling disappointed, it looks like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is on track for another overhaul next month as ver.1.2 comes to Switch.
Very little is known about either the update&#x27;s release date or its contents for the moment, though @SerebiiNet has confirmed that it will be coming in &#x27;late February&#x27; and aims to improve the games via &quot;bug fixes and added functionality.&quot;

Ever wanted to run a Michelin starred restaurant but can&#x27;t be bothered with the inevitable stress that such a vocation would bring? Then Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator might be the game for you.
The game was initially announced last year and we&#x27;ve already covered a previous trailer based on &#x27;The Taste of France&#x27;, but we&#x27;ve now been gifted a fresh look at the game&#x27;s partnership with Michelin with a brand new trailer. Launching February 23rd, 2023, you&#x27;ll need to choose your ingredient suppliers carefully and create dishes multiple times in order to master your craft and earn that coveted Michelin star.

                              <span>Time to do your homework.
It’s hard to believe that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will finally be launching on May 12th, nearly a full four years after its initial announcement during E3 2019. We don’t know about you, but we’re already sharpening our Master Swords and ironing our green tunics in preparation; it’s going to be a fun Summer, that’s for sure!
Now, if you’re anything like us, you might want to spend the coming months preparing for the release of a new Zelda title by… well, playing more Zelda. It’s a tricky proposition, however, because you certainly don’t want to play too much and find yourself completely burned out by the time Tears of the Kingdom rolls around.

Novinářům to po jednání kabinetu řekl ministr pro místní rozvoj a digitalizaci Ivan Bartoš (Piráti). Podle něj by přesun webů pomohl zlepšit bezpečnost a chránil domény proti útokům, také by zpřehlednil komunikaci občanů se státem.</span>

                              <span>The sea is harsh, but game development can be harsher. Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate &#x27;em up Skull and Bones has been delayed yet again, despite already having being delayed for the fifth time last September. It was due for March, but this latest delay pushes it back to &quot;early&quot; in the financial year 2023-24, which begins in July.  
At least it&#x27;s (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft&#x27;s general underperforming sails. Sorry, sales.

                              <span>Marvel Snap is excellent, and when you first start playing it chucks new cards at you faster than a confused magician. That slows down once you&#x27;ve got a few hours under your utility belt, but developers Second Dinner have some changes in the works that should make rarer cards easier to snag. If you&#x27;re saving up for a particular card from the Token Shop, it&#x27;s worth checking whether it&#x27;s one of 9 cards that are about to get cheaper. 
The first &quot;Series Drop&quot; is due to land in an update on January 31st, which will also add a mode that lets you battle your buds.

                              <span>There are few games I think about as often as Katana Zero. You know when something wriggles its way into your brain and sort of just stays there? Considering it’s been three years since Katana Zero launched, I guess it’s gotten to the point where its toothbrush is next to mine. It’s not even for the reasons you might expect, either. Yes, its side-scrolling action is so buttery smooth it should come with a cholesterol warning. Its soundtrack is sublime. It looks gorgeous. But for me, the chewiest bit is the story.

                              <span>The rumours were true: Microsoft will indeed be showing off Arkane&#x27;s co-op zombie shooter Redfall on January 25th, while saving Starfield for a presentation all of its own at a later date.
All the other details were spot on, too. The show&#x27;s called Developer_Direct, and will also include a peek at new regions in The Elder Scrolls Online, along with fresh footage from Forza Motorsport and Minecraft Legends.

                              <span>Space is fine, but it could do with more disco. The Wild Gentlemen agree, so they&#x27;re making RetroSpace, a colourful yet horror-filled immersive sim set on a city-sized, time-hopping spaceship from the 60&#x27;s. It&#x27;s got creepy bug men, creepier flower ladies, and drugs that can turn you into &quot;a tentacle-armed, mind-controlling, shadow-lurking mutant&quot;.  
The Wild Gentlemen are the developers behind noir detective game Chicken Police, making this a pleasing pivot from grizzled chickens to grizzly chic ions.

                              <span>It&#x27;s inevitable that as soon as you make a list of your most anticipated games for the year, more excellent games start getting announced the moment you hit publish. Case in point: Goldhawk Interactive&#x27;s long-awaited Xenonauts 2 has just been confirmed to be heading to Steam early access later this year. Huzzah! The original Xenonauts was an excellent homage to the hyphenated school of X-COMs / UFO: Enemy Unknowns of old, so I&#x27;m feeling pretty pumped to find out how its sequel builds on its classic, squad-based tactics.

                              <span>There’s nothing like the ocean when it comes to perilous beauty. Every breathtaking thing down there, from jellyfish to giant squids to killer whales, either wants to kill you (see killer whales) or is so frigidly indifferent to human existence that it might as well want you dead. After all, you might be able to scare off a predator, but there’s no negotiating with an ocean current.
Aquatico promises city-building enthusiasts a deep dive into this nearly untapped environ (nearly untapped, I’ll get into that later) but while this game delivers on the ocean’s beauty, it’s disappointingly light on peril.

Really, though, it should be called &quot;Baos Split, Tummies Rumble&quot; as players have discovered the real highlight: a bao bun animation that&#x27;ll leave your salivary glands twitching. It&#x27;s beautiful. Magnificent. Almost NSFW.

                              <span>Buckle up, we&#x27;re talking about anime
When I hear that a new game is coming based on a popular shonen anime or manga, I tend to assume that we&#x27;re getting another fighting game that I&#x27;ll forget about within a week. I can only assume that every Naruto fan is a pro-level arena fighting game player at this point, given the number of Ninja Storm games they&#x27;ve been faced with. One Piece: Burning Blood, Dragon Ball FighterZ, My Hero One&#x27;s Justice, the ill-fated Jump Force — it seems to me that when you make a game based on a hit anime, the obvious move is to go for a fighting game.
Some of them are good, some of them are not, but boy... are there a lot of them.

                              <span>The celebration is being removed in light of recent events
A touchdown celebration animation is being removed from Electronic Arts&#x27; Madden NFL 23, in light of recent real-world events. The CPR celebration will be taken out of the game, after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field on January 2.
The celebration in question has the scoring player lie down the ground, while their teammates run over and give fake CPR to &quot;revive&quot; them. EA Sports told CBS Sports that celebration will be removed from the game relatively soon.
&quot;EA Sports is taking steps to remove the celebration from Madden NFL 23 via an update in the coming days,&quot; a spokesperson told CBS.
Hamlin collapsed on the field during the Bills&#x27; game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2. He went into cardiac arrest, and personnel had to perform CPR on Hamlin.
Damar Hamlin has since been discharged from a hospital in Buffalo and will continue rehabilitation at home.

On the field, off the field
This isn&#x27;t Madden NFL&#x27;s first time seeing real-world events collide with in-game features. EA removed former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden from Madden NFL 22 in 2021, following his resignation over remarks made in emails. Concussions and brain injuries have also been an ongoing topic for the Madden series, with some games working to address their portrayal of the issue.
And for sports on a grander scale, world politics come into play. Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from games like FIFA and NHL in response to the invasion of Ukraine, in line with its partners at FIFA, UEFA, and the IIHF.

As a result of the Poke_Times Twitter account 2023 celebration, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet now have a number of free item codes you can plug right into the game for bonus gifts. While this promotion ends in the middle of the month of January you do have some time to enter them; and the rewards aren&#x27;t anything wild like a free unique Pokemon.

If you miss out, it&#x27;s no big deal. These codes just provide you with a random item from the following table:
x1 Stardust (1,500 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Star Piece (6,000 Pokedollar sell price)
x1 Comet Shard (12,500 Pokedollar sell price)
All of these items can be sold to vendors for free Pokedollars (cash). If you need help redeeming them, you can find a full mystery gift walkthrough here. The gist is that you&#x27;ll need to fully complete the tutorial (to the point where the treasure hunt begins, after the academy portion) to redeem mystery gifts.
After that, you&#x27;ll be able to acquire them at any time using online distribution methods, as well as codes (like the aforementioned item drops). Enjoy!

                              <span>My two favorite things: gaming and sustainability
Microsoft has made it clear over the past few years that they&#x27;re making an effort to help out the planet, and their newest movement toward their goal of being a &quot;carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste&quot; company takes the form of a brand new update that will impact how Xbox consoles consume power. The update will make Xbox consoles &quot;carbon aware,&quot; similar to an update that affected Windows 11 that was released last year.
Upon a one-time download, the new Xbox update will automatically apply changes to the console&#x27;s settings when it boots up. Major changes include consoles updating automatically to the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which means power consumption will be reduced while the console is turned off. This setting will cause the console to boot more slowly, but it will save 20x the amount of energy while active, Microsoft says. In addition, the Xbox will not wake at its usual nightly hours of 2-6am for maintenance, and will instead wake to perform updates at any time that uses the most renewable energy.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1613219312709554176
Of course, these settings are entirely optional, and players can turn them off any time they choose. The aforementioned updates will be automatically applied for Xbox Insiders as of today, but Microsoft did include instructions for non-Insiders to implement these changes on their own when they become available in the future. For a full breakdown of these instructions and details of the entire carbon aware update, check out this post on the official Xbox blog.

This release will be the latest in a long, long line of Dragon Quest titles released for mobile devices. These games have ranged from rereleases of Dragon Quest classics, to an abundance of free-to-play RPGs, monster trainers, and geolocation titles. Many of these modern releases have ended service within two-to-three years of launch. The most recent release in this medium, Dragon Quest Tact, launched in North America in January 2021 and remains currently operational.
We&#x27;ll soon find out whether this new release is a full premium RPG or another flash-in-the-pan F2P title.

                              <span>The OG Zelda game like we&#x27;ve never seen it before
Of all the games to be modded into VR, the original Legend of Zelda game was near the bottom of my list in terms of expectations. Usually when a game goes VR, it&#x27;s already got a 3D art style, but I have to admit adding a whole new dimension to a title, especially such a classic one, is a really intriguing idea. Now we get a chance to see what that experience is like, because Japanese modder and retro gaming enthusiast Sugar Noe posted a video of themselves playing The Legend of Zelda to both Twitter and YouTube, as originally reported by Nintendo Life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5vNA8-UE780
In 2021, a user named DeTwelve created a mod called The Legend of Doom, which faithfully recreates The Legend of Zelda in the engine of the original Doom. Then Sugar Noe took that mod and made their own tweaks so that it would be playable on a Quest VR headset. This thing has layers, but the final result has to make for one of the most immersive Zelda experiences ever.
I played through The Legend of Zelda with a friend a few years ago on his SNES Classic, but admittedly I wasn&#x27;t too intrigued considering how much the game showed its age, if you can pardon my blasphemy. We never finished it, but I will say that the added twist of playing it in VR might just be the push I need to get the very first Zelda game under my belt once and for all.

                              <span>The adventure returns February 17
Bandai Namco has released a new gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming RPG Tales of Symphonia Remastered, which will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on February 17.
The epic anime adventure, a remix of the 2003 Nintendo GameCube classic, tells a typical tale of a mysterious &quot;Chosen One&quot; who is prophesized to one day rise up from the people and save the land from impending doom. And when that doom finally arrives in the form of parallel worlds Sylvarant and Tethe&#x27;alla, young hero Lloyd Irving realizes that doing the right thing doesn&#x27;t always work both ways...

The new remaster features a variety of aesthetic and technical overhauls, including enhanced graphics, a modernized control system, retweaked balance, and a variety of additional features to further polish the beloved GameCube adventure. Tales of Symphonia Remastered supports up to four players in co-op action, as you and your energetic party travel the lands, battle beasties, and attempt to alter the fate of not one, but two worlds and the people that reside within them.
If you&#x27;re too young for the original title, or you simply never got around to checking it out, then this new remaster will offer a fresh opportunity. Held in very high regard by both critics and players of its time, this anime escaped will be worth a peek for anybody with a fondness for the classic approach to adventure gaming.
Tales of Symphonia Remastered launches February 17 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

Peanut butter and jelly. Batman and Robin. Video games and bugs. There are just some things that go together. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good or how polished a video game is — these days, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get through one without encountering a bug in one way or another, even if we don&#x27;t realize it. Even in games that get a ton of continued support after launch, like Stardew Valley, which also happens to be one of my most played and loved games of all time, it&#x27;s inevitable to encounter a glitch every now and again.
Squashing bugs in game development often becomes a race against a deadline as more and more issues pop up, and it seems increasingly common these days that games are shipping with glaring issues because they can simply be fixed with…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced an Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct, a new games showcase &quot;providing fans an inside look at some of the games coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass over the next few months.&quot; 
It will air on January 25 and feature Xbox studios like Arkane Austin, Mojang Studios, Turn 10 Studios, and ZeniMax Online Studios. This Developer Direct will &quot;focus on big features, extended gameplay showcases, and the latest info for Xbox games launching in the next few months,&quot; including The Elder Scrolls Online, Forza Motorsport, Minecraft Legends, and Redfall. 
You might notice a big galaxy-sized absence in this lineup: Starfield. Fret not, Xbox says a standalone Starfield show is in the works &quot;to dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive&quot; into the game. 
As for what to expect for each game, Xbox has detailed that too. For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023&#x27;s major chapter update, &quot;including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game&#x27;s biggest update this year.&quot; A full &quot;ESO Chapter Reveal Event&quot; will follow this Developer Direct. On the Forza Motorsport side of things, Turn 10 Studios will be sharing more gameplay and new details about the game. 
Mojang Studios will showcase a new look into Minecraft Legends&#x27; upcoming PvP multiplayer experience and Arkane Austin will &quot;showcase several minutes of gameplay&quot; from Redfall, including both single player and multiplayer gameplay. Fans can expect to learn more about combat, customization, bosses, the open world, and more, according to Xbox. 
The Xbox and Bethesda Developer Direct airs on Wednesday, January 25, at 12 p.m. PT/ 3 p.m. ET.

                              <span>Ubisoft has canceled three unannounced games, the company has revealed in its latest financial update. It has also delayed Skull and Bones, which has already been delayed several times in the past. 
The company cites &quot;major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles that can reach players across the globe, across platforms and business models.&quot; It says that over the last four years, its strategy has been about building &quot;long-lasting live games and adapting our strongest franchises&quot; like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and The Division &quot;to converging trends to make them truly global brands.&quot;

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn&#x27;t sure why. 
During a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,&quot; according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. 
According to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, &quot;There&#x27;s been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.&quot; 
The talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a &quot;PS5 exclusive for six months.&quot; Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida&#x27;s recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. 
Final Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this &quot;Ambition&quot; trailer that reveals more about Valisthea&#x27;s kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game&#x27;s boss fights.

                              <span>Subnautica sees you play as the lone survivor of a space crew whose ship has crash-landed in the middle of a vast alien ocean. To survive, you&#x27;ll need to dip into the sea and use your trusty knife to carve kelp and mine rocks to slowly kit yourself out in gear that&#x27;ll help you survive betterer. But most importantly, dip furtherer.

                              <span>As anyone who’s played Bethesda’s fantasy RPG might tell you, it can get lonely being the only Dragonborn in Skyrim. How wonderful, then, that one modder has bestowed upon the denizens of Tamriel’s chillest, chilliest province the ability to use their very own Dragon Shouts. Now any speaking NPC in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim can let rip with a big old Fus Ro Dah and fire you straight into the sky, thanks to the Everyone Is The Dragonborn mod. Truly, egalitarianism in action.

                              <span>I appreciate when a mod knows the idea at its core, and makes just enough effort to realise that vision and release the mod. Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I&#x27;m delighted by a mod for 2017&#x27;s Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn&#x27;t be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That&#x27;s the joke.

Sam &amp; Max: The Devil’s Playhouse Remastered hails from Skunkape Games, who describe themselves as “owners and caretakers&#x27;&#x27; of the Sam &amp; Max games that Telltale developed. Skunkape are made up of some former Telltale devs, so there’s a nice bit of continuity there. You can watch a teaser for the remaster below.

Other sources also told GI.Biz that around 20 staff from several departments were omitted, including senior developers, leads, and directors, some of whom had worked at the studio for more than a year.

                              <span>If you caught our 101 most anticipated games list at the end of last week, you&#x27;ll know that 2023 is the year that every dev and their dog is going to space. The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive&#x27;s Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it&#x27;s going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. 
&quot;You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry,&quot; he tells me. &quot;We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention.&quot;

                              <span>If you’ve been waiting patiently to slay some vampires with your pals then you might only have a few more weeks to go until a release date for Redfall is revealed. Windows Central report that an Xbox showcase could be lined up for January 25th at 8pm GMT/9pm CET/12pm PT, but that might still change. It’s believed that this stream will focus on Arkane’s co-op horror shooter, which was originally due to launch in summer last year before a delay into 2023.

                              <span>Last month CJ reported that we might see a demo for Forspoken, Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming action RPG with magic-infused parkour. A demo did indeed come out in December, but only on PS5 - and to very mixed reviews. It&#x27;s a shame, because the world on show in its latest cinematic trailer looks appetisingly stylish.

We&#x27;re creeping ever closer to the hit survival sequel&#x27;s February 23rd release date, but IGN have lead the foray with a hands-on preview that reveals a little more about what to expect. Expect mutants with improved AI and individual tastes, better building, and companions you can boss around.

                              <span>Watching people play FromSoftware games with novel input set ups is one of my favourite genres of internet shenanigan, so it&#x27;s a treat to see streamer MissMikkaa simultaneously beat Elden Ring with both a dance mat and a controller. That&#x27;s two instances of Elden Ring at once, to be clear, with Mikaa slaying the final boss on a PS5 with a controller mere moments before killing his counterpart on a PC hooked up to a dance mat. Two old rings, coming right up.

Spoilers: the surprise is an ambush from Combine soldiers and antlions, sent to welcome you after your helicopter crashes in Half-Life 2 mod Evacuation. There are zombies, too. Maybe today was not the best day to go down to the woods.

The Metroidvania is being developed by Shared Memories, another name for solo dev Billy Basso. Basso is crafting a multi-layered puzzle horror platformer that he hopes will keep people playing the game for years, and collaborating to solve its mysteries. You can see a bit more of what to expect from Animal Well in the preview video below.

                              <span>Tiny Echo by Shelter developers Might and Delight is a real hidden gem. It’s very in line with what the studio is known for - creating beautiful handcrafted worlds complete with stories about nature - but with Tiny Echo, instead of making an animal game featuring a group of cute critters trying to survive the brutal wilderness (and that most likely made you cry), the Stockholm team went completely left-field and created a bite-sized ethereal puzzler that deals with ghosts and spirits.

                              <span>There’s only a few weeks until EA Motive’s reimagining of the original Dead Space stalks onto PC, but anyone pre-ordering the game on Steam will also nab a copy of Dead Space 2. This seems to be exclusive to Valve’s storefront, as the Epic Games Store isn’t listing the offer on their pre-order page for the Dead Space remake. Oh, and even though Dead Space 2’s been available for more than a decade you’ll have to wait until the Dead Space remake goes live to play your complimentary copy.

                              <span>Amidst the fanciful flying cars and smart dog collars of CES 2023, Sony used their time at the Las Vegas technology show to announce Project Leonardo: a highly adaptive PS5 controller kit designed, much like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, to make it easier for people with disabilities to play games. Unlike the standard PS5 DualSense controller, however, Project Leonardo won’t be compatible with the PC when it eventually launches.


In a response to tech site Digital Trends, Sony Interactive Entertainment confirmed that the kit – which allows for extensive customisation of button layouts and joystick positioning – will be built exclusivly for the PS5, with no native support for the PC or older consoles like the PS4.

It&#x27;s a concerning development for voice actors, as well as anyone who could be duped into thinking they&#x27;re on the phone with a relative who desperately needs their card details. I&#x27;m usually struck by the impressiveness of new AI tricks before I think about their negative implications, but I found this unsettling from the off.

Now it&#x27;s all fresh and confusing again with the launch of its latest paid expansion today, adding a whole new lineup of pets to recruit. This here Golden Pack is another pleasant escalation of complexity across the game&#x27;s life, a pack for professional petpeople.

Miller will oversee a few weeks of reshoots for Borderlands while Roth begins work on a horror movie called Thanksgiving.

Mod developer WolfCl0ck has made some adjustments to the map, called Zombie_City, and uploaded it online for people to play. WolfCl0ck claims this map is related to the prototype of Left 4 Dead, back when Turtle Rock was calling the project Terror Strike. You can watch the Zombie City mod in action below.

                              <span>These days, box offices are dominated by comic-book and superhero movies from Marvel and DC. Unfortunately, while superhero movies have improved dramatically over the last decade, superheroes haven’t been as powerful in the realm of video games. In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.
While not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences.

                              <span>Weapon durability and its application in games have long been hot topics amongst players. Some love it, some are fine with it, and others hate it. And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn&#x27;t mind it at all, personally). 
Love it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that&#x27;s okay because when it&#x27;s done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011&#x27;s Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…</span>

                              <span>Several games have been accused of being little more than spreadsheets, but few have decided to lean into the allegation. That&#x27;s what EVE Online is doing later this year though, when developers CCP release their own Microsoft Excel plug-in.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a sorry state, prompting rending of garments by gamers and a class action lawsuit from CD Projekt Red investors. That suit alleged that CDPR had &quot;made materially false or misleading statements&quot; regarding the game, particularly as related to the condition of its console release, and sought damages.

Now a proposed settlement has been approved by a federal judge in California&#x27;s Central District. The settlement reached will see CDPR pay out $1.85 million USD (around £1.52m GBP), or roughly $0.49 per eligible share.

But next week, then we&#x27;ll properly be back. Still, even this ragtag skeleton crew have managed to reel off 101 games we&#x27;re looking forward to in 2023 (admittedly some are likely/hopefully this year). I am delighted that so many of these are new to me. And heck, that&#x27;s definitely missing a few too. Game on, games. While we wait for those, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>In November 2021, a copyright lawsuit against pirate IPTV service ChitramTV ended in a $31m judgment in favor of plaintiff DISH Network. Almost immediately, however, the court withdrew judgment against the only defendant known to DISH. Since then, he has been conducting his own defense while making a mockery of the legal system. The judge&#x27;s words, not ours.

Other infringement claims stand, and the case will continue.

                              <span>This week, a Danish court convicted a 26-year-old man for selling pirated digital copies of textbooks. The seller received a suspended jail sentence and was ordered to pay damages. While this incident has been dealt with, anti-piracy group Rights Alliance signals a broader piracy habit among students that has rightsholders worried.

It&#x27;s about adding symbols to a slot machine, rather than removing monsters from a dungeon. You emerge from each run with sentences less like &#x27;damn, if only I&#x27;d picked more block cards&#x27; and more like &#x27;damn, if only I hadn&#x27;t invested so much in coal and instead focused on feeding milk to my cats&#x27;.

                              <span>Good news! Blizzard have fixed an Overwatch 2 Kiriko bug that let her teleport while holding the flag in Capture the Flag mode. Bad news! In doing so they seem to have broken the cleanse effect attached to her Swift Step ability, meaning she can no longer purge debuffs. The bug appeared after yesterday&#x27;s update and isn&#x27;t mentioned in the patch notes, so yep, it&#x27;s a bug rather than a balance change. Hopefully she&#x27;ll get back to cleansing soon.

                              <span>God bless the Team Fortress 2 voice actors, who continue to enrich the internet with their nonsense. We&#x27;ve seen them lark about on a ferry. We&#x27;ve seen them confuse bakery staff, and amuse the guy behind a counter at a convenience store. Now, we get to see them perform an ABBA parody celebrating sandwiches. The Sniper plays banjo, and the Pyro&#x27;s contributions are soul warming. Enjoy.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try not to bang on about it, but in the interests of transparency, it&#x27;s important to stress how much I loathe most soulslikes. Even the name, to be frank. So when I say that I don&#x27;t love Asterigos Colon Curse of the Stars, it&#x27;s not as damning as it may sound.
You&#x27;re Hilda, a stabby lass who, for reasons, must investigate and lift a curse from a big ol&#x27; fantasy city. By exploring its districts and stabbing lots of weird dudes. Aiding you is a network of semi-suspicious locals, and the kind of immortality that makes death more annoying than anything. It&#x27;s a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don&#x27;t consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed. I respect that it picks and chooses soulsy elements instead of tracing over the whole design.

                              <span>I knew Minecraft had an ending, but I didn&#x27;t know that ending consists of an unskippable 9 minute long poem. I also didn&#x27;t know that last month the author of that poem, Julian Gough, placed it into the public domain, which according to him he&#x27;s legally entitled to do because nobody at Mojang or Microsoft ever successfully got him to sign a contract.
He now says Microsoft are stonewalling any attempts to contact them about whether or not they own the copyright, and that this silence killed a piece he&#x27;d written for an unnamed &quot;global news organisation&quot; because they didn&#x27;t want to risk drawing the ire of Microsoft&#x27;s 1700 strong lawer team. That piece was actually an edited version of Gough&#x27;s blog post from last month, where he explained the situation and submitted the poem to the public domain - while making multiple references to the poem being written by the universe, and also how taking psychedelics lead him to conclude that not allowing himself to be compensated would be a &quot;blockage of the flow of love&quot;. It&#x27;s a trip.

Described as a spiritual sibling to their most recent OPUS game, the brilliant Echo Of Starsong, the exact magic combo of words that made my eyes go all wide and saucer-like was &quot;a cross between What Remains Of Edith Finch and Makoto Shinkai films&quot;, which just - you know what, I&#x27;m going to shut up now so you can watch the teaser trailer.

                              <span>Halo Infinite Forge mode users were already creating some wild maps on launch day, so it shouldn’t be surprising to see some Skyrim locales appear in-game too. If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo mode that allows players to create their own custom maps and modes. In the past, players used Forge to remake classic maps or remix existing ones. But Infinite’s take on Forge is more robust, allowing forgers to create maps that don’t look like they belong in Halo. No, seriously, what is Whiterun doing in Infinite?

If you haven’t checked in with Caretakers since its launch in 2021, a lot has changed through its 10+ patches.

                              <span>Happy New Year, folks! Crikey, there are a lot of games coming out this year, aren&#x27;t there? When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we&#x27;d have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I&#x27;ll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren&#x27;t going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let&#x27;s dive in.

                              <span>In a bizarre turn of events, it seems that Hidden Path&#x27;s unannounced Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is alive and well, after recent reports it had been cancelled. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that D&amp;D owner Wizards Of The Coast had cancelled five unannounced projects, naming Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path as two of the studios affected. In a Twitter post last night, Hidden Path emphasised &quot;Our epic D&amp;D project with Wizards is still happening!&quot;; Bloomberg, meanwhile, stand by their reporting.

In real life hacking things is apparently quite dangerous and hard, but in video games we can crack the system and mutter &quot;I&#x27;m in&quot; under our breath as often as we want. Naturally, there have been some fabulous hacking games on PC over the years, and we&#x27;ve collected what we think are the cream of the crop of the best hacking games to play on PC right now.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That&#x27;s because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.
This news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here&#x27;s what Druckmann told THR specifically: &quot;We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won&#x27;t run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn&#x27;t end on a cliffhanger.&quot; 


Druckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is &quot;more story to tell&quot; in the world of The Last of Us games. 
Mazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.&quot; 
&quot;When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can&#x27;t help but get kind of...stupid,&quot; he continued. &quot;Endings mean everything to me.&quot; 
For more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that.

                              <span>The Last of Us is not the first adaptation from video game to film and it certainly won’t be the last. But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.
Ahead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.
Druckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…</span>

                              <span>Shadow Tactics is such a good real-time tactics stealth strategy game that it rejuvenated the genre. There&#x27;s a chance you already own the sneaky samurai sim, however, and much less of a chance that you own its standalone expansion, Aiko&#x27;s Choice. It&#x27;s the latter that is currently being given away for free over on the Epic Games Store.

If that&#x27;s not enough, wonderful slapstick spaceship builder Kerbal Space Program is free, too.

                              <span>Earlier today, Goose Goose Duck had 563,293 concurrent players on Steam. You&#x27;d be forgiven for not having heard of it, however. The social deduction game was released in 2021 and is easily described as &quot;Among Us with ducks and geese&quot;, but its popularity has steadily grown since it was played by Kim Tae-hyung, a member of K-pop group BTS.

                              <span>The developers behind text-based political sim Suzerain have announced their follow-up, a narrative RPG called The Conformist. It&#x27;s set in the same universe and fictional country as Suzerain, although it takes place before the events of that game. Instead of leading the country of Sordland, this time players will guide the government propagandist Orwin through the city of Holsord, as you make tough decisions, befriend NPCs, and keep your family safe.

                              <span>The only game I played over Christmas was a touch of Apex Legends with some pals, but otherwise, all I did was watch an eclectic mix of anime and TV: Mob Psycho 100, Better Call Saul, and Somebody Feed Phil. Granted, my gaming tastes wax and wane over a year, with lengthy JRPG stints rolling inevitably into junk food like Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. No matter what, my one constant is an FPS or &#x27;competitive&#x27; game, I suppose. Games like Apex, or Warzone, or even Fortnite.
And yet, for whatever reason, I don&#x27;t consider them as candidates for the Bestest Best games of any year. I might pour hundreds, possibly thousands of hours into them and they won&#x27;t even make it into my personal list of absolute faves. That&#x27;s reserved for games, not games.

Our digital anime friends. I carried Morgana the cat around my bag for a year, so he might as well be real. As expected, then, when Atlus released the results of a character popularity poll for Persona 5 recently, fans understandably had some strong reactions, particularly over the placing of best boy Ryuji.

Your options are to binge the game in two weeks, buy the game outright, or cry. Unless you were playing Mortal Shell, in which case all you have to do is wait a month for the title to be re-added. The fantasy Soulslike had left the service on November 30th last year, but now it&#x27;s back, this time with the Enhanced Edition.

                              <span>What do you get when you blend Mega Man X, Ninja Gaiden, and Bionic Commando? You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. 
Players control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. 
Join editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.

Many JRPGs have slow openings, taking their time to establish the story and familiarize the player with the mechanics before letting them loose into the world. I figured that was the case after playing an hour of Dragon Quest Treasures, so I said to myself, “It’ll get good soon!” I said it again two hours in, three hours in, and five hours in, until eventually, I was forced to accept that this was as good as the game would get. Dragon Quest Treasures is never short on charm or style, but simple, sub-par combat and loot-hunting mechanics had me scraping the bo…</span>

In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Sony released a sneak peek of its upcoming Gran Turismo movie yesterday evening during its CES 2023 press conference, and as expected, it features a lot of fast vehicles. 
Starring David Harbour (Stranger Things), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lord of the Rings), and David Barnet (Never Have I Ever), and directed by Neil Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie), Gran Turismo is based on a true story. That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan&#x27;s Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. 
Check out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: 


As you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. 
Gran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. 
Alongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. 
While waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold.

I had always observed the Fire Emblem series from a distance, worried its strategy gameplay wouldn’t be for me or stressed determining where best to start and how to play through the franchise’s various entries. Fire Emblem Three Houses was the first I gave a good try and 80-plus hours later, it’s one of my favorite games on Switch and turned me into a Fire Emblem fan. Since its reveal, I’ve looked at Fire Emblem Engage as a test bed: am I actually a Fire Emblem fan, or did I just really like Three Houses and its engaging Hogwarts-like school mechanics? If the 10 hours I’ve put into Engage so far are any indication, I’m happy to say it’s the former. 
Engage isn’t…</span>

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed that it has sold more than 30 million PlayStation 5 units since the console&#x27;s launch in 2020. 
This news comes by way of the company&#x27;s recent CES 2023 appearance, where PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan revealed these numbers alongside words that seem to indicate the PS5 shortage might be over, or at least coming to an end soon. PlayStation also touched on its upcoming PSVR2 release and accompanying 30-plus game lineup, and pulled back the curtains on its new customizable accessibility controller kit, Project Leonardo. 
As you can see, it seems Ryan and PlayStation are confident in the supply of PS5 consoles around the world. If you&#x27;re still on the lookout for one, it seems now is the time to start searching retail stores again.

                              <span>The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we&#x27;ll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there&#x27;s no such thing as a faithful remake.</span>

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting &quot;fewer than 15 people,&quot; according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&#x27;s release last year, which didn&#x27;t fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios&#x27; continued development on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game&#x27;s publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC&#x27;s bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also &quot;built at least six of its own game studios,&quot; according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro&#x27;s shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains &quot;committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,&quot; adding that it has &quot;made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.&quot;

This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft&#x27;s umbrella of teams to unionize and it&#x27;s also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.

                              <span>Fall Guys is becoming Invincible with the arrival of skins from the acclaimed animated series this week.
With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won&#x27;t be too far behind. 
Invincible, Omni-Man and Atom Eve are flying into the Fall Guys Store on the 5th of Jan! @skyboundgames

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

                              <span>Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will &quot;massively boost performance.&quot; You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game&#x27;s performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA&#x27;s site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. &quot;DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,&quot; Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. &quot;A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.&quot;
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn&#x27;t always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world&#x27;s design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here&#x27;s hoping that &quot;early 2023&quot; ends up being as soon as possible.</span>

                              <span>New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a &quot;major content update&quot; sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!

The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword&#x27;s heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it&#x27;s &quot;just one small tidbit&quot; of what&#x27;s still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won&#x27;t be released until after that. Their release window also isn&#x27;t any more specific than &quot;2023,&quot; so it could come out any time this year.

                              <span>IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
&quot;Hitman 3 will become &#x27;Hitman World of Assassination,&#x27; which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.&quot;
&quot;We&#x27;re drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.&quot; 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
&quot;Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,&quot; IO writes in a blog post. &quot;The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.&quot;

This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked &quot;a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023.&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game&#x27;s Steam page, which now features a &quot;March 2023&quot; release window.

                              <span>Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 &quot;the year of PayDay 3.&quot; Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game&#x27;s new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a &quot;fully-fledged social heist universe&quot; set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the &quot;official reveal trailer&quot; for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it&#x27;s less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 &quot;the year of PayDay 3.&quot; Here&#x27;s hoping that holds true.

                              <span>Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this &quot;first half of 2023&quot; window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
&quot;Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023,&quot; the support page reads.
This isn&#x27;t the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield&#x27;s ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

                              <span>I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...</span>

That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022. Hopefully, with 365 chances to make a splash, one of the following titles from my personal wish list will make a big comeback after spending a year in relative silence. 
  



      
												
DokeV
DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator.

Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles. On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces. Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up, and report any issues as normal! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after the release of the first Dead Island and a little over a year after Dead Island Riptide – the forgettable and repetitive sequel that did, at least, continue the story of the first game’s survivors. Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …</span>

Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.
I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it&#x27;s currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn&#x27;t provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there&#x27;s no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn&#x27;t be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year&#x27;s Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn&#x27;t been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there&#x27;s no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that &quot;2023 will be a year of many announcements,&quot; as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It&#x27;s here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said &quot;Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,&quot; and that his keyword for 2023 is &quot;long-awaited,&quot; as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it&#x27;s Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there&#x27;s reason to believe that maybe he&#x27;s teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we&#x27;re getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

                              <span>Game delays are a part of life. You know the old saying, a delayed game is…well, you know. It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year&#x27;s Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…</span>

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir &quot;Fresh&quot; Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.</span>

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
