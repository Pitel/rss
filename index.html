                              <span>Yoshi&#x27;s Island is a new favorite of mine
Okay, so I have to admit this upfront: I adore the Yoshi&#x27;s Island series. Destructoid legend Jordan Devore and I would discuss this franchise constantly, and nearly every conversation ended in: &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s real good.&quot; It&#x27;s just a natural conclusion. Well, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe just dropped a track tailor-made for us in Yoshi&#x27;s Island, part of the newest Wave 4 DLC. Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great.

The layout is breezy and unique without being too much
Some Mario Kart tracks can employ a semi-convoluted track layout, which doesn&#x27;t always gel with the folks who pick up and play with me casually. But so far, Yoshi&#x27;s Island has been a big hit with pretty much everyone. I&#x27;ve raced with.

I spend a lot of time wrapped up in my own head, so I’m familiar with the landscape. However, I’m still learning how to deal with all the mess. Therapy helps, but sometimes looking at things from another perspective can make sense of things. 2019’s Figment tried to do just that by casting you as Dusty, the mind’s courage, and having him explore an addled brain.
Figment was not a solid click for me. It had an easy-to-appreciate aesthetic, featuring wonderful art and enjoyable music. It also had an obvious passion for pushing it forward and upward. There was a noticeable cohesion to the whole project, making it feel like everything it could be. However, it was lacking something I’m having difficulty describing. Here goes:
Figment doesn’t have enough chew.

If you&#x27;ve ever watched the Pokemon anime, you&#x27;re probably used to seeing cheeky antics, and more mischievous Pokemon who don&#x27;t actually want to get crammed into that itty bitty living space trainers call Pokeballs. But seeing it play out in the heavily orchestrated games is just amazing.
Reddit user sentrous shared a recent anecdote (with video!) on how they attempted to open up their kid&#x27;s copy of Pokemon Violet to help them fill up their Pokedex. Sweet, right? Well, the Sliggo that popped out, presumably in follow mode, made a run for it. The below video is smile-worthy at minimum, as the Sliggo just completely makes a break for it (the trainer looking ominously at us at the end just makes it). Of course they&#x27;re not lost forever (it would be kind of funny it they were), and folks are using this opportunity to talk about the time their personal Pokemon similarly ran off a cliff (and miraculously survived).
A &quot;bounty PVP flag/Ultimate Online&quot; type FFA Pokemon MMO world would be wild to see. Imagine fighting over Pokemon pink slips! It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how all the Pokemon act in the new iteration of the anime, which is playing out sans Ash. The captain-hat Pikachu is especially intriguing to me, as it&#x27;ll take me quite a bit of time to get used to a Pikachu in-universe that&#x27;s not the sweet protagonist Pikachu we&#x27;ve known and loved for years. Maybe there&#x27;s room for the Scarlet &amp; Violet cast to get a little fiesty!

                              <span>Return to the Rune Factory this September
Marvelous and XSEED have locked in a launch date for the remastered Rune Factory 3 Special. This updated version of the Rune Factory 3 heads to Nintendo Switch and PC on September 5, 2023.
Special is a remastered version of the original Rune Factory 3, with updated graphics and redesigned character models. The original was released on Nintendo DS back in 2009, the update looks to bring Rune Factory 3 Special visually in line with the other updated farming game, Rune Factory 4 Special. You can see the new visuals at work in today&#x27;s trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Se3TvrFQgXY
Alongside the updated look, there&#x27;s been some new features added as well. There&#x27;s the Newlywed Mode, which is unlocked after you&#x27;ve married one of  the 11 eligible candidates in town and opens up some standalone adventures. There&#x27;s also a &quot;Hell&quot; difficulty level, meant to challenge veteran players. Can&#x27;t say I dream about heading off to a farm and tending it on &quot;Hell&quot; mode, but to each their own.
Fantasy farming life
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the series, Rune Factory is a farming life series in the same vein as Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons and Stardew Valley. It usually sets itself apart, though, with a more fantasy setting and RPG mechanics. While you do farm, you&#x27;ll also get into long story sequences and dive into dungeons. For a more recent comparison, Square Enix&#x27;s Harvestella felt like a game made in a similar vein.
Rune Factory 3 was generally well-received at the time, and for series fans, having a refreshed entry is neat. It still feels like we&#x27;re in a swell of farming games though, so we&#x27;ll see how Rune Factory 3 Special fares in a more crowded genre later on this year.

Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is the big game this week according to Nintendo, and we have a review for it! Mask of the Lunar Eclipse released in Japan on the Wii in 2008, and Goichi Suda himself is the co-director alongside of series steward Makoto Shibata. I really want to check this one out eventually as a long-time fan of the Fatal Frame franchise.
Beyond that, there&#x27;s Oni: Road to be the Mightiest Oni, and Figment 2: Creed Valley. Oh, and a ton of other stuff below. The next big thing up for Nintendo is Bayonetta Origins, which is due on March 17.

Rockstar has announced that they’re wrapping up Grand Theft Auto Online’s story arc, Los Santos Drug Wars, with The Last Dose on March 16. This will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One for all owners of the game.
This pack of five missions will bring to a close the narrative started in December 2022 with The First Dose. You’ll be helping the Fooliganz stave off The Powers That Be. The story will “reveal the mysterious connection between Los Santos’ illicit drug trade and the pharmaceutical industry, as Dr. Isiah Friedlander returns to the fray to wreak havoc.”

                              <span>No more errant notifications
With Nintendo continuing their ascent into the online world, there&#x27;s bound to be snafus every so often: especially with first party games. Splatoon 3 had one minor issue pop up recently, and it involved friend lists.
The popular &quot;ghosting&quot; or &quot;appear offline&quot; feature has been standard in PC games/PC platforms for many years, but consoles were slower to the take. While the feature exists now on major platforms, it doesn&#x27;t always go as planned. In Splatoon 3&#x27;s case, some users were reporting that notifications would be sent to their friends, despite the fact that they had their public appearance settings locked down to &quot;best friends only,&quot; or &quot;share my status with no one.&quot;
As of this week, that should be fixed now thanks to patch 3.0.1. I told you it was a minor update! Either way if this was happening to you, breathe easy.
Splatoon 3 Version 3.0.1 - Released March 8, 2023 (Full patch notes)
Fixes to Notifications
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused notifications to be sent to a user’s friends, even if that friend’s system Friend Settings were set to only display their online status to “Best Friends” or “No One.”

If a user and their friends are connected to the same Pool, notifications will continue to display regardless of their Friend Settings.
Note: Compatible with Ver. 3.0.0 battle replays. Not compatible with Ver. 2.1.1 or earlier battle replays.

                              <span>The back door to the Front Mission
Forever Entertainment has dropped a demo for their Front Mission 1st: Remake on Nintendo Switch.
The demo will give you a small taste of the game, with the full tutorial and two missions from the OCU campaign. You’ll also be able to test your builds in the arena. Modern and classic gameplay modes are available, but most importantly: you can carry your save from the demo over to the full game.
https://youtu.be/A7B09x2Bq8A
I feel like demos are really ineffective for strategy games and RPGs, however if you’re on the fence about whether the Front Mission 1st: Remake’s mech strategy will fit your tastes, it will give you some idea. At the very least, it’s a good way to check out the game’s performance and visuals to see if you can tolerate them.
On the other hand, you can read my review. Or just take my word for it: Yes, Front Mission 1st: Remake is a great time. It has its weaker spots, but I think it’s a great little strategy game. I’m really looking forward to the Front Mission 2 Remake.
Front Mission 1st: Remake is available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. You can now try out the demo before dropping $34.99 on the full version.

It’s amazing to think that developer Love-de-Lic only released three titles that stayed in their native homeland of Japan. Despite its flash of existence, the company’s design philosophy has long outlived it. Chulip, Chibi-Robo, and even Tingle’s Freshly Picked Rosy Rupeeland all subscribe to this philosophy of trying to solve people’s problems. Joy-makers, I call them, and there really isn’t enough of them in the world.
24 Killers wears its influence on its sleeve. Its deliberately uneven visual style even harkens back to Love-de-Lic’s first title, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. That puts it in a tricky predicament because it invites direct comparisons. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, but 24 Killers has been training hard and doing its squats.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe just got its fourth wave of DLC this week, and with it, patch notes! Don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;re mostly good news.
In addition to adding support for the DLC, there&#x27;s also a series of general improvements, as well as myriad issues that have been fixed. Thankfully, unlike many other first part Nintendo patch notes, those fixes are descriptive! If you&#x27;ve been having problems with items (like the Boo and lightning glitches), you&#x27;re in luck. As for the general patch smoothing, there&#x27;s &quot;improved performance&quot; of select characters and vehicle parts, and you can now utilize the rear view mirror in more cases (including spinning, crashing, and when you&#x27;re morphing into a Bullet Bill).

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass Wave 4 (read: more DLC tracks and Birdo) dropped this week, and with it, plenty of speculation and intrigue.
After booting the update up and navigating through the menus to try out the new tracks, I noticed something odd: there&#x27;s five &quot;?&quot; spots on the character select screen that didn&#x27;t appear before! This is in addition to Birdo, who made their debut in Wave 4.
Interestingly, instead of rearranging the character select screen, Birdo appears in a brand new column, with five more slots below them denoted by a &quot;?&quot; With the Mario universe as vast as it is at this point, the realm of speculation is probably limitless, as any character, no matter how small (Goombas!) could show up. Note that there are two more waves to go until these five slots are potentially filled; and of course, this might not be the definitive end of all DLC for the game.
Who could the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC characters be?
Just based on a few racers that have appeared in other games, there&#x27;s a short list:
Funky Kong (Mario Kart Wii/Tour)
Diddy Kong (Double Dash/Wii/Tour)
Honey Queen (Mario Kart 7)
Wiggler (Mario Kart 7)
Petey Piranha (Double Dash/Tour)
This list also isn&#x27;t exhaustive, and Nintendo could surprise us with out-of-left-field characters like they did with the Animal Crossing Villager and Link from the Zelda series. I can also see Pauline making it in by the end, especially given her appearance in Mario Golf: Super Rush. The sky is the limit when you&#x27;re a character factory like Nintendo!

It looks like Capcom&#x27;s previously teased Resident Evil 4 demo will be with us by sundown. At least that&#x27;s the word going around on Twitch, where a pop-up ad appears to have jumped the gun a little bit early.
According to Twitch users, a new ad for the upcoming remake has been frequently popping up on the streaming service, emblazoned with the words &quot;Demo Available Now&quot;. Given that Capcom has a live stream showcase planned for later today featuring Resident Evil 4, it seems to be a snug assumption that the demo will drop in tandem, likely across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The tweet below features the ad, as spotted by fans @Jbiootyful and @DanisabeastXD. Lordy.
https://twitter.com/DanisabeastXD/status/1633710601271664640?s&#x3D;20
The Capcom Spotlight showcase kicks off at 14:30 PT / 17:30 ET / 23:30 BST, with a brief pre-show scheduled 15 minutes beforehand. You will be able to check out the live stream for yourself over on the official Capcom YouTube and Twitch channels, where we are expected to hear updates on futuristic dinosaur battle Exoprimal, monster... erm... hunter Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, as well as new info pertaining to Mega Man Battle Network, and, obviously, Resident Evil 4 itself.
We’ll be sure to bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid.

Inti Creates has announced that it will be retitling its recently released platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge as Gal Guardians: Demon Purge in all English-speaking countries. The action-packed Gothic adventure will be briefly removed from storefronts while the name change takes place.
The need to pull the ol&#x27; switcheroo comes in response to a legal claim from the owners of fantasy franchise Grimguard — a series that utilizes the similar sounding name for its range of tabletop and mobile titles. It&#x27;s no doubt a frustrating situation for Inti Creates, but given the Demon Purge is part of the Gal Gun series, the name change is still a snug fit.

Released last month on PC and consoles, Grim... Sorry, Gal Guardians: Demon Purge is a metroidvania-like title that weighs in a little heavier on the arcade action over the RPG elements. As noted in our review, it offers dynamic and engaging co-op action, punctuated with good humor, and dressed up in lovely pixel art and a cool, Castlevania-lite soundtrack. For fans of the classic Konami series, as well as SNES aficionados everywhere, it&#x27;s definitely worth checking out.
Gal Guardians: Demon Purge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. A physical edition is also in the works, though no doubt it will now be delayed while the artwork is changed to reflect the new title.

                              <span>Special Starfield presentation will follow
Microsoft has announced that it will be holding its next major Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday, June 11, timed with the launch of this year&#x27;s E3 2023 festivities.
The date was revealed in a tweet from the publisher, promoting a special presentation for Bethesda&#x27;s epic space opera Starfield. The Bethesda presentation is scheduled to take place immediately after the Xbox showcase, so it looks like there&#x27;s a full evening of Xbox-centric news, updates, and reveals set for that particular evening.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1633485273446375424?s&#x3D;20
Starfield, which Bethesda is hoping will be a genuine sci-fi adventure for the ages, has been bouncing around the calendar for the past two years, before receiving a new release date of September 6 in an announcement made by the studio&#x27;s own Todd Howard yesterday. The team is promising a massive-scale exploration of stars and planets, bolstered by the power of Gen 9 technology.
Of course, when E3 rolls around, Destructoid will be right here bringing you all of the news from what is likely to be a seemingly endless rollout of live streams, press conferences, floor demos, and stage presentations. E3 2023 is scheduled to take place Tuesday, June 13 - Friday, June 16.

Forever Entertainment has announced that a free demo for Front Mission 1st: Remake is now available to download from the Switch eShop.
Released back in November 2022, Front Mission 1st: Remake took the original SNES classic and revitalised it with refreshed visuals for modern platforms. That said, we weren&#x27;t overly keen on it in our review, noting that combat can quickly become a tiresome slugfest with weapons that are too random in their targets and damage.

The latest Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu and it is once again all about Kirby (thanks, Gematsu). For the second week in a row Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe has triumphed over the competition, selling 62,581 copies this time around — not quite the 189,931 that we saw last week, but respectable nonetheless.
It has been another strong showing from Nintendo this week too, with the Switch being represented by seven of the top ten chart entries. Alongside the usual suspects of Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Octopath Traveler II continued to sell well (shifting 14,085 and landing in seventh place this time), and Metroid Prime Remastered just about managed to sneak into the standings in its market debut, selling 7,960 copies.

                              <span>Spells trouble.
Even in a magical fantasy setting, nothing good comes from war. The Last Spell, a roguelite that mixes tactical RPG and tower defense elements, is set in a world that has already been destroyed by mankind’s thirst for destruction. With this unique blend of genres, the game offers up some fun and engaging gameplay mechanics, but despite its pixel art style, the Switch port is certainly not without its issues.
In The Last Spell, the action starts after a powerful group of mages have unleashed total annihilation upon the world, releasing swarms of demons that have reduced humanity to a handful of small havens. Every night, a few heroes defend these cities as the remaining mages attempt to undo the evil they have wrought by banishing all magic from the world. It isn’t an overly complex setup and the actual gameplay doesn’t feel nearly as dark as the opening cutscene makes it out to be, but the premise is a solid one.

Footage of an official LCD screen for the GameCube from E3 2002 has been discovered. The footage has been shared by Adam Doree on YouTube, a media executive who has been in the industry for over 25 years and has worked at IGN, Ziff Davis, Mashable, Segaweb, Gamerweb, and Kikizo (via Eurogamer, Go Nintendo).
Doree has dug through the archives to discover this never-before-seen footage of the GameCube&#x27;s lost LCD Monitor from an E3 show over 20 years ago. He believes this footage is &quot;probably the only surviving footage&quot; of the LCD Monitor.

The presentation focused on five titles from the Japanese developer, with a big surprise at the end — every single title in the presentation will be released worldwide in either 2023 or 2024.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is back with Wave 4 (of six) of the Booster Course Pass tracks, this time covering the Fruit Cup and Boomerang Cup. Now that we’re over the halfway point, it really feels like Nintendo is starting to kick things into high gear with not only a stellar set of new and returning tracks but also an extra character in the form of Birdo. It all adds up to what is easily the strongest DLC release so far.
Starting with the Fruit Cup first, here you’ve got Amsterdam Drift from Mario Kart Tour, Riverside Park from GBA, DK’s Snowboard Cross from Wii, and the brand new Yoshi’s Island course. Amsterdam Drift, is arguably the strongest of the tracks from Tour, sending you soaring through the air against a backdrop of farmland and windmills before you’re cruising on the bed of the Amstel River. It looks so nice.

This review originally went live in 2014, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s GBA library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Released a full eight years after its phenomenal Super Nintendo predecessor, Super Metroid, 2002&#x27;s Metroid Fusion is a well-paced, tense, atmospheric game and an oft-overlooked GBA classic that, while not as substantial and expansive as other 2D games in the series, suits portable play beautifully.

Ever since it was initially announced, we have all been curious as to how Nintendo and Illumination would go about bringing the world of Mario to the big screen. From The Super Mario Bros. Movie trailers that we have seen so far, it certainly seems like they have done a good job. The movie iterations of the characters have just enough in common with the video games that we know where we stand, but there are some fun twists in there to keep things interesting.
This process of bringing the iconic characters from game to screen was touched on by one of the movie&#x27;s directors, Michael Jelenic, in a recent interview with Animation Magazine (thanks, Go Nintendo). Jelenic was glowing in his praise for the movie&#x27;s cast, who he stated had the tough job of bringing life to the video game characters who &quot;don&#x27;t have much of a personality&quot;.

It looks like Nintendo has finished with the big character-adding updates for Mario Strikers: Battle League after Bowser Jr. and Birdo were added back in December 2022. This doesn&#x27;t mean, however, that the game will now sit update-free for the rest of time, as proven by Nintendo&#x27;s latest patch to remove some pesky crashes.
It looks like there were a couple of bugs in the game up until recently, though the main one (nay, the only one that Nintendo officially discloses) seems to have been a result of an unfortunate Stadium theme and character pairing.

What instantly springs to mind when you consider skateboarding video games? If it’s effortlessly pulling off super cool tricks, grinding rails at high speed, doing flashy spins off the top of huge vert ramps and putting together sick combos for rad scores, then you may need to pump the brakes on that board of yours a little before deciding whether or not to nollie your way into Crea-ture Studios’ Session: Skate Sim.
Where the likes of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series and OlliOlli World have you blasting along bespoke courses and pulling off big-time tricks from the get-go, this is an experience that focuses resolutely on the simulation aspect of the sport, making for a game that nails the frustration, repetition and constant failure that’s required to pull off even the simplest of tricks on a real-life skateboard. It revels in its difficulty and requires you to dig deep and assume a proper skater mindset if you’re to overcome its technical demands, get good, and make the most of its various urban playgrounds.

Believe it or not but Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty series is actually coming back to Nintendo platforms after a 10-year commitment was finalised in February.
Since then, Microsoft has mentioned how it aims to bring the &quot;best version&quot; of the Call of Duty to Nintendo devices, and now adding to this, a new document published by the UK CMA has revealed even more claims made by the tech giant.

Apart from the release of Metroid Fusion, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe today has received its fourth wave of Booster Course Pass DLC.
This not only adds two new cups and eight more courses but also the returning character Birdo and the new track Yoshi&#x27;s Island. Apart from this, Version 2.3.0 comes with a bunch of general improvements and also resolves a number of issues. Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s support page:

                              <span>Samus is back in Metroid Fusion.
A week after the original announcement, Nintendo has now officially added the classic action-adventure Metroid Fusion to Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance library.
This game originally made its debut back in 2002, and has also been re-released on a number of other Nintendo digital services in the past. This particular entry in the Metroid series has Samus and players on the run from the SA-X (an &quot;unstoppable X mimicking Samus&quot;) until they are powerful enough to take it on.

Previously, Epic had their own internal curation process for publishing to the store, but this changes from today, with developers now having much more control over getting their games onto the EGS. Well, almost.

                              <span>I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment&#x27;s surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

                              <span>Surprise RPG remaster The Outer Worlds: Spacer’s Choice Edition has turned out to be even more of a PC wilter than its raised system requirements would suggest. I’ve only been bumbling around the starting planet of Terra-2 so far, and thus haven’t seen every single weather system upgrade and character model touch-up that the Spacer’s Choice Edition has to offer, but it’s made a worrying first impression in the performance department.

                              <span>In a thrilling follow up to last week&#x27;s episode, The Electronic Wireless Show podcast today discusses sequels and serieseseses, in light of some surprise announcements of sequels over the last week (Nate isn&#x27;t here today, but maybe he&#x27;ll return in the next entry? You&#x27;ll have to listen to find out). In games we seem to accept that a series running for decades, over many, many sequels, is just kind of normal. What&#x27;s the deal with that? Would games be better without sequels? Who knows? Us. We do. We talk about it today.

                              <span>When Capcom showed off their latest Resident Evil 4 remake trailer the other week, they promised a playable demo would be coming ahead of the game&#x27;s launch on March 24th. At the time, no date was given for when the demo might be arriving, but thanks to some seemingly early Twitch ads doing the rounds today, it would appear that Resi 4 demo will be coming later today - presumably once Capcom&#x27;s Spotlight Showcase stream has wrapped up this evening. Here&#x27;s hoping it will also be available on PC, and not just PlayStation this time.

                              <span>Far be it from me to get excited about games that have just been announced, but the reveal trailer for Galacticare has slapped this management game right onto the old radar. An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It&#x27;s from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

                              <span>I will take to my grave the belief that building your own PC is a worthwhile, even pleasurable, endeavour. Besides the fact that it’s cheaper than buying an equivalent, prebuilt gaming rig, the DIY PC approach gives you more control over its components, teaches you skills you can later apply when upgrading or troubleshooting, and perhaps most importantly, isn’t anywhere near as difficult as it looks. Especially if you have a convenient, step-by-step guide to building a PC to hand. Incidentally…

I&#x27;m not trying brag; I&#x27;m being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash&#x27;s third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck&#x27;s signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I&#x27;m a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I&#x27;ve played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It&#x27;s at once both a grand time and an annoying one.

                              <span>As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

                              <span>Wild Hearts gets its first free content updates this month in the form of new Kemono (the game’s term for monsters), quests, and more. Players won’t have to wait long because the first DLC hits tomorrow, March 10. 
On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.</span>

                              <span>Eben Upton z Raspberry Pi Foundation dnes představil novou kameru Global Shutter Camera, tedy s globální závěrkou. Všechny dřívější kamery od Raspberry Pi a patrně i kamery ve vašich chytrých telefonech mají rolující závěrku, kdy se pixely čtou postupně. To vede ke vzniku artefaktů, pokud se focené objekty pohybují.</span>

The updated legislation requires online services to prevent pirated content from being re-uploaded. File-sharing service Hellspy attempted to comply with the new rules but when that turned out to be unworkable, decided to shut down instead.

Patch 6.35 is live for Final Fantasy XIV, adding a bevy of content that includes tribal quests for the beloved Loporrits. But while XIV&#x27;s bunny ear wiggle emote is mostly a fun little gesture for players, the buns among us seem to be a bit weirded out.
The new emote Ear Wiggle, or /earwiggle, is a reward for reaching Rank 8 with the Loporrits, a pretty hefty achievement to accomplish. When used, it lets the player spawn a pair of their own bunny ears and make them do a little wiggle.
For Viera, who already have bunny ears, this can look a bit jarring, as those crawling through the update have already found.

Granted, these achievements usually take a pretty fair amount of time to accomplish, so there&#x27;s still time for the team at Square Enix to take a look at the emote before the wide populace can start using it around the Limsa Aetheryte.
Still, it&#x27;s left some Viera players feeling a bit disappointed in the outcome. Given the artwork from the 2023 new year celebration, which featured Viera doing the Loporrit emote with their own Viera ears alongside the smaller bunnies.

Wishing on the rabbit&#x27;s foot
I do get the disappointment. I&#x27;m an Au&#x27;Ra player, and I&#x27;d be bummed if some sort of draconic emote didn&#x27;t lean into those aspects of my Warrior of Light. But as an Au&#x27;Ra player, I&#x27;ve also seen the ways in which the cosmetic portions of characters can create general weirdness.
Viera are the case-in-point, as headgear for the bunny-styled characters has been a sticking point. The four ears of the bun-pocalypse is indeed haunting though, and so part of me does hope the buns get an emote they&#x27;d like.
If you want to start grinding for your own set of bunny ears, you&#x27;ll need to get to work on your Loporrit quests in Final Fantasy XIV. Turn-ins don&#x27;t turn themselves in, you know.

                              <span>Microsoft, meanwhile, affirms there will be console parity
Sony is laying out concerns about Microsoft&#x27;s potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard. These include the chance that Microsoft may release a worse version of Call of Duty on PlayStation, though Microsoft claims it will maintain parity.
In a document submitted to the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) filed in late February, as spotted by The Verge, Sony raises concerns about what Microsoft may do with Call of Duty. This includes concerns that Activision could even create a worse COD experience on a competitor&#x27;s console. Here&#x27;s the slice where Sony lays out this possibility:
&quot;For example, Microsoft might release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty where bugs and errors emerge only on the game’s final level or after …</span>

World of Warcraft is getting its patch 10.1 &quot;Embers of Neltharion&quot; as part of the Dragonflight content rollout. And when it arrives, it&#x27;ll add a feature that should bring the World of Warcraft a little closer together through cross-faction guilds.
Though guilds had to stay within faction lines previously, the new patch will allow guilds to exist across the barriers of Alliance and Horde. The faction binary has long defined World of Warcraft, as the war of Alliance v. Horde raged on. But in years since, that has loosened; patch 9.2.5 for Shadowlands introduced cross-faction instanced content to the MMORPG. Now, Blizzard is bringing guilds into the togetherness.
&quot;We see this as a conservative step in the same vein as cross-faction instances,&quot; World of War…</span>

Located in Los Angeles, the new studio will be led by former Riot Games vice-president Michael Chow, who is joined by Riot founding member Steven Snow. The initial team also includes CTO Landon McDowell (Microsoft, Riot Games), CCO Jeremy Vanhoozer (Bungie, Electronic Arts), COO Tim Hsu (Riot Games), CMO Shankar Gupta-Harrison (Riot Games, Dentsu X), Director of Operations Grace Park (League of Legends: Wild Rift), VP of Design Jeff Jew (League of Lege…</span>

A piece of Nintendo history has resurfaced on YouTube. Once-lost footage of Nintendo&#x27;s prototype LCD monitor for the GameCube has shown up, years after the hardware was shown at E3 2002.
YouTuber and IGN parent company Ziff Davis employee Adam Doree uploaded some footage from the show, as noticed by GoNintendo. This LCD monitor was apparently shown at E3 2002, but was never released.

The attached LCD monitor would have made that GameCube handle suddenly make a lot more sense. To me, it feels like a distant murmur of the ideas that would lead to the Wii U and Switch. Part of the thinking, as Nintendo&#x27;s Satoru Iwata explains in the footage, is that players might be able to carry their GameCube around and link them up, u…</span>

                              <span>Now you can be insulted on a whole new platform
Sony has released the latest firmware update for its princely gaming platform PlayStation 5 (PS5) — The 23.01 update is now available to download to the console, weighing it at a little over the 1GB mark.
Perhaps the most notable addition here is the long, long-time coming integration of the Discord service, which will let PS5 users sync their current Discord accounts to the PS5 console, offering up new ways of communication with friends, enemies, and new enemies. The PS5 Discord service will also allow for game invites, party chat, and even screen sharing. Thus, it will be a useful tool for anybody who frequently plays with friends, or likes to make meandering, half-interested conversations while gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A2sHOKZCYkg&amp;t&#x3D;1s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;PlayStation
In addition to Discord, the new update offers up a fistful of new technical features. These include a 1440p Variable Refresh Rate option (provided you have games and displays to support such an option). The DualSense controller can now update wirelessly, and PS5 to PS5 data transfer can now be made over Wi-Fi (ah wouldn&#x27;t).
In a neat touch, Game Capture can now be activated by voice, allowing players to simply call out &quot;Hey PlayStation, capture that&quot; for an instant recording of recent gameplay, without having to break their flow fiddling through menus. This tool is particularly cool if you&#x27;re somebody who frequently shares clips online. I still feel weird talking to my console. But then, I feel weird talking to anyone.
This just scratches the surface of the new update, which also includes an improved Screen Reader, revised folder filters, and new library options for PSVR 2 titles. For full details on Version 23.01, check out the official patch notes over on the official PlayStation Blog.

                              <span>Physical edition hits PlayStation today
When we reviewed The Rumble Fish 2 in December 2022, we were quick to praise its unique style and great gameplay, but fairly chastised the old-school scrapper for forgetting some hugely important features — vital to any modern fighter, re-released or otherwise. Fortunately, a new update for the cult release will address some of these misgivings today.
The new update, live now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms, contains several vital online options, these include a new Spectator Mode for waiting players, as well as a rematch option at the end of each fight, saving you from having to return to the lobby and search for the same opponent. Additionally, a new indicator will give players a heads-up on their opponent&#x27;s connectivity, and will also offer the ability to reject a match if the connection is poor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JHBPAQzu_nQ&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;3goo
The Training Mode has also been tweaked, offering multiple settings for your training dummy, as well as adjustable recovery options for your meters. The Training Mode will also now allow you to save your lab settings for future sessions. Finally, the match timer can now be set to 99 seconds max, and a new &quot;Combat Range&quot; option should prevent a frustrating bug that was causing combos to drop in widescreen ratio. These adjustments will help bring the rerelease up to par with some other fighters, and a further update is expected in April.
In related news, indie publisher Clear River Games has launched a physical edition of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation platforms, with a Nintendo Switch edition releasing on March 28. You can order the physical edition from game retailers in Europe and North America, while the digital edition is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Version 1.3.0
Fire Emblem Engage is up to its third patch, though surprisingly (perhaps a relief to some) none of them have been extremely meaty thus far: this newest version included.
In a move that I&#x27;d call adding &quot;small quality of life changes,&quot; version 1.3.0, which was released late last night (US time), a few mechanics have been altered amid the arrival of Wave 3 of the expansion pass. Beyond the additions of Chrom, Robin, and Veronica: the patch also has two changes, in addition to &quot;issues that have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience&quot; (thanks for the specifics!).
For one, you&#x27;ll be able to exchange items at the ancient well in the Somniel hub, after talking to the proprietor of the armory. You can also use inherit skills in the arena. Small potatoes for sure, but hopefully all of these patches will sprinkle in quality of life changes like this: just like the prior February 8 patch added the recreation interaction to the pool, orchard, and stable zones in the hub.
More features in the hangout hub is a great thing! Though all of this might not be enough to sway folks who were already turned off by Engage. Hopefully the upcoming story content mixes things up.
Fire Emblem Engage Patch 1.3.0 - Released March 7, 2023 (Full patch notes)

From Chapter 7 forward, you’ll be able to exchange items at the ancient well on the Somniel.

You’ll need to talk to the proprietor of the armory.

Issues have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.

                              <span>Shit&#x27;s about to get even heavier
Publisher Funcom, in association with Swedish developer The Outsiders has announced a release date for Dream of the Beast, a brand new DLC expansion for its hellish shooter Metal: Hellsinger. The new expansion will be bringing new songs and weapons to the award-winning actioner on March 29.
Two new headbangin&#x27; tracks will be included in the DLC. The first will feature the powerhouse vocals of Lacuna Coil frontwoman Cristina Scabbia, who I&#x27;ve super-duper fancied for literal decades, but don&#x27;t tell her I said that because I&#x27;m shy. The second track is performed by Will Ramos of New Jersey&#x27;s Lorna Shore, who I haven&#x27;t heard of, but don&#x27;t tell them I said that because I&#x27;m super-duper old. The searing vocals of both artists will soundtrack your next trip out of the underworld.

In addition to the new songs, the Metal: Hellsinger Dream of the Beast DLC will also include a devastating new machine gun &quot;The Red Right Hand&quot;, as well as a selection of new player skins that will add new modifiers to the game. So, even if you&#x27;ve already run this unique and super-cool shooter into the ground, it seems that the new update will give you more than enough reason to bust out the devil horns once again. And it looks like the lost soul known as &quot;The Unknown&quot; still has a helluva lot more lead to fling in harm&#x27;s way.
Metal: Hellsinger is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms

                              <span>S-P-I-R-I-T! Spirit! Let’s hear it!
Sega and Two Point Studios have announced that the next DLC for Two Point Campus is coming on March 15. Titled School Spirits, this expansion will have you building educationaries specializing in exorcism.
It’s unfair. The press release used one of my trigger words: “bust ghosts.” It’s like they know my weakness.
School Spirits will take you to Lifeless Estate for your next challenge. Included are two courses with all the normal accouterments. Also included is a new janitor-focused challenge mode, which is giving me flashbacks to training janitors to suck up dead patients in Two Point Hospital.

This seems like a smaller experience than the recent Space Academy, which had three campuses and six new courses. To reflect this, the price is lower for School Spirits. It also feels like this cuts down on bloat since while the campuses in Space Academy were all unique, the space courses were largely interchangeable. That&#x27;s not so much a complaint as it is an observation.
I just wish they weren’t dropping this during a really busy review schedule for me. I can’t not play it.
Two Point Campus: School Spirits is coming on March 15, 2023. It will be released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. It’s run you $5.99 in American currency slices.

                              <span>Todd Howard himself broke the news
Welp! Like many of us assumed, Starfield is no longer arriving in &quot;Q1 or Q2&quot; of 2023 as previously stated. Bethesda just dropped a video that shared the new release date: September 6, 2023. The good news is that it&#x27;s an actual, firm date! Bethesda boss Todd Howard himself showed up on the freshly minted &quot;official launch date announcement&quot; video posted on Bethesda&#x27;s YouTube channel to share the news.
Following an ominous collective of mostly narrative-focused footage and a &quot;09/06/23&quot; numerical confirmation, Howard appears and notes that he&#x27;s &quot;so excited to tell us when Starfield is coming out this year.&quot; Howard says that they&#x27;re &quot;playing the game all the time,&quot; and are taken aback at how large it is. Todd Howard gonna Todd Howard! What a hype man. And there&#x27;s more to hype, apparently, as a new &quot;Direct&quot; is coming for the game in a few months.

Starfield Direct stream confirmed for June 11, 2023
Howard confirms that a &quot;Starfield Direct&quot; (the exact term used) is arriving on June 11, 2023, which will provide a deep dive into the game&#x27;s universe right around E3. Most of the reactions to this news will probably be some form of &quot;it&#x27;s about time,&quot; which Howard acknowledges in the video, stating that &quot;you&#x27;ve waited a long time to play something from us [Bethesda].&quot;
Given how Fallout 76 turned out, taking a bit more time to get everything right is the smart decision.

Chucklefish has announced that a follow-up to their 2019 strategy hit, Wargroove, is on the way. Wargroove 2 has been announced for Switch and PC, with no stated release window.
In a trailer dropped alongside the announcement, Chucklefish shows off the sequel’s new pirate faction. Wargroove 2 is touting three intertwined campaigns and a new roguelite conquest mode. Likewise, the robust campaign creator will be making a return.

Aside from that, Wargroove 2 is looking like more of the same. There are mentions of air and naval units, four-player skirmishes, and co-op. Both of which were also in the original title.
I bounced off the original Wargroove twice. I liked what I played, but I found it a bit more rigid than I expected. I thought it would be closer to Advance Wars and discovered there’s a deeper puzzle element to it. My brain isn’t that big, so I stumbled a bit and didn’t recover. I tried again with a physical version and had the same result. However, the sequel coming is making me think it’s time to give it another try. I liked what I saw; it just wasn’t clicking.
Wargroove 2 is coming to PC and Switch. It’s available to wishlist now, but no release window has been announced.

Bayonetta Origins, otherwise known as Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, is slated for release on March 17. Before that, you can test out this interesting spinoff in demo form. It&#x27;s actually out today, and will pick up from the opening moments of the game through &quot;the early chapters.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the full rundown of the demo from Nintendo:
&quot;This is your lucky day. Or unlucky day, depending on how you play your cards, for the Avalon Forest is just as beautiful as it is beastly, and it has an appetite for wandering witches. In the Nintendo eShop demo, you can try out the early chapters of the Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon game. As a bonus, save data will transfer over to the full version of the game, when purchased, which launches on March 17.&quot;

Yes, you can transfer save data from the demo over to the full version of the game. It seems like it&#x27;s a given for most larger IP these days (especially Nintendo games), but you never know! Also, there are accessibility options in tow: &quot;The game also features accessibility options, such as reducing damage or automating some controls, that can help anyone (newcomers and Bayonetta fans alike) enjoy the game.&quot;

Where to download the Bayonetta Origins demo
You can find it right here under the &quot;download demo&quot; heading on Nintendo&#x27;s site, or go to it directly on the eShop.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.
Today, Kate objects to another Ace Attorney soon to be barred from the console realm...

The Pokémon Center is returning to London this year when the 2023 Pokémon Europe International Championships get underway in April.
Serebii shared that the pop-up store will be open on the weekend of 14th to 16th April 2023, alongside the EUIC. The tournament, like last year&#x27;s Worlds in August, is taking place at the ExCel in London at the Royal Victoria Dock, and the store will also be at the Centre.

                              <span>The Crucial MX500 is one of the best gaming SSDs in the SATA category in my books, right alongside the legendary Samsung 870 Evo. That&#x27;s because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded.

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

                              <span>The first time I glimpsed The Finals&#x27; bonkers environmental destruction (some might say &quot;levelutions&quot;) last August, I couldn’t quite believe it was real. But it is real, and you can play it today. Following its closed alpha last September, the first-person shooter is now having a closed beta test for the next two weeks, and you can join the mayhem simply by requesting access on Steam.

                              <span>&quot;Have a go of Sons Of The Forest,&quot; my compatriots at RPS told me. &quot;It&#x27;s a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!&quot; And I was like, &quot;wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What&#x27;s going on here?&quot;
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

                              <span>Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I&#x27;ve spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game&#x27;s live service cogs to determine whether it&#x27;s running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it&#x27;s a decent time that&#x27;s perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won&#x27;t attract players who are done with the usual rise &#x27;n grind demands of these sorts of games.

                              <span>Last month, Riot Forge announced their latest spin-off would launch sometime this Spring. We now have an April 18th release date for The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story, alongside an snazzy trailer that’s bursting with sick 2D pixel art, outrageous magical abilities, and a few lore teases. The action RPG comes from developer Digital Sun, the folks behind Moonlighter, the roguelike shopkeeping-sim hybrid.

Talking about all our favourite games would take us into 3023, so we’ve kept it to two games per person, which actually wasn’t as hard as we thought it would be.

Even more interesting is that it&#x27;s coming from Turnfollow, an indie team best known for wonderful little story games like Little Party and Wide Ocean Big Jacket. Huh! Life sims are not my genre but I really like Turnfollow&#x27;s games, so I&#x27;m in. Check out the announcement trailer below for a small taste of this sci-fi life.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two have confirmed layoffs at the company, primarily affecting their corporate and publishing efforts. The news originally spilled yesterday via a Tweet from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who claimed the cuts would impact Private Division - the publishing label behind The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program 2 - and other unnamed divisions. Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”

If you hunger for something more concrete about how it might differ from its predecessor, as I do, then you might be interested in an apparently leaked list of achievements that contains details of disasters, weather, embiggened map sizes and more.

In comments outside a Pennsylvania federal court, Carrasquillo said the judge had been &quot;super lenient but fair&quot; and described the sentence - which includes almost $11m in restitution to several cable companies - as &quot;probably salvation for my fat ass to lose some weight.&quot;

                              <span>A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

                              <span>Starfield, Bethesda&#x27;s mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a &quot;deep dive&quot; into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we&#x27;re happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.</span>

Originally, Bilkins&#x27; Folly was due out on just PC but Webbysoft has added PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch to its list of platforms. A release date has not yet been revealed but the game is due in &quot;late 2023.&quot; In Bilkins&#x27; Folly, you play as treasure hunter Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Bilkins who, with his canine best friend Drayton, embarks on a quest to find their missing family that myseriously vanished years ago. On their journey, the duo will hop islands, solve puzzles, and more.

                              <span>Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary &quot;photo mode&quot; way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

                              <span>The Light Brigade has no direct relation to the British light cavalry unit made famous in the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (which, if you head over to the poem&#x27;s Wikipedia page, you can hear Tennyson himself read out via a phonograph recording from 1890 – Cool Factz!) But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that&#x27;s because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

                              <span>Happy birthday, anniversary, launchiversary, or whatever you want to call it to the Steam Deck. Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

Nate (RPS in peace) liked it quite a bit for its “masterfully crafted strategic dilemmas,” despite his findom relationship with the game. Now Mars Horizon is getting an expanded sequel, taking us to the outer reaches of the Solar System. Mars Horizon 2: The Search For Life is releasing sometime in 2024 on PC.

In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I&#x27;d have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there&#x27;s a chance of pumpkin pie.

We only have a very brief glimpse at Life By You, but developer Paradox Tectonic and former Sims boss Rod Humble are holding an announcement event on March 20th - so, we’ll see more of the life sim later this month.

The movie companies want Reddit to identify several users so they can provide evidence for a lawsuit against Internet provider RCN. Reddit refuses to do so, citing the right to anonymous speech, but the filmmakers suggest that&#x27;s a disingenuous defense.

He declared that accounts engaging in &quot;repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter&quot; will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…</span>

                              <span>Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


&quot;Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai&#x27;s deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.&quot; 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector&#x27;s Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas &amp; Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021&#x27;s League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer&#x27;s Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable &quot;economic context&quot; as the reason it&#x27;s shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016&#x27;s Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021&#x27;s Aragami 2.

                              <span>Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn&#x27;t appear on the main game&#x27;s soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don&#x27;t purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer&#x27;s &quot;Best Shooter&quot; award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve seen 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs under the £100 mark before, but never have we see one for a clear £5 below - and never this model either. The Adata Legend 800 has been steeply discounted at Ebuyer, where £92 plus £3 shipping gets you this new model capable of 3500MB/s reads and 2800MB/s writes.
Yes, this isn&#x27;t the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

                              <span>For a long time, Super Auto Pets used a strange and clever (and cheap!) source of artwork for its attacking animals: emojis, scaled up far larger than they appear in WhatsApp messages from your mum. The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today&#x27;s patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

The Lamplighters League And The Tower At The End Of The World is set in an alternate version of the 1930s where “the best of the best are all dead… so you’ll need the best of the worst.” The game launches on PC, next-gen Xboxes, and Game Pass later this year.

                              <span>As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn&#x27;t have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don&#x27;t understand! It&#x27;s disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don&#x27;t have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I&#x27;ve made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

Studio 3Division continue to say, “We realise that we underestimated the situation, and it quickly escalated to a point that posed a threat to our game.”

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ has been a big success in the fighting game scene, and it&#x27;s probably thought of as the best way to experience the famous anime in game form - complete with an endless barrage of multicoloured punches. But growing up, the Budokai Tenkaichi series were the Dragon Ball fighting games, and 16 years after the last entry Bandai Namco have announced a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi title.

                              <span>When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. &quot;Arrow to the knee&quot; jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It&#x27;s a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn&#x27;t exist maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have been as popular as it was.

This week, my eye has been caught by cute townbuilding, decapitating horror, a demon skateboarding through Hell, bouncing logos, handcrafted strategy, an entire movie jammed into an immersive sim, and more.

                              <span>Rumours of a Counter-Strike 2 have been circulating for so many years that it’s become a recurring meme in the playerbase, almost veering into Half-Life 3 levels of wishful thinking. But rumblings of Counter-Strike 2 have gotten louder over the weekend due to a report from journalist Richard Lewis which states there’s “a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on its way” being made in the Source 2 engine, and it could release with the working title of Counter-Strike 2.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines II was announced at today&#x27;s Paradox Announcement Show, and it’s coming later this year.
This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity&#x27;s hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.</span>

                              <span>Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there&#x27;s a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There&#x27;s no word on if they&#x27;ll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers.

                              <span>Seth Rogen announced in 2020 that he was producing a new animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and today, Paramount Pictures released the first trailer for it...and it looks great!
What&#x27;s especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It&#x27;s reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it&#x27;s also very much its own thing.

                              <span>Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I&#x27;ve ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami&#x27;s dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, &quot;Get Ready For Battle&quot; and &quot;A New Sparking Begins&quot; appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

March 5, 2023
As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that&#x27;s what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter&#x27;s built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with &quot;A New Budokai Tenkaichi&quot; begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn&#x27;t indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it&#x27;s exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn&#x27;t forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

The stark reality is that the site never went offline. In response, the company is now engaged in the largest, most instense DMCA notice campaign in history. In just 90 days, Google received requests to remove 90+ million URLs.

It&#x27;ll be the focus of the first session of the RPS Game Club, so all the hepcats will be bashing baddies to the beat. But I should ask: what are you playing this weekend?

                              <span>Internet provider Grande Communications has asked a Texas federal court to overrule a jury verdict that awarded $47 million in piracy damages to several record labels. If that&#x27;s not an option, the ISP would like to have a new trial. In the event that both options are off the table, Grande plans to appeal the piracy liability case.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that&#x27;s good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

                              <span>Last week, I attended a hands-off preview for The Sims 4&#x27;s upcoming Growing Together expansion pack and its supporting free base game update. This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS&#x27; resident Sims fanatic, but I&#x27;ll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn&#x27;t part of the game I engage with too much these days.

                              <span>Leaks are the bane of every publisher&#x27;s existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that&#x27;s partly why I&#x27;m enjoying EA&#x27;s approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it&#x27;s probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn&#x27;t expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It&#x27;s not that I dislike them. They&#x27;ve just never really made much impression (possibly because I don&#x27;t see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with &quot;structures&quot; that aren&#x27;t meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you&#x27;re carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That&#x27;s probably the bigger reason.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It&#x27;s been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I&#x27;m miserable and I&#x27;m staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn&#x27;t want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can&#x27;t wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that&#x27;s been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I&#x27;ll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I&#x27;m going with, will be like, &quot;Get a hold of yourself you buffoon&quot;.
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that&#x27;s big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he&#x27;s a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we&#x27;ve arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

                              <span>In the lead-up to the original Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, the team at Ninja Theory released 30 development diaries, delving deep into every aspect of the game: the art inspirations, the myths they were remixing, and more. It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel&#x27;s setting - and the team&#x27;s painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

                              <span>This isn&#x27;t technically a review, because who would review a game mode for Total War: Warhammer 3? What’s next, a title screen review? A lengthy personal essay about an attract mode clip? Can my cat get a review? First off, yes. Captain Waffles is a visceral tour-de-force that no fan of the genre should miss. 10/10. Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode. More importantly, this ridiculously expansive, years-spanning grand-strategy project exists as tangible proof that sometimes, the limitless hubris of man is actually rad as hell, despite what the ancient Greeks said. Euripides nuts, more like.

                              <span>Multiplayer horror Dead By Daylight is apparently coming to Hollywood in the form of a new film adaptation. The two production companies involved are longtime horror fixtures Atomic Monster (who have made The Conjuring, Annabelle, and Malignant) and Blumhouse (the company behind Paranormal Activity, M3GAN, and Get Out.) The film doesn’t have any talent attached right now, but the two companies are currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. Blumhouse says, &quot;it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen&quot;.

                              <span>Amazon have quietly dipped their first toe into PC componentS, listing the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan: a single-fan, RGB-lit air cooler. Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it&#x27;s dirt cheap at £21 / £27. 
It’s unlikely, though, that Bezos and the gang have been secretly funding R&amp;D into an all-new line of PC gear. As Tom’s Hardware spotted, the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan appears to simply be an existing budget cooler, the Cooler Master Hyper H410R, without the CM badge.

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. 
The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pokémon reboot. 
The Pokémon Company revealed back in December that the long-running Pokémon anime starring Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu would be coming to an end soon, set to be replaced by a new Pokémon anime with two new protagonists. The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer that reveals these two new main characters are Loko, &quot;the girl with the awe-inspiring pendant,&quot; and Roy, &quot;the boy with the mysterious Poké Ball.&quot; Plus, we get another look at Friede, who is the Professor of this anime, alongside Captain Pikachu.

Strangely, this trailer wasn&#x27;t released during the Pokémon Day showcase, which aired earlier this week. There, The Pokémon Company announced a new stop-motion animation series coming to Netflix, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, a re-reveal of Pokémon Sleep, and more.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series&#x27; history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran&#x27;s full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021&#x27;s Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


&quot;In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s description of the game reads. &quot;This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite&#x27;s only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it&#x27;s too late.&quot; 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains &quot;a multitude of secrets&quot; for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

First off, our team developers have implemented a significant update to the file access system in order to use the Secure Access Framework (SAF) API for secure file access on external memory space, such as SD Cards or USB drives. This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus occupies a unique place in the SSD ecosystem, offering high-end PCIe 4.0 performance while costing less than commonly-cited alternatives like the WD SN850x and Samsung 990 Pro. Today the 2TB size of the drive is down to £163, a 34% reduction that makes it particularly tempting to pick up.

Three people &quot;familiar with the matter&quot; have apparently said that the offer of licensing deals to rivals, such as Nintendo, Nvidia and Sony, have succeeded in addressing EU antitrust concerns.

Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

                              <span>Somehow, it&#x27;s been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it&#x27;s shaping up to be. I&#x27;ve spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There&#x27;s a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it&#x27;s also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&amp;D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I&#x27;d even go as far as saying it could be one of this year&#x27;s biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

                              <span>The next game from the studio behind The Surge, Atlas Fallen, was announced last year with a CG trailer that didn’t give much away. A few snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer revealed speedy action against giant beasts and a semi-open world desert you can slide across - and who doesn’t love sliding in games? We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

All very exciting stuff for fans of the kickpunching adventure, although, if you’re my kind of nerd, you likely got a kick out of all the film references in the trailer.

                              <span>We&#x27;re three weeks away from the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, and in preparation of its imminent launch Capcom chucked over a fresh batch of in-game footage for us to talk about. The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.


As Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon&#x27;s refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That&#x27;s one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn&#x27;t intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

                              <span>A new Half-Life mod adds raytracing to Valve&#x27;s venerable first-person shooter, a shiny slap of 2023 lighting technology in a 1998 game. I normally think such anachronistic upgrades look awful but this one works for me. Rather than just slam fancy modern tech into an old game, the mod wants to change the whole look. And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.

The Earthquake Relief Bundle is available for £25/$30 (or any higher price) until March 8th and all proceeds will be going to charity.

                              <span>I was a big fan of classic TellTale, the studio that put out episodic adventure games on a conveyor belt. I&#x27;m not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it&#x27;ll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that&#x27;s basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that&#x27;s true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it&#x27;s more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you&#x27;re more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that&#x27;ll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja&#x27;s most encouraging effort yet.

                              <span>At first glance, King Of The Castle might look similar to other medieval political sims; something like Reigns or Yes, Your Grace, where you ascend the throne, rule a kingdom, and make decisions that will impact your gold reserves, military strength, or alliances. That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you.

                              <span>The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, &#x27;let’s wash the entire Shinra building.&#x27; Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Panic has revealed that it will hold a Playdate Update showcase next week. 
More specifically, the showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT on March 7 and during it, Panic will reveal new Playdate games and more. The presentation will run for 13 minutes and will also include an update on Catalog, which is Panic&#x27;s &quot;own curated, on-device and web browser storefront for Playdate software.&quot; 
For the uninitiated, Playdate is a piece of handheld hardware that began shipping to customers in April of last year. It&#x27;s a small device with a black and white screen and a unique crank on the side of it. This crank is integrated into many of the games you can play with it.
Since last April, more than 25,000 Playdate units have shipped to customers. Playdate is not yet availabe on demand for would-be purchasers but you can preorder the device to receive one in the next wave. 
The Playdate Update showcase will air on the official Panic YouTube channel.

                              <span>Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game&#x27;s six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.</span>

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal&#x27;s story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
&quot;We were already talking about the second game,&quot; said Asmussen. &quot;I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we&#x27;re breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it&#x27;s like: &#x27;Well, where are we going with the second game?&#x27; I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.&quot; 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas &quot;that we could do beyond that as well.&quot; 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

Team Ninja has earned a reputation for crafting some of the most satisfying action games around, nimbly transitioning from the high-octane action Ninja Gaiden series to the Soulslike thrills of Nioh. Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences.

                              <span>Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron&#x27;s thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald&#x27;s recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.

Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We&#x27;ve updated the article with the correction.</span>

                              <span>Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve done [crunch], and I don&#x27;t want to do it again, and it&#x27;s not fair to ask it,&quot; Ottilie tells IGN. &quot;You can&#x27;t plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don&#x27;t want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

                              <span>Deck 13, makers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen, have announced their next big action RPG, Atlas Fallen, launches in May. The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below. 


                  

Atlas Fallen will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…</span>

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher&#x27;s battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was &quot;disbanded,&quot; according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as &quot;part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that&#x27;s been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.&quot; Be sure to check out Kotaku&#x27;s write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

Known as &#x27;seedboxes&#x27;, these pre-configured servers are not illegal per se, but when customers used the devices to break copyright law on known pirate sites, rightsholders held the server provider liable.

It&#x27;s a project I&#x27;ve been wanting to get off the ground for some time now, and finally, the Treehouse Game Club doors have been busted open... and there&#x27;s some toe-tapping guitar music coming from inside? That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;re playing Hi-Fi Rush as our first RPS Game Club game, and we hope you&#x27;ll join us on this month-long musical journey.

Such is the case with the Ryzen 7 7700X, the middle child of the Zen 4 lineup and an absolutely beastly performer when it comes to gaming thanks to its full-fat eight-core, one-CCD design. This chip launched at $399 but is now $100 cheaper thanks to a discount code at Newegg, where you can pick up the 7700X for $298.99 when you use code BTSCP2655 at the checkout.

                              <span>“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

                              <span>Earlier this month, the studio behind Deep Rock Galactic announced that they were branching out (or digging in) to publishing with their new initiative Ghost Ship Publishing. Today, the team held a fifth-anniversary livestream for their hit co-op shooter, and they also announced the first three games they’ll be releasing as a publisher, including a Deep Rock Galactic spin-off, a top-down shooter, and a spell-slinging roguelike - all coming from indie teams based in Denmark.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has &quot;lore&quot; (tedious, lowly). It&#x27;s a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I&#x27;m going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It&#x27;s also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

The open-world RPG has always been playable on the portable machine, but it’s now Steam Deck verified - meaning Valve have tested it and used their almighty wisdom to determine it’ll run without a hitch.

This news comes from a report by Kotaku which says the layoffs happened over a last-minute Zoom call, according to three of their sources. EA later confirmed the news, calling the layoffs part of their “ongoing global strategy” to expand the “distribution of our Apex Legends testing team.”

                              <span>One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it&#x27;s even for the right reasons. Perhaps I&#x27;d spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I&#x27;d witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island&#x27;s flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I&#x27;d just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn&#x27;t looking.
Sons Of The Forest&#x27;s great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player&#x27;s trust until they&#x27;re ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

                              <span>If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.</span>

In this specific segment, Clive must fight the Eikon, Garuda. While he holds his own, he must tap into the powers of Ifrit to finally take her down, and you can watch all that play out in this new NGT. Enjoy!


As you can see, the Eikon fights are shaping up to be massive, climatic, and flashy combat scenarios that we can&#x27;t wait to see more of in the final game. For more, you can read Wesley&#x27;s full Final Fantasy XVI preview thoughts here.

                              <span>After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

As you can see, Final Fantasy XVI is looking to be the most action-heavy mainline game in the series.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward mainline Final Fantasy game in the series yet, and that’s in no small part due to the person behind its action: combat director Ryota Suzuki. After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That &quot;something new&quot; turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

With each new game, the series moves further away from its classic turn-based roots toward a more action-oriented combat system. Combat has never been further from being turn-based in a Final Fantasy game more so than in Final Fantasy XVI, which is the most action-based game in the mainline franchise yet. I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…</span>

You can read my full thoughts on what I think of the game after going hands-on with it for about two hours here. But during this preview, I was also able to participate in a group interview of FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, the game’s director Hiroshi Takai, and its combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

One question asked was about why the game returns to the series’ high fantasy roots, and why it has such a different tone compared to recent Final Fantasy games.

The court concluded that the man was little more than a customer support staffer.

                              <span>This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
