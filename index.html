                    <span>A California lawsuit earlier this year alleged sexual harassment, discrimination, and a pervasive “frat boy culture” at Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard.

Growing more than 84 percent year-over-year to the tune of a staggering 83 million livestream views, The Game Awards has become one of the video game industry’s biggest events. But we aren’t just tuning in to find out which title will be crowned Game of the Year; we are also there for the World Premieres, which shine the spotlight on new games we’ll be playing in the years ahead. Some publishers save their biggest surprises for The Game Awards, a show that almost didn’t exist.

It&#x27;s been another big week in the Nintendo Life, with a significant arrival on the Switch. That&#x27;s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl of course, which we naturally reviewed for your reading / viewing pleasure. Elsewhere there was continuing fallout for GTA Trilogy with the Digital Foundry analysis, Animal Crossing kept serving up fun new surprises, Metroid Dread got a GOTY nomination, the Wii U is actually getting a new game and we&#x27;ve celebrated anniversaries for GameCube and Wii. Phew!
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

One Switch release we&#x27;re definitely keen to get our hands on in 2022 is Kirby and the Forgotten Land - a new 3D platformer that places Kirby in a mysterious setting filled with abandoned structures of the past.
With the game scheduled to arrive in Spring 2022, it comes as no surprise that it&#x27;s now been rated by the ESRB in North America. It&#x27;s &#x27;E10+&#x27; suitable for ages 10 and up and at the very least suggests the game is still on track. Here&#x27;s the game&#x27;s rating summary in full, which also gives fans of the pink puffball a better idea of what to expect.

Following on from its apology message, Rockstar Games appears to have already rolled out its first update for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition.
The post on Rockstar&#x27;s Support page for Version 1.02 mentions all platforms but the Switch in the title. The patch notes though mention general fixes for &quot;all platforms&quot; and further down there&#x27;s also a Switch-specific fix for Vice City:

                    <span>December is here, and you know what time that is: time for the RPS Advent Calendar. We&#x27;ll soon start counting down our favourite games of the year (well, counting in no particular order until we open that final door), but what will we pick? I know, because voting has just closed. If you think you can guess, do head on over to the RPS community Discord, where this year&#x27;s calendar guessing game is underway. But first, please do tell me: what are you playing this weekend?

The demonic netherworld is a barely hospitable wasteland even when there’s not a blue-haired anime boy beating up your friends and collecting them like Pokémon. Honestly, I can’t even blame these creatures for occasionally getting cheeky.

Starting tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific and running until 7 a.m. Pacific on November 22, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners will have the opportunity to go hands-on with eight characters out of the final roster of 39 that will be available at launch. The primary function of this beta will be to test out the online multiplayer before the game releases in a couple of months.

                    <span>Having released half of the game earlier this week (albeit in beta), 343 Industries has announced Halo Infinite is ready to make preparations for release in a few weeks.
#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold!
https://t.co/WUyHTqp6yp pic.twitter.com/bIbmyCParc
November 19, 2021
In a tweet this afternoon on the Halo account, the message sent was very clear, saying, &quot;#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold! We&#x27;ll see you on December 8, Spartans.&quot; The tweet was followed by a map of release times for regions across the world. Well, specifically when the campaign releases.
Forgoing the typical midnight release, Halo Infinite&#x27;s single-player campaign will see the light of day (literally), landing at 10 a.m. Pacific on December 8. Other release times for various time zones can be seen below, although note that New York should say EST and has not moved into the Central time zone.
Of course, if you want to play Halo Infinite right now, you can! The multiplayer section of the game is available right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and is free to play. After a somewhat surprise launch on Monday as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 20th anniversary celebration, 343 Industries unleashed an open beta of Halo Infinite on the gaming public.
We discuss our time with the multiplayer beta on this week&#x27;s Game Informer Show, but that&#x27;s not all! Halo Infinite is gracing the current cover of Game Informer, where we have pages upon pages of information about the game. It&#x27;s technically also the first place Halo Infinite went gold. Game Informer Gold, that is. Check out that incredible ultra-rare print variant here. Also, check out the trifecta of New Gameplay Today videos released today, showing off that now-golden campaign.</span>

                    <span>Double Fine Productions, the developer behind the Psychonauts series, Broken Age, and many more, recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate this milestone, Double Fine partnered with Indie By Design to release a comprehensive art book that details the visual history of every single game the developer has released over the years – including insights from developers, in-depth interviews, and never-before-seen concept art. 
Read down below for an exclusive excerpt from the book, titled 20 Double Fine Years, giving a brief look at the design decisions behind Psychonauts 2&#x27;s Aquato family and the game&#x27;s many, many brains.

                    <span>A week after Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, the company is returning the original versions of those games to PC.
The PC versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were removed from digital storefronts in preparation for the remastered editions. However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.
In an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, &quot;The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.&quot; Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, &quot;We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost.&quot;
While this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there&#x27;s no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it&#x27;s committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, &quot;We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward,&quot; and, &quot;A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues.&quot;
Last week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes. Especially the sheets of nightmarish rain plaguing Grand Theft Auto III.</span>

Originally released in 2006, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl ushered in a new generation of Pokémon games onto the Nintendo DS. With the themes of evolution and creation woven throughout the story, the upgraded designs of the new Pokémon found throughout the Sinnoh region, as well as newly discovered evolutionary lines of fan-favorite monsters, these games felt like a notable step forward for the franchise. In remaking these classics new Pokémon developer ILCA proves it can handle recreating the crucial tenants of the franchise.

                    <span>Star Citizen, the ever-in-development interstellar flight sim about piloting impressive spaceships you can buy with your real hard-earned money, is holding the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo 2951 (IAE 2951) from today until December 1. 
Typically, to get yourself behind the yoke of a space cruiser in Star Citizen, you&#x27;d have to cough up at least $45 for access to one of the game&#x27;s more basic ships. However, like a real-life car show (or a trip to almost any vehicle dealership), IAE 2951 will let intrepid pilots test out over 120 different flyable ships from various fictional manufacturers. Each day of the event will shift focus to specific ship companies and their wares.

While not the first Museum style collection (it&#x27;s a follow-up to 2014&#x27;s Pac-Man Museum), this newest iteration includes popular modern titles such as Pac-Man Championship Edition and Pac-Man 256 and oddities like the Wii-exclusive Pac-Motos. The full list of titles is as follows:
Pac-Man
Super Pac-Man
Pac &amp; Pal
Pac-Land
Pac-Mania
Pac-Attack
Pac-In-Time
Pac-Man Arrangement (Arcade Version)
Pac-Man Arrangement (Console Version)
Pac-Man Championship Edition
Pac-Motos
Pac ‘N Roll Remix
Pac-Man Battle Royale
Pac-Man 256
To access each game, you’ll explore an actual arcade as Pac-Man himself, which is pretty meta. This arcade can be customized to your liking Animal Crossing-style by purchasing decor using coins earned by completing in-game missions. 
Pac-Man Museum + gobbles its way to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in early 2022.</span>

Battlefield has always been the largest and loudest multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the video game equivalent of Texas, and its bombast cannot be overstated. Battlefield 2042 offers a variety of ways to participate in simulated near-future warfare. Whether you prefer to fight via land or sky, you can experience dizzying on-screen explosions, tense firefights, and more vehicles than teammates who know how to drive them. Unfortunately, Battlefield 2042 is full of almost as many bugs as bad pilots, dragging down an otherwise solid online shooter.
If nothing else, Battlefield 2042 is fami…</span>

Spartans! Bare your fangs! Set a fire in your heart! Halo Infinite’s December 8 release draws nearer with each passing day...but it’s not time to finish the fight just yet. It’s not an easy wait, but hopefully, what Game Informer has in store for you today makes it a little easier. 
Today, Game Informer has three videos for you from the first hours of Halo Infinite, and your hosts Alex Stadnik and Wesley LeBlanc will be your guides, explaining what they thought of each as they played it, how they tackled each objective, and more.

                    <span>Mii Masters.

The Wii is 15 years old, words to make this writer feel a little bit old. It was an era when HD was a bold new frontier in gaming, and Nintendo decided &#x27;nah, we&#x27;ll just do something fun instead&#x27;. It&#x27;s extraordinary to consider that the Wii and DS shared the market, creating a boom for Nintendo that even the current Switch success can&#x27;t emulate - two systems, both leading the field and reshaping the definition of &#x27;gamer&#x27;.

                    <span>Pencil in the date.
For those that are filling a room (and then probably another room) with lots of limited edition and collectable Switch physical releases, there&#x27;s now news on release #60 from Super Rare Games - it&#x27;s Mundaun which was developed by Hidden Fields.
This is a first-person adventure / horror title with an interesting hand-drawn pencil art style and a muted colour palette; we gave it plenty of praise in our Mundaun review. It&#x27;ll go on sale on 25th November on the official website with a 4000 copy limit, and as usual there&#x27;ll be a &quot;full-colour manual, interior artwork, an exclusive sticker, and trading cards&quot;.

                    <span>Swiitch ports.
It&#x27;s now 15 years since Wii launched and the world was introduced to the inclusive delights of Wii Sports, waggle gaming, and Wii elbow. That little three-DVD-case-sized box of tricks delivered some real gems over its long life — many of which were tailor-made for the system&#x27;s innovative remote-style motion controller and nunchuk and wouldn&#x27;t work the same on any other platform.
Well, that&#x27;s not quite true, is it? The Joy-Con controllers that slide onto the side of your Nintendo Switch feature all the gyroscopic motion-sensing gubbins needed to control any Wii game in a most authentic manner. In fact, we&#x27;ve seen a whole bunch of previously Wii-exclusive games on Switch already, including all-time classics like Super Mario Galaxy, Xenoblade Chronicles, and World of Goo, the first two games in the No More Heroes series, the HD port of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, and the sublime Okami HD (okay, we&#x27;re cheating with that one as it debuted on PS2, but the Wii port was a fine one).

                    <span>&quot;The games will reach the level of quality that they deserve to be&quot;.
Rockstar is a company that, for the most part, has enjoyed near constant success and extraordinary sales. As you&#x27;re no doubt aware, though, the recent launch of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition was met with plenty of criticism, which will have no doubt been bruising for Rockstar and the development team at Grove Street Games.
Rockstar has now published a &#x27;note from the Rockstar Games team&#x27; addressing the criticism and apologising for the project&#x27;s issues. It suggests there&#x27;ll be a roadmap of multiple updates to bring the games up to a higher level of quality, with the first expected in the coming days for &#x27;all versions&#x27; of the game.

                    <span>Wolf Link is going grey.
The Wii is 15 years old this week. That&#x27;s not too bad, right? It feels like it came out around a decade and a half ago, right? For context, here are some other things that happened in 2006: The first Cars movie, the first Daniel Craig Bond movie, Casino Royale, and we met Dr Kawashima in the very first Brain Training game.
But with this news comes some slightly more distressing news: Twilight Princess is now also 15 years old, which, fun fact, makes it older than A Link To The Past was when Twilight Princess came out. Let&#x27;s do the maths together:

If you blend point and click puzzling with asynchronous multiplayer, the result could be the rather intriguing upcoming release The Past Within. Rather like the multi-screen approach you see in something like The Jackbox Party Pack, players team up across devices to work together and tackle puzzles with their own viewpoints.
Due in Q2 2022 it&#x27;s the work of Rusty Lake, a Dutch studio that has produced a series of point and click experiences on other platforms. The Past Within is their most ambitious project, and as you can see in the trailer it&#x27;ll be coming to Switch as well, though like in the trailer hopefully you&#x27;ll be able to team up and play with those on other platforms as well.

If running about and getting hit with real-life Nerf pellets sounds a bit too exhausting, you might want to check out Nerf Legends, a new first-person shooter that lets you shoot things to your heart&#x27;s content while staying firmly seated on your sofa. Something that should be a selling point of any video game, let&#x27;s be honest.
The game will have you taking on a variety of blaster-wielding opponents as you shoot your way through combat arenas, pulling off trick shots as you go. There&#x27;s a single-player story mode to work through, but you can also jump online to compete with others if you prefer. Here&#x27;s a feature list to tell you more:

Unreal Life, a point-and-click adventure game from Japanese developer hako life, is making the leap to the European eShop on 3rd December, it&#x27;s been confirmed.
The game, which launched in Japan and the US a year ago today, is finally heading to Europe thanks to Selecta Play; the company has helped to get English, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese localisations ready for release, allowing plenty of new players to check it out for the first time.

                    <span>Pitch please.
There isn’t exactly an abundance of rhythm games available on the Switch (certainly not recently), so it goes without saying that Klang 2 sticks out a bit from the pack simply by catering to this oft-overlooked genre. We’re not sure why Tinimations decided to bring Klang 2 over to the Switch before its predecessor, but from what we’ve seen this entry is the stronger of the two. Klang 2 isn’t perfect and it’s rather short, but it successfully offers up an enjoyable rhythm action experience that genre fans will want to know about.
Klang 2 technically has a story, although it’s hardly anything that feels particularly worth experiencing. From what we can tell you’re playing in the role of an amnesiac “rave warrior” named Sonus, who’s being haunted by ghosts that are somehow related to his mystical tuning fork-like Tuneblade. A mysterious magical eye being named “A-Eye” thus decides to help him be rid of the ghosts forever, but only if he pledges his undying allegiance to the eye after he’s done.

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on Switch take players back to the Sinnoh region first seen on Nintendo DS in 2006. This region will also be the setting for the upcoming prequel adventure Pokémon Legends: Arceus, so these Generation 4 remakes are a great introduction to the Sinnoh Pokédex for new players.
If you&#x27;ve got any questions about how to catch certain Pokémon, or you&#x27;re having trouble knowing what to do next in the game, or perhaps need help to win a particularly challenging Pokémon battle, you should check out our Pokémon Diamond and Pearl guides below.

Fans have been waiting years and years for Pokémon&#x27;s fourth-generation remakes and the day is finally here. Yes, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are available right now on Nintendo Switch.
A reimagining of the adventure found within the original Diamond and Pearl on Nintendo DS, the new games take fans back to the Sinnoh region for one last hoorah – well, until Pokémon Legends: Arceus comes along at least. The launch trailer for the new titles has now been released, so make sure to check it out above.

                    <span>Imposter!
The Switch is likely to be one of Christmas 2021&#x27;s most desirable items, which means we could see it selling out everywhere – despite the fact that it&#x27;s approaching its fifth birthday.
When there&#x27;s high demand for something, it usually means that other companies try to cash in, and that&#x27;s certainly true in the burgeoning Chinese-made gaming handheld sector. We&#x27;ve covered these emulation systems a few times on Nintendo Life, with products like the Anbernic R351V and Retroid Pocket 2 providing to be solid (and cheap) means of playing ROMs, but companies in the Far East seem to have struck upon an ingenious way of making their devices even more appealing to potential (and perhaps unsuspecting) customers: they&#x27;re making them look like the Switch.

                    <span>Never stop fighting &#x27;til the fight is done.
Empire of Sin had a lot of attention when it launched last year, with major publisher Paradox and developer Romero Games giving cause for optimism. The 1920s gangster-era tactics game disappointed in various respects, unfortunately, with our tagline of &#x27;Eliot Mess&#x27; giving you a good idea of what we thought of the Switch version in our review.
There have been updates and fixes since, of course, but evidently it&#x27;s an ongoing project to find the right balance for the game&#x27;s various systems. This week it&#x27;s had a major patch with numerous fixes and some additions - called the &#x27;Free Precinct Update&#x27; - along with its first major paid expansion, &#x27;Make It Count&#x27;. The expansion adds new characters and units, along with 20 new missions; it can be bought on its own or as part of the Expansion Pass.

                    <span>Does expensive merch get any better than this?
When it comes to Pokémon merch, nowhere has it as good as Japan. In the past we&#x27;ve seen a huge Snorlax plush that doubles up as a bed, a fantastic human-sized Metapod cocoon that&#x27;s perfect for jumping inside and being sad, and now we have a life-size Lucario that can apparently help you do the washing up. It&#x27;s just not fair.
The Lucario, which measures exactly 1.2m tall (its exact measurement in the official Pokédex), is currently up for pre-order on Pokémon&#x27;s official Japanese store. They&#x27;re being made to order for a limited time, but you can only have them shipped to a Japanese address – if you&#x27;re lucky enough to live in Japan, you can order one now for 46,200 yen (roughly $405 / £302). That&#x27;s... pricey, but not as expensive as it could have been?

                    <span>&quot;Flat GoldenEye boxes could be the next form of currency&quot;.
There&#x27;s been a lot of drama surrounding graded retro game sales recently, with many people claiming the whole thing is an elaborate scam. However, it would seem that despite the current cloud of negativity, there&#x27;s still room for new trends to develop – but we didn&#x27;t think that selling empty, flat-packed boxes would be one of them.
That&#x27;s right – there&#x27;s currently a listing on eBay for two GoldenEye display boxes – first print (1997) and Player&#x27;s Choice (1999) – with a combined price tag of £2,445 ($3,281 USD). &quot;I&#x27;m reluctant to split up the pair but feel free to contact  with any questions or to discuss a price,&quot; says the seller.

While Nintendo of America has been leaning into celebrity appearances in recent commercials promoting the Switch, in Japan the focus is a bit less glitzy. Like in previous years adverts for the Japanese market are emphasizing multiplayer fun with family and friends, with quite charming results.
Featured games include the likes of Ring Fit Adventure, Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics, Mario Party Superstars, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain. There are parents and grandparents playing with kids, and of course friends bantering and playing online.

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

                    <span>Chums, I have a confession to make. For someone writing about Black Friday PC hardware deals, I don’t know all that much about PC hardware. Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.

                    <span>The holiday season, heralded by Black Friday, is often a time for reminiscing about the past. For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

                    <span>While New World seems mostly to be occupied in a war against exploits like duping, forever firing off fixes or disabling features, this week brings an update focused on adding newness. That&#x27;s nice. The &#x27;Into The Void&#x27; update introduces the magical new Void Gauntlet, a weapon which can be used to heal or harm. You can perform violence upon new enemies too, because various Varangian forces have arrived to plunder the island.

                    <span>There&#x27;s no time to explain: the Intel Core i5-12600K has a Black Friday deal. I mean that&#x27;s weird, right? It only came out scant weeks ago and it&#x27;s already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

                    <span>Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour &#x27;n&#x27; puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

                    <span>For all the loathsome talk of the metaverse from companies like Facebook and Epic as the future of reality, many facets of the concept already exist in sandboxes like Roblox. The problem with Roblox for them is that it&#x27;s a lawless frontier town, one they don&#x27;t control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it&#x27;s popular with brands who don&#x27;t need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

                    <span>I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

                    <span>Arkane&#x27;s sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said &quot;stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight&quot;. Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game&#x27;s second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

                    <span>As the nights grow colder and we seek the warm, sweaty embrace of a VR headset to while away our evenings with, HTC have kicked off their Black Friday deals early this year with a whole week of deals on their various Vive headsets. There are savings of up to £250 to be had here across all of their Vive headsets, including the full Vive Cosmos and Cosmos Elite kits, and their eye-tracking Vive Pro Eye.

                    <span>Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It&#x27;s a beta, they insist. But we all know it&#x27;s the proper game because they&#x27;ve had their betas already (excuse me, &quot;flights&quot;). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

                    <span>During Battlefield 2042&#x27;s week of early access for people who paid extra, players were more forgiving of bugs and wonk with the expectation that it would be fixed by a launch patch. Well, the game is out today, the launch patch has hit, and the game is still in a bit of a state. 78% of the 5500-odd player reviews on Steam are negative right now, with many complaining about crashes, poor performance, and more. Dice have said they plan to launch two patches in the next month.

                    <span>Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

                    <span>Thymesia is an upcoming action-adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the world&#x27;s toughest plague doctor who uses diseases-turned-weapons to battle enemies. The fast-paced action RPG sports heavy Dark Souls vibes and was slated to launch on December 7. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case because Thymesia is now arriving sometime in 2022.
Developer OverBorder Studio states it wants to make sure Thymesia is razor-sharp for its big debut, so it&#x27;s leaving it in the oven for a while longer. On the bright side, it announced the game is headed to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S after only confirming PC in the past.
Thymesia stars Corvus, a plague doctor who’s half-man, half-raven. He’s on a mission to regain his lost memories while also slaying abominations lurking within his gloomy kingdom. Combat is fast-paced and punishing, emphasizing aggression and mobility thanks to a swift dodge maneuver. Corvus can extract diseases from foes, then transform them into weapons such as a scythe or sword. He can also utilize his raven form to unleash dagger-like feathers. You can mold Corvus to your liking thanks to multiple character builds, as well as different endings to encourage replayability. Check out the original announcement trailer below.

                    <span>Following Sony Interactive Entertainment’s purchase of Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as EVO, Smash Bros. fans were left wondering what could come of the usual Smash Bros. tournaments featured at the annual EVO showcases. The global COVID-19 pandemic threw its own wrench in EVO’s in-person showcases, but it seems Nintendo is ready to officially support the Smash tournament scene. 
“Confirmed. Ready your A-game, Super Smash Bros competitors. We’ve partnered with Panda Global to launch the first officially licenses Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America, coming 2022.” 



Confirmed. Ready your A-game, Super #SmashBros competitors. We&#x27;ve partnered with @PandaGlobal to launch the first officially licensed Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America, coming 2022! #SmashBrosUltimate #SmashBrosMelee https://t.co/3WKbEYrMH2
November 18, 2021
As you can see in the tweet above, Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global to bring “the first officially licensed circuit for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Smash Bros. Melee to North America.” This is especially unprecedented as Nintendo has often remained quite mum on support for the Melee tournament scene. 
It’s unclear exactly what these tournaments will look like – we’ll find out next year – but Panda says they’ll feature cash prizes. 
While waiting for more information, read about Sony’s purchase of EVO and then check out this story about the final fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Masahiro Sakurai’s journey to get Sora added to the game after that.

                    <span>Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

At the time of this update, over 500 workers have put their names on the petition, which reads, &quot;We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard.&quot; The group&#x27;s demand is succinct and simple, saying, &quot;We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.&quot; According to data from 2020, Activision Bliz…</span>

After it was delayed to 2022, we learned that its release date was February 22. Now, Sifu will launch on February 8 in a rare move that sees it coming earlier than expected. To accompany the news, Sloclap has released a new trailer showcasing more of the bone-breaking combat featured in Sifu, which you can watch below:

While still technically in beta, players have criticized the Battle Pass progression featured within Halo Infinite’s multiplayer. More specifically, players have lamented how leveling up works. Right now, you only earn experience by completing specific weekly and daily challenges. These aren’t necessarily difficult to complete, but if you play a match without completing one, you essentially get nothing for the time spent in that match.

                    <span>Tencent has acquired a minority stake in Playtonic, the developer behind Yooka-Laylee and its 2D sequel, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. 
This news comes by way of Playtonic, which announced the news in a blog post made today. The studio says it will retain “full creative control over its IP” and will use Tencent’s investment funding to scale from its current structure to a bigger one.

“Playtonic...will use the investment to scale from their current one team structure to multiple teams, with an emphasis on hiring diverse talent from near and afar, improving their HQ, as well as looking to expand in new locations,” Playtonic’s blog post reads. 
Playtonic founder Gavin Price says Tencent’s investment will help the studio scale-up and fast-track the “super-exciting, super-secret projects we’ve been keeping close to our treasure chests.” The expansion of the studio has already begun, too, with Playtonic hiring Danny Spiteri, formerly of Raw Fury and Team 17, as its new Head of Publishing.

Ahead of the release of Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City next week, we have an exclusive new featurette that briefly dives into the relationship between the movie&#x27;s production team and the video game series&#x27; development team at Capcom. Check it out in full above. 
One fun tidbit detailed in the trailer is director Johannes Roberts sneaking in nods to his favorite games in the series: 
&quot;Director Johannes [Roberts] really loves the games, so there are a lot of Easter eggs in the movie,&quot; Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi says in the video. &quot;One of my personal favorites is, though the movie is based on games 1 and 2, director Johannes snuck in some of his favorite elements from a later game. Hope you can find it.&quot; 
For more on Welcome To Raccoon City, check our interview with two of the film&#x27;s leads, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, where we talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters. 
Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters on November 24, 2021.</span>

Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters next week on November 24. It&#x27;s perhaps one of the more interesting video game movies ever released. Not narratively or stylistically, but rather in the shoes it has to fill. Welcome To Raccoon City is a complete reimagining of the Resident Evil world for the big screen, coming off the heels of Paul W.S. Anderson&#x27;s Resident Evil film series, which ran for six movies, netting more than a billion dollars in box office revenue. 
Where Anderson took the Resident Evil source material and made his own science fiction universe, Welcome To Raccoon City – directed by Johannes Roberts (47 Meters Down, The Strangers: Prey At Night) – sticks far closer to the first two games in the series. It results in a far more grounded story, focusing on characters fans have known for decades. 
Ahead of the movie&#x27;s release next week, we sat down with two of its stars, Tom Hopper and Avan Jogia, who play Albert Wesker and Leon Kennedy, respectively, to talk about co-leading this new Resident Evil film series, their favorite moments from filming, and where they found inspiration for their characters. 
Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City will be released in theaters on November 24, 2021.</span>

                    <span>Loop Hero ranks among the year’s best PC exclusives, and we found out it was making its move to consoles, namely Switch, during August’s Nintendo Indie World Showcase. If you’ve been waiting to try your hand at the looping adventure or simply want to take it on the go, December 9 is the date to look out for.
For those unfamiliar with Loop Hero, it has a unique premise. To save the world from destruction, a hero roams a looping track filled with monsters and other hazards. However, you don’t control your hero directly; instead, you create the world in which he’ll explore. By strategically placing a variety of creatures, terrain types, and obstacles, your auto-moving hero grows stronger with every baddie slain. The key is to throw just enough at the hero to increase its strength without accidentally overwhelming them and causing their demise. In between runs, you&#x27;ll build up a settlement with different shops to unlock equipment and buffs to increase your odds for the next loop.

Loop Hero is one of those titles best played yourself to truly understand its hooks. In our review of the PC version, we scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Tack noted that “Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.”
Loop Hero is priced at $14.99 but you can pre-order it on the eShop now for a 10% discount ($13.49).</span>

Developer: Visual Concepts
		

WWE fans know that the company has been in a chaotic state as of late. Dozens of roster cuts this year have not only put fans on edge about the long-term fates of their favorite Superstars, but they&#x27;ve also brought into question the status of WWE 2K22. It&#x27;s the first wrestling sim since 2019&#x27;s ill-received 2K20, and the game is forgoing the series&#x27; usual fall release window for a March 2022 launch. That extra time seemingly gives Visual Concepts time to polish up a few holds, so what can fans expect? While Visual Concepts is still withholding most information until its previously announced January unveiling, it did provide a sneak peek into the features and improvements its concocted so far.

                    <span>Victura and Highwire Games have announced that Six Days in Fallujah, a controversial shooter based on the real-life Battle of Fallujah that occurred during the Iraq War, has been delayed to 2022. 
More specifically, the shooter has been delayed to Q4 of 2022, citing that the team behind it needs more people to hit the level of quality the studio is striving for. It also requires more capital and time, hence the delay. 
“It became clear that recreating these true stories at a high quality was going to require more people, capital, and time than we had,” Victura CEO Peter Tamte said in the delay announcement. “Doubling our team is just one of the many things we’re doing to make sure Six Days in Fallujah brings new kinds of tactical and emotional depth to military shooters.” 
Atomic Games attempted to release a game set during the Battle of Fallujah way back in 2009. However, the project was rightfully criticized for the developer’s decision to alongside the CIA to publish the game, with many calling it propaganda. Ultimately, Atomic Games’ project was re-revealed back in February with news that Victura and Highwire Games were helming the Fallujah-centric game instead. 
The studio said around the announcement that the team had spent over three years building unique technology to overhaul the game and its mechanics. It also revealed that it hopes to go beyond simply presenting another shooter and instead show the realities of war and its consequences. However, the re-reveal was criticized much in the same way the first attempt at this game was. 
Only time will tell what the final product turns out to be, but now we know it’s not coming until at least Q4 of next year. 
While waiting for that, check out Game Informer’s coverage of the original 2009 reveal and then read about the Six Days in Fallujah revival after that.</span>

                    <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced MultiVersus, a free-to-play platform fighter game featuring team-based 2v2 combat between famous characters like Batman, Bugs Bunny, and more. 
Perhaps one of the year’s worst-kept secrets, MultiVersus had been heavily rumored as of late, with apparent leaks appearing on social media and elsewhere. However, today’s announcement makes it official: you’ll finally be able to destroy Batman by throwing Jerry at him while playing as Tom (dreams really do come true).

                    <span>Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi title, Pragmata, has been delayed to 2023. 
Pragmata was first announced during the PlayStation 5 reveal event way back in June 2020. It featured an astronaut walking through New York who stumbles upon a little girl. A strange glitch-in-the-matrix happens and all of a sudden, a satellite crashes through the sky and then the duo ends up in space after using some weird 3D printer-like device. It’s as strange as it sounds, as you can see from the Pragmata announcement trailer. 
However, when it was first revealed, Capcom said the game would release in 2022. Now, it’s been delayed to 2023, which isn’t all that surprising considering that 2020 look at the title was the last we heard about Pragmata. 
An update on #PRAGMATA:

As you can see in the tweet above, Capcom released a new video alongside news of this delay. It features Pragmata’s young heroine holding a piece of paper with “2022” scratched out and “2023” written beside it. The company also released new artwork, which you can see below:

                    <span>Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit has received a new 2.0 update, and it brings split-screen multiplayer, a new four-player Relay Race mode, additional tracks, and more customization to the racer. 
This update was revealed on Nintendo’s YouTube yesterday in a new video showcasing all you can expect in 2.0. In it, Nintendo reveals the new split-screen multiplayer mode coming to Mario Kart Live, which is the company’s toys-to-life-esque kart racer that tasks players with building a track in their own house and then racing a real Mario Kart RC car around it.

The new Split-Screen mode is exactly what you’d expect in a Mario Kart game: place two karts onto the track, round up two controllers, and race your friend or foe on-screen. It looks pretty identical to a standard Mario Kart split-screen mode, except it’s your living room on the screen rather than Bowser’s Castle. 
If two players aren’t enough, you can bring in two more thanks to Mario Kart Live’s new Relay Race mode. In this mode, two players will be on one kart, and they can swap control of the wheel back and forth, meaning up to four people can play at once. Three new courses have been added: Windmill Meadows, Music Broadway, and King Boo’s Courtyard. Plus, Luigi’s Poltergust is now a customization item available for use alongside the Spooky Horn. You must complete the Luigi Cup under certain conditions in the Grand Prix to unlock them, though.
If you haven’t yet checked out Mario Kart Live, be sure to read Game Informer’s Mario Kart Live review and then check out this New Gameplay Today featuring some Game Informer editors playing Mario Kart Live.

For many of us, me included, that means stuffing our faces with delicious treats like we’re in training for Fat Bear Week. What&#x27;s your favourite? Mine&#x27;s the 
lebkuchen hearts with apricot filling, plus anything with marzipan.
The point I’m trying to get to is that this isn’t really a slim and sexy time of year for me. More of a fat and cuddly (but still sexy) season. On the other hand, this Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is both slim and sexy, as well as a full $500 off in Dell&#x27;s early Black Friday sales.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I came down on the side of basically liking Age Of Empires 4. Lukewarm praise, perhaps, but it seems to be doing well, and that makes me glad. We&#x27;ve needed an RTS revival for ages, right? And this one is good, if a bit safe.
For the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?

They say the company need a new CEO &quot;with the expertise, skill set and conviction to truly change the company&#x27;s culture&quot;.

                    <span>At long last, we have a date for Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update. On November 30th, Mojang will give the game&#x27;s mountains and caves a makeover, adding new sub-biomes and letting folks explore deeper than before. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to the new Lush Cave biomes, which are gonna be full of vines, moss and pretty blossoms. I reckon that would make a lovely location for an underground home.

                    <span>Warner Bros. today announced a Smash Bros-style platformer fighter of their own, throwing characters from across their many series and franchises into one big rumble. In MultiVersus, you can expect to see Shaggy from Scooby Doo teaming up with Steven Universe to battle actual killers like Harley Quinn and Arya Stark, and more. It&#x27;s due to launch in 2022, and will be free-to-play. Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I can&#x27;t remember why I picked this theme, but for this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast I wanted to talk about AI characters - as in, characters that are, in game, an artificial intelligence of some kind. This definition does cause some trouble. After all, is not every character in a game that isn&#x27;t player controlled an AI character, fn fn fn?
No, because you all know what I mean and so does Nate. Matthew doesn&#x27;t, know, and had prepared a list of just, companion characters. Don&#x27;t worry, he actually pulls out some really good examples. We talk about a lot of games this week, not least because I didn&#x27;t prepare a Cavern Of Lies again. Sorry. There is also a lot of talk about clones, and what Matthew would do with clones of himself (e.g. shove them out of an airlock).

                    <span>Supercars are boring. That one on Forza Horizon 5’s front cover? Don’t care how fast it goes, mate. Oh, goes from 1 to 60 in 2.7 seconds does it? Yeah, well, that&#x27;s how long it takes to prepare this knuckle sandwich. No, but seriously, they’re all the same to me: just wedges of carbon fibre with wheels. I’m sure the engineering is marvelous and the innovation groundbreaking. But let’s be honest, in videogames they’re virtually all the same.
My Forza Horizon 5 fantasy doesn’t involve Lamborghinis or Ferraris. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of opulence. Mexico’s roads are for me and my mundane companions. The Volvo Estate, the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic. The everyday vehicles that make up for their lack of speed with heaps of character. I just wish there were more to choose from.

                    <span>Undungeon is a peculiar action RPG set at the end of the universe, in which you play an immortal herald called Void who has been pieced together by God themselves using a primordial stew of hot organs, conscious essence and wet rib cages. Something very complicated has happened to reality, and you’re here to fix it with your swooshing Freddy Kreuger claws and clever dialogue choices. 


I’m still not entirely sure what Undungeon is about. The characters, a cast of hovering orbs, corrupted flesh angels and crystal beings, repeatedly try to explain what’s going on, but it never quite sinks in. Collapsing dimensions are causing no end of trouble, that’s pretty clear, shattering into an infinite number of spinning shards that rain like an exotic meteor shower over a scorched wasteland inhabited by nomadic technomancers and acid-spitting scorpions. You’re sent down to the dusty mortal plane to plug everything back in again and reset the multiverse, like an interdimensional BT engineer.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been struggling with crashes or online stability in Forza Horizon 5, it&#x27;s probably worth updating your game. Last night, Playground Games released a patch for the new open-world race &#x27;em up, fixing a number of crashes that can occur when upgrading cars or spawning traffic, and improving stability for Horizon Life (the game&#x27;s online component). This hotfix was supposed to arrive last week, but better late than never.

Our very own Ed Thorn played for four hours, only to reach battle pass level 3 the other night. Thankfully, the developers have already detailed a handful of changes coming this week that should improve things - from adding new, easier challenges, to removing some of the rubbish weeklies players don&#x27;t like.

It&#x27;s not just its excellent ocean that I want to enjoy without pointless random murder. It&#x27;s the sailing. The thrill of moving around and operating this vehicle, hearing it creak as you turn a wheel, and whoosh as you catch the wind.
Sailwind is all about that. You sail a boat. Nobody will attack you. There are no monsters to fight, or guilds to appease. It&#x27;s just you, the sea, and the skills that will take your boat across it well enough that you don&#x27;t starve on the way.

It&#x27;s a demo Halo fans will never forget. In 2020, developer 343 Industries brought its latest take on the Halo franchise to the masses during one of Microsoft&#x27;s digital events. Halo Infinite&#x27;s gameplay debut was met with some positivity but spawned an online firestorm and popularized conversation around Craig The Brute, among other discussions. It&#x27;s been over a year since fans were shown that demo, and a lot has changed ahead of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign release on December 8. Before that long-awaited day, join us for a unique updated look at the campaign in all its new shining glory.
Today&#x27;s video isn&#x27;t a complete one-to-one recreation of the 2020 footage, but rather a potent illustration of how the team has improved upon that earlier foundation, including …</span>

                    <span>Update, 11/17/21:
The physical deluxe edition of Kena: Bridge of Spirits will be out this Friday. 
Detailed today in a new press release from Kena dev Ember Lab and Maximum Games, this deluxe edition of the PlayStation-exclusive game will cost $49.99. It will include a digital soundtrack, a retail exclusive physical sticker sheet, a unique digital in-game silver staff for Kena to use, a golden Rot character skin, and “unique celebration hats for the Rot.” 
Maximum Games says the deluxe edition will be sold in “popular retailers” and can be purchased directly from its website. The game will continue to be sold as a standard digital edition release for $39.99 and a digital deluxe edition for $49.99 on PSN, too.

                    <span>Released on the Nintendo DS in 2006 in Japan and 2007 everywhere else, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl started the fourth generation of games, with the third entry, Platinum, coming three years later. This introduction to the region of Sinnoh ushered in a whopping 107 new monsters for trainers to collect, befriend, and battle. 
With the Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl remakes releasing this week (here&#x27;s our review), we thought it would be fun to do a casual ranking of the top 25 Pokémon introduced in the fourth generation games.
Here are a few things to keep in mind while perusing this list: 
These rankings are based on factors ranging from power to popularity, rarity, memorability, or just because I happen to think they are neat.
Your favorites may differ, and that&#x27;s more than okay.

                    <span>343 community director Brian Jarrard took to Twitter yesterday to address something that&#x27;s getting a lot of chatter as players begin to jump into the free-to-play Halo Infinite multiplayer experience. The topic might surprise you, as it&#x27;s not about any weapon being overpowered or a map being weak but rather something else entirely. So what is all the discourse about? The battle pass, of course!
Thank you to everyone who has jumped into the #HaloInfintie beta so far! FYI the team is looking at Battle Pass progression and gathering data from yesterday&#x27;s sessions and we&#x27;ll share updates as we have them. Please continue to share feedback and raise flags as you see them. 1/3

                    <span>Eidos Montreal dropped an update for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy today that makes the space-faring comic book adventure look and run even better. 
On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game now features ray-tracing, meaning the lighting is more realistic than ever. You can activate the feature in the Video Settings menu.
On Xbox Series S, players have the option to uncap the framerate to run between 30 and 60 frames-per-second. Eidos recommends this feature to users with a VRR (variable refresh rate) display and warns that some framerates may be unstable in certain areas. 
Meanwhile, base PlayStation 4 players can enjoy an overall performance boost. Eidos even tweaked the sensitivity for the visor to register inputs from older, more worn-down controllers. 
The patch also adds the following improvement across all versions of the game:
Save Rollback: A hidden Save Rollback feature was added to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice
General stability improvement on all platforms
Multiple stability improvements with Ray Tracing enabled
General improvements to objective markers
Additional improvements to world boundaries
PC players can expect the patch as early as Friday, November 19. Furthermore, Eidos has also squashed several bugs, the full list of which you can view on the developer&#x27;s Reddit post. 
For more on Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, be sure to check out our full review of the game here. The title is nominated in a few categories for The Game Awards 2021.</span>

                    <span>Newcomer Luke will be the focus of Street Fighter V&#x27;s Fall Update next week, which is also being branded as the final event for the long-supported game.
In a tweet this morning on the Street Fighter Twitter account, the streaming event is set for Tuesday, November 23, and promises a gameplay showcase for Luke and a behind-the-scenes look at the character. In previous updates, Capcom has shown footage of mocap sessions, shared design insights, and music/merch collaborations, along with the gameplay breakdowns.

Luke was revealed in August to be the last addition of the Season 5 character pass and Street Fighter V as a whole, following a parade of returning favorites from Street Fighter and adjacent series Rival Schools. In the event where he was revealed, Street Fighter V&#x27;s developers described Luke as a glimpse at the future of the series. He&#x27;s dressed for a fight with MMA gear, including lightweight gloves and sponsor-laden trunks. His move set featured quick strikes and speedy, impactful projectiles, though we&#x27;ll have to see how this has changed in the time since the reveal. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll also get more hints at what to expect in an upcoming Street Fighter game.

                    <span>If you’ve ever wanted your palico or palamute in Monster Hunter Rise to look like Sonic and Tails, now’s your chance. 
That’s because Sonic and Tails are (kinda) coming to Monster Hunter Rise in a new collaboration that goes live on November 26. The official Monster Hunter Twitter account posted a one-minute video today featuring the groovy basslines you’ve come to expect from Sonic music alongside footage of palico Sonic and palamute Tails in-game. 
OH YEAH! @Sonic_Hedgehog collaboration coming in FAST!

Look, I’m not Sonic expert but I have to be honest: palico Sonic works so much better than palamute Tails. The palico actually looks like the blue dude who likes to go fast – you could convince me that’s just actually him. The palamute, however, looks like a dog that someone’s dressed up to be like Tails. I don’t know if any of this matters to players – it probably doesn’t – but if I’m going for the full gold rings experience, I’m rolling with Sonic. 
It’s cool regardless that both are in-game; it&#x27;s even cooler that the palico can seemingly turn into Super (Saiyan) Sonic too. 
As noted in the announcement video, this Monster Hunter Rise x Sonic The Hedgehog collaboration will go live on November 26. That day, an event quest will go live and it yields not just the palico and palamute armor pieces as rewards, but some Hunter armor as well. Complete this quest and your entire squad can roll out at the speed of sound in style. This collaboration will hit the PC version when it launches in January. 
While waiting for this collaboration to go live, check out Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then read where Monster Hunter Rise ended up on this year’s Game Awards nomination list. Read about how Monster Hunter Rise won’t have cross-save or crossplay with Switch when it hits PC this coming January.

                    <span>The studio behind the Yakuza series and the Judgment series, Ryu Ga Gotoku, is working on a new franchise, but it won’t be connected to either of their beloved crime-related series. 
This news comes from Video Games Chronicle, which reports that studio director Masayoshi Yokohama told Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that RGG is planning a new game separate from the Yakuza or Judgment series. 
“We’re also working on unannounced titled outside of [Yakuza and Judgment],” Yokoyama told Famitsu. 
If you’re worried about not getting more Yakuza as a result, though, don’t fret – RGG has already confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon is in the works, even though series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has departed from Sega. The future of the Judgment series, however, is not so guaranteed. As noted by VGC, after an alleged dispute between Sega and lead actor Takuya Kimura’s talent agency, it’s unclear if the series even has its leading actor to rely on for the role of Takayuki Yagami. 
Yokoyama said RGG “will continue to cherish the Judgment series” when talking to Famitsu, so that’s something. Only time will tell what comes of it, but now we know a new franchise is in the works at the studio.
While waiting to learn more about it, check out Game Informer’s Lost Judgment review and then read Game Informer’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon review. Check out this story about Yakuza series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi’s departure from Sega after that.

                    <span>Saints Row graced the cover of Game Informer magazine last month and looks to be a modern reboot of the GTA-inspired and wildly/hilariously inappropriate franchise from over a decade ago. And with Deep Silver Volition developing the title, the nostalgia factor is at an all-time high. Saints Row was originally slated for a February 25 release, but a new statement from Volition chief creative officer Jim Boone weaves a different, more deflating story. Sadly, the Saints Row reboot is being delayed to summer 2022.

Then, Hextech Mayhem is a cute-looking rhythm runner.

                    <span>If you haven’t heard, we&#x27;re in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

                    <span>There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

The Wall Street Journal even claim that Kotick himself had allegedly threatened to have someone killed. This is the second walkout workers have held this year following the first lawsuit that made allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment.

It&#x27;s the usual sensible reason: the pandemic has messed with anyone attempting to do anything, and they want more time to make it good. Please do!

                    <span>New World, Amazon Games&#x27; opening move into game dev, was not always an MMORPG. It used to be a survival horror game. According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. &quot;They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done,&quot; Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World&#x27;s development at this year&#x27;s Develop Conference in Brighton. &quot;They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out.&quot;
A survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it&#x27;s all down to Amazon&#x27;s first &#x27;Leadership Principle&#x27;: Customer Obsession.

                    <span>Na světě je nejnovější sestavení CentOS, odpovídající Red Hat Enterprise Linuxu 8.5. Číselně jde o subverzi 2111 a jde o poslední vydání před koncem klasického CentOS, jak jsme jej znali. Připomeňme, že CentOS 8 končí s 31. prosincem 2021, poté již CentOS bude fungovat na jiné bázi.</span>

                    <span>Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin has already graced us with several demos and a look at what&#x27;s to come ahead of its March 2022 release, and today Square has unveiled some more locations and characters from the world. As we have already seen, this action RPG that&#x27;s packed with elements from the Nioh titles also draws quite heavily from the world of Final Fantasy. Specifically, the world, music, characters, enemies, and more are all quite rooted in the original NES title. Of course, these aspects all look quite different today and have been massively altered to fit an action game, but you can absolutely see it.
Today, we get a look at a town and a character from early on in Final Fantasy, right before players obtain the boat and can begin enjoying ocean travel. In Final Fantasy, you…</span>

After announcing Rambo and Stranger Things would eventually become a part of Far Cry 6, Ubisoft added yet another license to the mix. This one has a great tie to antagonist Antón Castillo, who is brought to life by actor Giancarlo Esposito. Players can now download Breaking Bad-inspired bundles to bring Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants and trucks to the world.
Esposito won&#x27;t be in character as Breaking Bad&#x27;s Gus Fring, but his eateries will certainly remind you of him. You can also wear Heisenberg-themed gear to further blend the game and TV show universes.
No half-measures here! Hide in plain sight at Los Pollos Hermanos or channel your inner Heisenberg with these bundles inspired by the smash hit television series. pic.twitter.com/q8xctfNLce

This new content also ties into today&#x27;s new DLC, Vaas&#x27;s Insanity. Vaas&#x27; look and voice are from actor Michael Mando, who just happens to play Nacho Varga in Breaking Bad&#x27;s prequel series, Better Call Saul. Vaas is the villain from Far Cry 3, and this DLC gives you the chance to play as him and learn more about his backstory.
This DLC is the first part of a villain-focused season pass that retails for $40. The second and third acts give players control of Pagan Min from Far Cry 4 and Joeseph Seed from Far Cry 5.
The trailer above gives you a look at what you can expect from Vaas&#x27; return, which is supposedly designed like a roguelite.
Are you still playing Far Cry 6? Do you have any interest in the villain&#x27;s gameplay? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

                    <span>Update: 11/16/21 8:44 p.m Central: Bobby Kotick responded to The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s report by recording a video message sent to Activision Blizzard employees. He addresses the article by saying it &quot;paints an inaccurate and misleading view of our company, of me personally, and my leadership.&quot; 
&quot;I want to say is that anyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn’t really appreciate how important this is to me,&quot; says Kotick in the message. &quot;Creativity and inspiration thrives best in a safe, welcoming, respectful environment. There is no substitute for that. And staying true to our values, without exceptions, is the best way to retain our talent and to attract the new talent we need to achieve our great potential.

                    <span>Collaborations are everywhere! Naruto in Fortnite. Ed Sheeran in Pokémon Go. Anime in World of Warships. The world is more fun when these things collide, isn&#x27;t it? They&#x27;re everywhere!  Today, the Transformers come to Hi-Rez moba Smite. Smite has had a notable amount of crossover material over the years, everything from The Legend of Korra to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Today, the roster of brands gets bigger as the Autobots roll out into the land of the gods. As with other collaborations, the new skins layer over existing gods, so don&#x27;t expect to actually get a tailored Optimus Prime moveset or anything, though you will look quite stylish.
The skins you can acquire consist of Optimis Prime for Geb, Megatron for Ra (!), and Starscream for Jing Wei. Of the three, you definitely want the Megatron one, right? Ra is a lot of fun anyway, so doing him up as Megatron is sure to be a blast. You can check out a lot more at the trailer right here!

                    <span>Remember Rime? Tequila Works is back, and they&#x27;re working on a game set in the League of Legends universe! The tale of a boy and a yeti is coming in 2022 with Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. Lovable moments and snowball fights are sure to happen in this title, which is scheduled to land on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Playstation 5, Switch, and PC. You can learn a lot more about the game and even see it in action a bit in the trailer below!

In case you&#x27;re wondering who&#x27;s who, Nunu is the child, and he&#x27;s looking for his mom. Willump is the yeti and will help Nunu make his way through the frozen wastes and hopefully find his mom! Nunu also has a magic flute that can alter the environment in a number of ways. Or you can just make Willump dance, which is always nice. A mix of puzzling challenges and journeying through icy environs, the adventure is marked with story beats and relationship building as well, as Nunu and Willump form an unbreakable friendship. According to the developers, it&#x27;s a game about friendship, family, and joy. Hard to argue with that, really. We look forward to seeing just where this warm story in frigid lands takes us in 2022.

                    <span>Today, musical artist Ed Sheeran announced on Twitter that an upcoming collaboration is happening with Pokémon Go. In this day and age when Naruto is in Fortnite and celebrities are tied to all kinds of products via these projects, it&#x27;s actually not that surprising. 
Pokémon has had a deluge of crossovers and collaborative projects over its long lifetime, and seeing Ed Sheeran make the jump from Game of Thrones (and other media!) over to Pokémon is sure to be interesting. With Pokémon being one of the world&#x27;s most powerful entertainment brands, extending well outside of the gaming sphere into movies, merch, and much more, this partnership is hardly unusual. But how will it play out, exactly?

The exact nature of this collaboration is anyone&#x27;s guess, what do you think the artist has in store for the mobile Pokémon game? Are we going to spin magical Ed Sheeran Pokéstops or gyms? Who knows. Maybe we can click to get the new album while we play with our Bulbasaurs. What do you think the collaboration will look like? Perhaps Sheeran will actually become a canonical Pokémon. I mean, it&#x27;s not that far off in a world where we have Pokémon that are ya know, keychains. So, what do you think this is going to be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Riot calls it a “fast-paced rhythm runner,” and that phrase was personified in Hextech Mayhem’s explosive (literally) launch trailer that premiered during today’s Riot Forge Showcase with Nintendo Switch. You can watch the gameplay footage below.

Piltover, Valoran’s cultural center with a gorgeous steampunk aesthetic, serves as the primary backdrop for Hextech Mayhem. You star as Ziggs, a zany yordle (a spirit that takes the form of a mammal) with a deep love and appreciation for big bombs.

Players explore the lands of Runeterra, specifically Bilgewater and the Shadow Isles, as a handful of League of Legends favorites. Miss Fortune, Illaoi, Braum, Yasuo, Ahri, and Pyke are all playable characters. Of course, the title of the game refers to what’s assumed to be a powerful force in the game as well, the League of Legends character Viego. You can get a look at what to expect in the trailer below!

Several additional price points exist beyond the standard edition of the game. The digital deluxe edition comes with Ruined skins for characters and bonus items, while the physical Collector’s Edition comes with an art book, sketch, soundtrack, cloth map, notebook/pen, and a mug. You’re going to need coffee for all that grinding, right?  
Ruined King: A League of Legends Story release date was delayed last December with no timeframe, but it looks like that time is now!

                    <span>Dragon Ball games tend to fall into one of two genres: fighting and, occasionally, RPGs. Dragon Ball: The Breakers bucks that trend as a new 7v1 asymmetrical online multiplayer game set within the mythos of Dragon Ball Xenoverse. 
Players control a group of seven ordinary civilians caught within a temporal seam. This pocket dimension is overseen by a powerful figure called the Raider, who hails from a different timeline. To escape imprisonment, the seven captives must traverse the sprawling map, locate Bulma’s Super Time Machine, and blast back to their plane of existence.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 has been one of my most anticipated games of the year for, well, three years now. It all started in 2019 when I saw a beyond-impressive gameplay demo at E3. The game, then scheduled for a 2020 release, blew away my already-high expectations. I enjoyed the original Dying Light, but felt that with a little bit of iteration and polish, the series could evolve into something truly special. Those hopes were delivered upon during that E3 2019 demo, and Dying Light 2 skyrocketed up my list of the most anticipated games of 2020.
Sadly, in the early stages of last year, Techland announced a delay to 2021. Then, after announcing a December 2021 release date, the developer delayed the game one (hopefully) final time, with the title now scheduled to release on February 4, 2022. It&#x27;s been…</span>

The contenders for the Game Of The Year award include Deathloop, It Takes Two, Psychonauts 2 and Resident Evil Village. Deathloop leads the nominations with nine.

                    <span>A report by the Wall Street Journal has brought to light several new examples of alleged misconduct by Activision staff, including rape and sexual harassment. The report also highlights several instances where Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was reportedly aware of the allegations but did not inform the company&#x27;s board of directors and, in one instance, intervened to prevent an alleged harasser from being fired.

In response to the report, employee group A Better ABK have called for Kotick to be replaced as CEO and are organising a staff walkout.

                    <span>Though Halo started out on Macs then joined Microsoft, historically the series hasn&#x27;t had much of a presence on personal computers. At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that&#x27;s changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?

                    <span>Today, Bandai Namco announced Dragon Ball: The Breakers, which is perhaps the most baffling game to be revealed this year. It&#x27;s a 7v1 survival horror game where a group of players have to escape a &quot;raider&quot; using all sorts of weird and wonderful abilities. It&#x27;s like Dead By Daylight meets Prop Hunt. Truthfully, when I first watched the trailer I was convinced they&#x27;d just put Cell in Dead By Daylight. Like, why not?

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I&#x27;m a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It&#x27;s integral to the plot of the game and it&#x27;s revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it&#x27;s also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant to be a fun little &quot;Oh!&quot; moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock&#x27;s best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares&#x27; new detect &#x27;em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you&#x27;ve played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that&#x27;s long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

                    <span>When Microsoft bought Bethesda last year, it raised questions about which consoles their future games would end up on. It&#x27;s not a huge drama for us in PC land, Microsoft already offer most of their new stuff to us and the Xbox lot. But for PlayStation owners, the drama has arrived. Phil Spencer says he sees The Elder Scrolls 6 as a PC and Xbox exclusive, the same as Starfield.

                    <span>Dying Light 2, like its predecessor, knows that its setting is as much of a sell as its gameplay. The development team at Techland has moved on from Dying Light’s setting of Harran in a nuclear-powered ‘salt the earth’ parting blow, and has shifted focus to Villedor. You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas. It’s not just more of the same Dying Light.

                    <span>Windows has contributed two iconic images to the public consciousness: the default Windows XP wallpaper; and the blue screen of death. But they cut Bliss decades ago, and Windows 11 put the final nail in the coffin of Windows&#x27; pop culture relevancy by turning the blue screen of death into a black screen of death. A tragedy. Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

But fortunately, modders have stepped in, making improvements to the game&#x27;s rain, fixing typos, adding in lots of nice graphics options and more. One modder has even fixed the nut on the Tuff Nut Donuts sign, which, for some baffling reason, had been rounded out.

                    <span>Barry Hattrick has just signed a two-year contract with Stockport County FC. The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as &#x27;my dad after three pints&#x27;. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no &#x27;larking about&#x27;. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It&#x27;s been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football&#x27;s favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they&#x27;ve had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

                    <span>Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you&#x27;re left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you&#x27;re meant to proceed. It wouldn&#x27;t be much of a puzzle game if there weren&#x27;t a few moments like this, of course, but when you&#x27;re playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you&#x27;re really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion&#x27;s debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios&#x27; The Room series. It&#x27;s a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

                    <span>The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It&#x27;s a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season&#x27;s Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there&#x27;s yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, &quot;This is Frogwares&#x27; world and we&#x27;re all just living in it!&quot; and, &quot;What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;

                    <span>Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he&#x27;d also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don&#x27;t need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don&#x27;t technically need the telegraph machine either, as there&#x27;s an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn&#x27;t half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

It&#x27;s your typical kinda horror experience - a singleplayer romp making you solve puzzles and linger in horrible places while trying to avoid spooks. You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you&#x27;ll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn&#x27;t work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they&#x27;re currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year&#x27;s end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

Well, it&#x27;s back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.

Tyto instrukce se používají typicky v náročných vědeckých výpočtech (HPC) a pro (de)kódování videa.</span>

                    <span>Ze samotného faktu, že došlo k úniku dat, nelze automaticky vyvozovat spáchání přestupku. Tak by se dalo shrnout rozsudku Nejvyššího správního soudu (NSS) v případu úniku osobních údajů ze serverů společnosti Mall.cz v roce 2017. Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů (ÚOOÚ) nemůže udělovat pokuty za úniky dat z firem jen na základě toho, že k úniku došlo. Musí také zkoumat, jestli firma přijala dostatečná opatření k jejich ochraně.</span>

                    <span>Yesterday, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition disappeared from sale on PC less than 24 hours after launch. At the same time, the Rockstar Games launcher also fell offline - the only place the PC version was available. 

Now, the launcher is back, but the Definitive Edition remains unavaiable to buy or play while Rockstar &quot;remove files unintentionally included in these versions.&quot;

                    <span>I think I&#x27;ve figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I&#x27;ll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and &quot;HD&quot; texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

                    <span>Listen, folks, I&#x27;m going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don&#x27;t get Dark Souls. I&#x27;ve tried to play FromSoftware&#x27;s much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I&#x27;m simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I&#x27;ve come to realise I simply don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to see it through. I&#x27;m not sure I ever will, either. 
It&#x27;s the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I&#x27;ve fallen hook, line and sinker for Death&#x27;s Door, the crow reaper sword &#x27;em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

                    <span>I arrive at this episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang thoroughly shootered. Both big FPS releases of the month, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, have been at my fingertips this week and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts. Of course, Imogen hits us with news too. Valorant has another new character coming out, Fortnite pulls Travis Scott, and Imogen gives us the lowdown on just how much she&#x27;s enjoying Apex Legends&#x27; latest season.

                    <span>Rockstar yesterday launched the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, a collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas rebuilt and remastered. Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

Folks who buy the Gold or Ultimate editions, or subscribe to EA Play Pro, can now hop on and start popping faces in Dice&#x27;s new FPS. Everyone else, hey, be glad that other people are paying to test the game for you so it&#x27;s in better shape later. Though reportedly voice chat won&#x27;t even be in by the time it properly launch so sheesh.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

                    <span>The Pokémon trading card game is the one piece of the Pokéverse I&#x27;ve not drowned in, but I do know that its digital version, Pokémon TCG Online, is meant to be lackluster. That&#x27;s where new iteration Pokémon TCG Live comes in, although you&#x27;ll have to wait a while longer for it than intended, as it was announced today that its open beta has been delayed until 2022.

The islands of Oshur are a tropical paradise and a &quot;return to the game&#x27;s roots,&quot; say the developers.

FFI through IV have all come out over the past year, with IV landing back in September. Now Final Fantasy V has joined the party, letting you play the classic RPG with more faithful artwork than the derided mobile ports that were available previously.

                    <span>A trio of vintage crimeworlds returned rebuilt today with the launch of the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, bundling GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas into one collection with an long overly name. They look fancier and more modern (the originals being from 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively), and have control schemes which are less damn old. Unfortunately, they have also cut some of my favourite songs from the radio, boooo.

                    <span>Starfield is a very long way away - actually, it&#x27;s set to release exactly one year from today. We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m once again back, and I&#x27;m badder than ever! To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

It&#x27;s now due in spring 2022. Pavonis Interactive state the usual reason: they want more time to make it good. Please do! After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

                    <span>Ahead of Skyrim Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch, a developer behind a vital modding tool warned that the release might also break mods for Skyrim Special Edition, badly. Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.

                    <span>One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

                    <span>This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

                    <span>It&#x27;s Skyrim&#x27;s 10th birthday today, so Bethesda have released yet another version of their epic fantasy RPG to celebrate. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is out now, adding a bunch of Creation Club content, like fishing, aquariums and more. Plus, owners of the game&#x27;s Special Edition will get a handful of freebies too. It&#x27;s no Elder Scrolls 6, but hey, fish are nice. So, how many copies of Skyrim will you own after today?

                    <span>If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

                    <span>Thunderful World took place tonight. It offered a look at several games from Thunderful, the biggest of which was a new SteamWorld third-person co-op action game. Below you&#x27;ll find that and every other game from the show that is headed to PC.

                    <span>Paco Rabanne describe the robot-shaped bottle for their new fragrance, Phantom, as &quot;your new wingman.&quot; The advert shows this in action, with the robot floating through a party, its behaviour on a spectrum somewhere between a &#x27;90s dancing baby meme and a horny BB-8.

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. &quot;It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character&quot; is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.
