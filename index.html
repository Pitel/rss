However, you won&#x27;t see the outfit lying neatly on a table in one piece, and it&#x27;s your job to figure out exactly where each part is.


All Training Uniform piece locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley


There are four parts to the training uniform during the A New Recruit quest:



Training Pants


Training Shirt


Training Shoes


Training Socks



While some of these pieces are within the camp itself, others require you to venture outside the area and into the forest.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s Mulan Realm is the ninth realm added to the game and features two characters: Mulan and Mushu. Before you can find and befriend these two, you&#x27;ll have to unlock their realm, explore the region, and complete their friendship questlines.


Where to find the Mulan Realm in Disney Dreamlight Valley


You&#x27;ll find the Mulan Realm on the third floor of Dreamlight Castle, right next to the Beauty and the Beast door. It costs 15,000 Dreamlight to unlock, making it as costly as the Monster&#x27;s Inc. Realm.

After entering the castle and ascending the stairs, look for a door with a dragon symbol covered by night thorns. Interacting with the door initiates a conversation with Merlin, prompting you to pay the Dreamlight price. Once you pay the cost, you can enter the realm, begin the New Recruit quest, and meet both Mushu and Mulan, with the area now accessible forever if you ever wish to return later.


How to get more Dreamlight in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Dreamlight is a currency you use to unlock biomes and realms. You can obtain more by completing your Dreamlight Duties, which you can find through the Dreamlight tab in the main menu. These duties grant you around 100-250 Dreamlight per task, giving you a quick way to farm this resource.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Most Dreamlight Duties are fairly simple, with objectives such as removing night thorns, mining minerals, and selling produce. You can also find some in other categories that give you more Dreamlight as you reach milestones, but your best bet is to focus on the main duty list if you want to get this currency quickly.

Traditionally, Destiny 2 players only get one chance to watch a cutscene before they&#x27;re gone forever. Over the years, we&#x27;ve been trained to always be prepared for an important moment in the story just in case we have the only chance to see it. There&#x27;s nothing more devastating than missing a moment every other player has seen, such as the ending cutscene in The Final Shape. However, there&#x27;s a way to catch it if you didn&#x27;t see it due to a bug or time constraints.

                              <span>Perfume Bottles are a very interesting type of weapon in Elden Ring, and the Lightning Perfume Bottle is turning out to be a little bit meta right now. Therese are literal perfume bottles that have been turned into weapons by the dreaded Perfumers in the Lands Between, so it&#x27;s definitely a pretty unique weapon for an RPG like this.


Lightning Perfume Bottle Location





The Lightning Perfume Bottle can be found on a corpse in a shallow pond in the Cerulean Coast area just after you enter the area from Charo&#x27;s Hidden Grave. It is a little awkward to get due to the presence of a Furnace Golem and a patrolling ram that causes lightning strikes.

While certainly impressive and a great way of drawing attention to the iPhone 15 Pro, I had to wonder how much demand there was for such games to see native mobile ports. Turns out the answer is not a lot.


Recently, Mobilegamer.biz shared an analysis, based on estimates by Appfigures, on the performance of the mobile ports of Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding. To be blunt, it seems not a single one of these games has been profitable on mobile. Resident Evil 4, for example, launched on iOS on December 23, but is estimated to have only ma…</span>

MW3&#x27;s Season 4 Reloaded includes new map Incline, the Reclaimer 18 shotgun, and of course, the new Bit Party playlist that gives Modern Warfare an incredible retro look. 


If that sounds like your cup of tea, then here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the event, including its start date and how you can unlock those free rewards.

MW3 Retro Warfare start date


MW3&#x27;s Retro Warfare event starts on June 26, 2024, as part of the Season 4 Reloaded patch. The event will run for one week, coming to an end on July 3, 2024. 


How to unlock Retro Warfare rewards


If you want to unlock the free rewards that come with the Retro Warfare event, you&#x27;ll need to earn XP by playing matches and completing challenges. 


As always, there will be ten rewards in total, with the XP requirement increasing with each one. Should you make it all the way to the end, you will unlock a special skin themed after the event, as has become customary with MW3&#x27;s in-game events. 


Have we seen the Retro Warfare rewards yet?


No, we haven&#x27;t seen the Retro Warfare rewards just yet, and won&#x27;t until the event goes live with Season 4 Reloaded on June 26. 


Based on previous events, however, we expect to see calling cards, emblems, and weapon charms, along with a number of Double XP tokens to help you maximize your performance. 


We&#x27;ll update this piece once we&#x27;ve seen the rewards.

                              <span>Mesmerize is a mission you&#x27;ll need to tackle when working your way through the week 3 steps of Destiny 2&#x27;s A Rising Chorus: Act I questline. In it, you&#x27;re chasing down Saint-14, who has Osiris worried because he&#x27;s headed down to Nessus alone and won&#x27;t respond to any communications. 


You can start Mesmerize from the Director in Destiny 2 by opening the Nessus map. I went into this mission just over the recommended power level of 1945, but it was still incredibly difficult. The Vex throw everything they have and the kitchen sink at you, so be prepared for a big old fight with multiple stages to battle through. I used The Call because it&#x27;s an incredible weapon, but as long as you&#x27;re using something you&#x27;re comfortable with, you should be in with a chance.

                              <span>The meta in Elden Ring is ever changing as players find new things to crush their enemies with. Right now, Ash of War: Rolling Sparks is definitely a highly sought-after item because of how it interacts with some weapons and its build potential. If you are wondering where to go to get this particular skill, then I have you covered.


Ash of War: Rolling Sparks Location





To get the Ash of War: Rolling Sparks, you will need to go to the eastern side of the camp at the south of Shadow Keep. You can get there easily by following the road north from the Highroad Cross Site of Grace at the back of Castle Ensis; just make sure to avoid the attention of the massive Furance Golem if it is still alive. Here, at the northernmost point of the camp, you will find a hill. Climb that hill, and you wi…</span>

While this hardly means FromSoftware&#x27;s going to introduce an easy mode any time soon, it has put out a calibration update to try and make things more balanced.


This update, as detailed on Bandai Namco&#x27;s website, primarily revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings, which is Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s unique leveling system for boosting the attack and defence of your character and spirit summons. This is done by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes.

While some players have called them a ghost, their name is The Wanderer, and I&#x27;m here to explain who they are, and what purpose they serve. 


This ghost-like character has been living up to his name, moving around the island seemingly oblivious to the carnage that&#x27;s going on around them. Get too close, and sometimes they just disappear, leaving you bewildered and wondering if you actually saw them at all. 


Who is The Wanderer?


Truthfully, we don&#x27;t know yet. Interestingly, however, The Wanderer has been teased throughout Season 3 if you know where to look for the clues.

Capcom and GOG have joined forces in an effort to both preserve the original Resident Evil games and bring them to PC, a platform where they&#x27;ve never been available. You can buy the game on GOG now for $10/£8.99 and wishlist the next two classic titles, both of which will be available soon.

Best Sigewinne healer support build


As a pure healer support, Sigewinne only cares about her HP stat. She doesn’t need Energy Recharge except to trigger the 4pc Noblesse Oblige artifact set. She doesn’t need CRIT or ATK, since she’s not doing damage. Just build as much HP as possible.


Equip any weapon that has an HP secondary stat. Sigewinne’s best weapon is her 5-star signature, Silvershower Heartstrings. However, you can just as easily equip the 3-star Recurve Bow and still have plenty of healing. Recurve Bows can be found in chests in Mondstadt or from certain NPCs. Recurve Bow doesn’t…</span>

                              <span>If your team is looking for a healer, why not bring nurse Sigewinne on board? Sigewinne is a flexible healer in Genshin Impact, and though she can slot into many teams, here&#x27;s where she shines the brightest.


Sigewinne in Furina teams


Sigewinne offsets Furina’s HP drain and enables more Fanfare stacks, boosting your whole team’s damage while keeping them alive. As Hydro characters, the two can also provide Energy for one another, reducing the need to build Energy Recharge. Sigewinne will also provide a small buff to her teammates’ Skill damage.

Bosses are tougher, enemies are hitting harder, and just about everything takes more time to kill. This is juxtaposed by a moment of sweet tenderness at the end of the game.


What happens if Miquella steals your heart in Elden Ring?


There will be spoilers ahead for the end of the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.


The final battle in Elden Ring is against the Promised Consort Radahn. That&#x27;s right! You thought you had seen the last of this murderous maniac in the main game, but the boy is back. He is just as brutal to deal with as he was in the base game but for different reasons this time.


One of these mechanics is that he will reach out and try to hug you. This is Miquella trying to steal…</span>

                              <span>The Dryleaf Dane quest is one you should carefully follow while going through the Shadow Realm in Elden Ring. While he isn’t outright crucial to the main story at hand, his quest shouldn’t be missed as he’ll be of possible use to you for assistance and his drops.


How to complete the Dryleaf Dane quest in Elden Ring


To start this quest, you must first beat Rellana. Upon defeating her, progress further until you reach the Highroad Cross Site of Grace. Here, you’ll run into Leda and Hornsent. An item can be acquired around them called the Monk’s Missive.


This message is basically an invitation for a duel against Dryleaf Dane. From here, make your way eastward until you come across the Moorth Ruins Site of Grace. Here, Dane will be awaiting your response. Talking to him won’t do anything. You have to perform the “May the Best Win” Gesture.




You’ll then be transported to an area where you fight him. Upon defeating him, he’ll drop his Hand-to-Hand weapon, the Dryleaf Arts, and his hat. You won’t hear from him again until you progress significantly through the story.


Once you have beaten Messmer, the Impaler, and progressed through the Ancient Ruins of Rauh, you’re going to have to fight Romina, Saint of the Bud. You’ll see a golden summon sign just before the fight where you can invoke Dane for the fight. You don’t have to do this, but he’s there if you need him.

After beating Romina, your next step is to burn the Sealing Tree. This is an irreversible action that acts as the point of no return, so make sure to progress as far as you can with all other NPCs at this point. 


At Enir-Ilim, you’ll encounter Dryleaf Dane once more alongside Leda. Once they are all done and dealt with, you can then retrieve the rest of his set, which includes his headgear, chest piece, gloves, and pants.

Once again, the world is on the cusp of being taken over by the evil General Donald Morden and his Rebel Army. Only the Peregrine Falcon Squad, led by the heroic Marco Rossi, stand in the way of the Rebels establishing their New World Order. This could be the plot of just about any entry in the Metal Slug series, which is at its best when you don’t take it too seriously. Metal Slug Attack Reloaded, a remake of a microtransaction-laden gacha tower-defence mobile game, does its best to uphold the goofy tone of the series while stripping out the worst bits of the 2016 version.
At least, it does its best to take the frustrating bits out. The Switch version doesn’t have any microtransactions, thankfully – but it does still very much feel like a gacha game that expects you to log in every day and grind your way to victory. The result is an uneven but still enjoyable game that is constrained by its origins.

                              <span>&quot;A prisoner has escaped! Sound the alarm!&quot;.
We have some wildly vivid memories of playing a demo for the original Little Big Adventure included with a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK before getting our hands on the full game. It was such a uniquely weird title. You could switch your stances depending on the situation; so if you want to whallop a guard, you&#x27;d toggle the &#x27;aggressive&#x27; stance and throw a few punches before hightailing it with the &#x27;athletic&#x27; stance. So good.
Now, in Fall 2024, a full remake titled Little Big Adventure - Twinsen&#x27;s Quest will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch from Microids and studio , boasting completely revamped visuals, a modernised control system, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

Ahead of the arrival of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak next month on the Switch, it seems an English localisation of the sequel is also on the way.
Although a local announcement for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II was already possibly being teased ahead of this year&#x27;s Anime Expo, a PlayStation 5 user discovered the Japanese store page logo changes to English when the system is set to display in English.

Although there&#x27;s been no official announcement about a second Kombat Pack just yet, according to a dataminer known as &#x27;interloko&#x27; on social media - six more characters, two new arenas, and five new announcers are apparently getting ready to join the fight.

We&#x27;ve gathered some of the reviews already doing the rounds online (and to let you know, we’re working on our own at the time of writing, so watch this space). While not every single one is focused on the Switch release, they still offer an idea of what you can expect if you are a returning to this title, which originally made its debut on the GameCube and other platforms in 2003.

By now, you might have seen some stories about the team behind Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD. While the original 3DS release in 2013 was made by the talented Canadian-based studio Next Level Games, for the game&#x27;s high-definition Switch version, it seems Nintendo has once again called on the services of the Australian developer Tantalus Media.
The Aussie Nintendo fansite Vooks.net highlighted this in its review of the game, with multiple outlets like IGN and VGC also confirming this studio&#x27;s major involvement in the project just a day out from the game&#x27;s official launch.

Luigi makes a very spooky return this week in Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD for the Nintendo Switch. Of course, as you likely already know, this new release is a high-definition port of the original 2013 3DS release. The reviews for the title are already rolling in and so far they&#x27;ve been quite positive.
In our review here on Nintendo Life, we gave the game a &quot;great&quot; score of 8 out of 10, calling it the best way to play Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 as of 2024, but also felt it could have maybe included some extra content to make it a little more appealing for returning players.

                              <span>Fallen Aces is a stylish FPS lead pipe ‘em up with immersive sim elements, published by good gun-knowers New Blood Interactive. Your gumshoe ‘tagonist wakes up, hungover of brain, skint of wallet, and unshaven of face, to discover your apartment - undoubtedly reeking of smokerettes and dehydration wee - is being broken into by foes goonly and mookish. They take a while to boot the door down, which gives you a moment to observe the place and consider which of Fallen Aces&#x27; expansive makeshift weapon selection you&#x27;d like to batter them with. Decisions, decisions...

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent. In the pan.

                              <span>Game development studio and intergalactic war ministry Arrowhead have launched a new series of written update posts for players of Helldivers 2 to help keep the war record straight. Mostly, this is the usual case of somebody on the team gathering quotes as the developers batter their fingertips against keyboards to bring you, the video gamer, fresh cannons and what-have-you. But there is some insight into what the conflict-pushers at Arrowhead have enjoyed most about player actions over the last month, including bringing an entire planet to the liberated state of post-existence.

Sod&#x27;s Law struck that day… and it&#x27;s returned with a smirk. Shadow Of The Erdtree has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.

                              <span>With a groan, it rises. The first Resident Evil is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don&#x27;t have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It&#x27;s going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

                              <span>The human body is a wonderfully complex organism, and it’s well worth trusting your instincts when it comes to feeling repulsed by certain things. We know that if the milk looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. Do not taste the forbidden yogurt, as much as it calls to you. How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting Shadow Of The Erdtree build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the Elden Ring DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.

If you haven&#x27;t played it, you should buy it quick - because it&#x27;s being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.

                              <span>The one and only Elden Ring expansion we&#x27;re getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn&#x27;t – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads &quot;1.12.2&quot; if it has – select &quot;LOGIN&quot; and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you&#x27;ve previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you&#x27;re encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game&#x27;s system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software&#x27;s Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook&#x27;s body, including things like a Qunari&#x27;s horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…</span>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

                              <span>Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There&#x27;s no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot;


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.</span>

                              <span>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game&#x27;s original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney&#x27;s original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey&#x27;s actions shape his destiny and the game&#x27;s story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.</span>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi&#x27;s sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…</span>

                              <span>The Elden Ring DLC is a tough piece of video game, but thankfully it isn&#x27;t completely malicious. The DLC includes more ways to strengthen your character, such as new Talismans. I suggest you find the Spelldrake Talisman +3 in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for the best magic defense.


The Spelldrake Talisman +3 is in a cave along a cliffside near the &#x27;Castle Front&#x27; encampment Site of Grace. If you have the Site unlocked, you can start your quest for the Talisman there. If not, you&#x27;ll need to travel to the Castle Front encampment located northeast from where you begin Shadow of the Erdtree. To get there, you must cross the Ellac Greatbridge, which has a few enemies and a guy guarding the encampment with a large ballista that fires tree-sized bolts — which explode.

                              <span>There&#x27;s an undeniable beauty to witnessing an entire planet being destroyed both on screen and in science fiction novels. However, for me, the latter is always more affecting, and many of them have left lasting impacts with their sheer brilliance. 


The most impressive times planets have been destroyed in sci-fi


As with any list, this is not exhaustive, and although I do consider myself a good researcher and avid reader, I may have missed a few. I am sure the glaring ones I fail to write will be pulled up, and I will surely read many I have missed. However, these are the planetary destructions I remember from sci-fi. Hopefully, there will be some new ones and memories of old for all. Beware, there are spoilers ahead.

                              <span>Apex Legends is an online multiplayer first-person shooter game, which naturally requires several servers to be set up, as per region requirements. The servers play a huge part in the overall gameplay experience in online shooter games since the game has to take into account multiple real-time player inputs. This makes ping an integral aspect for players, and it is recommended for players to ensure that their ping is as low as possible, which translates into the game receiving player inputs quicker.


Apex Legends has several regions covering North America and Europe and typically has at least one server per region in Asia and Africa. However, there are also several countries that do not have a dedicated server, largely due to a lack of a substantial player base. For players in those regio…</span>

                              <span>One of the most enduring parts of Beyond Good &amp; Evil for me is its soundtrack. Now I can relive it (as if it hasn’t lived in my head since 2003), with the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary soundtrack on vinyl.


Two tracks in particular are standouts for me. The first is Slaughterhouse Scramble, which includes what I am pretty sure are gibberish lyrics sung by someone who is just so damned invested in their performance. Say what you will about the crunchy, three power-chord backing, but that vocalist is just wrecking house.


Another is what I think the album calls “Salud Juanito!” but I remember it as either “Spanish Bar” or “Fun and Mini Games.” I don’t understand Spanish, so I don’t know what to say about this one aside from the fact that it’s a banger.


We had a foosball table in the house, which I used to play with a roommate. I created a playlist, and both of these songs were on it. There was a third on there that was more of a boss theme. It was called “Dancing with DomZ” on old internet playlists, but I’m not sure what it’s listed on the album.


Anyway. Back to the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary vinyl. It’s two discs and pressed into orange and green marbled vinyl. These mighty slabs contain 39 tracks from the game. I highlighted two, but the soundtrack is solid as a whole, with some great variety. I’d probably buy it but I’d need more storage for my vinyl.


The Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary soundtrack is scheduled for release in September 2024, and is being sold by Wayo Records.

                              <span>The Final Shape expansion introduced a proverbial ton of content into Destiny 2. From a new campaign and Exotic weapons to Subclass and weapon balance updates, post-The Final Shape Destiny 2 is almost like a new game. However, Bungie is now rolling back one change after players got vocal about their disapproval. Elemental Surges are no more in the Raid and Dungeon scene, or at least, they don&#x27;t matter anymore. 


Players weren&#x27;t in love with all the changes introduced by The Final Shape. Specifically, many Guardians weren&#x27;t fans of the -5 power disadvantage and elemental Surges imposed by Raids and Dungeons. The idea was that, as long as players used weapons and abilities highlighted by the Surges, the -5 wouldn&#x27;t matter. However, players took the change as a limitation on builds and weapon choice since elements not benefitting from the Surge would be at that -5 power deficit.


On June 20, Bungie addressed the Surge situation in a This Week in Destiny post, announcing, &quot;We have decided to remove surges from raids and dungeons in next week&#x27;s update, as well as to adjust tuning so that you&#x27;ll perform as if you had them across the board. This means the damage bonus will now be applied to all subclass damage types, including Kinetic, by default.&quot; In addition to the Surge news, Bungie reminded players that the -5 only pertained to damage output, not defenses.


While the -5 disadvantage is still there in some form, forever Surges on all elements almost make it a non-issue. Of course, Bungie noted that it would monitor how the changes feel for players to see if further adjustments are needed.

                              <span>The Storeroom Key in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is likely one of the two keys you can stumble on while traveling through Belurat, the Tower Settlement. But once you find out where to take it, you have one more mystery to solve.


The Storeroom Key can easily be found on a corpse as you make your way through Belurat toward the boss fight. It&#x27;ll be hard to miss since the body is along the path. In other words, it&#x27;s not as hard to track down as the Well Depths Key. Speaking of which, to find the Storeroom Key in Belurat, we must start at the same Site of Grace needed for said Well Depths Key.

                              <span>Giants Software&#x27;s Farming Simulator 25 will be released on November 12, 2024; fans have been waiting years to get their hands on it. Given that players will spend so much time in the game, having an edition that reflects that dedication makes sense. 


The Farming Simulator series has a hardcore fan base that spends dozens of hours each week perfecting their farms, mastering machinery, and establishing the best setup possible for producing crops and managing livestock. Farming Simulator 25 is the type of game that you could justify a specialized farming simulation controller for on any platform, which is why some fans want to have a collector&#x27;s edition that shows off just how much they love it.

                              <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s new Salvation&#x27;s Edge raid is beyond difficult, providing a lot of encounters that require both immense team coordination and stellar DPS. However, it makes completing the raid all the sweeter. Once you&#x27;ve completed it, you&#x27;ll receive a new item that&#x27;s immensely confusing at first. Here&#x27;s what to do with the Memory of the Witness in Destiny 2.


Where should I take the Memory of the Witness in Destiny 2?

Once you get the Memory of the Witness, you&#x27;ll want to run Excision. This is the new 12-player activity, and can be found next to the Salvation&#x27;s Edge raid on the Pale Heart Destination Map. Once in the mission, proceed to the end, and you&#x27;ll find a bonus chest. Use the Memory of the Witness on this chest to receive one of the raid weapons with a Deepsight imprint on it.


If you aren&#x27;t already aware, this Deepsight imprint lets you use this weapon in crafting to create a god roll version of that weapon, provided you know the best perks and attachments. You will need to use this weapon a bit though to increase its pattern progress.


Can you get multiple Memories of the Witness?


You can technically get multiple Memories of the Witness. However, there are a few catches to that. For one, it&#x27;s once per account per week, so you can&#x27;t get three each week off each of your characters. It also doesn&#x27;t stack, so you should use your key as soon as possible after getting it so you don&#x27;t screw yourself over later. With some persistence, you should be able to get the Deepsight versions of all weapons if you want them.

                              <span>Every new Call of Duty season usually adds new content while keeping the standard gameplay loop relatively the same. However, Activision is looking to shake things up a little bit with Season 4 with the introduction of an all-new game mode in the form of a unique playlist modifier called Bit Party, a pixel-inspired playlist.




Minecraft Steve would be proud of the new mode, which allows players to experience the multiplayer of Call of Duty in a new lens. In Bit Party mode, eliminating enemies causes your Operator&#x27;s head to inflate, with it resetting back to normal when you are eliminated. Even though the increased head size will certainly make you an easier target, it also gives you some perks. The bigger your head, the more points you earn for completing objectives in multiplayer.


The Retro Warfare event is also kicking off alongside the new playlist, as well as the addition of pixel-art-inspired members of Task Force 141 and a new 8-Bit Blitz Bundle. Pixelated Operator skins will feature Ghost, Price, Soap, and Farah, as well as a pixelated 8-Bit Tracer and red Violence Death EFfect for the Striker SMG and SVA 545 Assault Rifle.


Call of Duty Season 4 Reloaded will also add a new Core 6v6 map titled Incline, taking place in the snowy mountains of Urzikstan. Several new game-altering modes are also launching with this season including Mutation, Havoc, Headshots Only, and Blueprint Gunfight.


The Call of Duty Season 4 Reloaded kicks off across all platforms on June 26 at 12p.m EST.

Beahm&#x27;s ban from Twitch in 2020 was surrounded with an air of mystery, as very little public reasoning was given for the streamer getting booted from the platform.

                              <span>Brawl Star&#x27;s Mega Boxes are making a comeback in the Classic Brawl event, going a step above the traditional loot boxes. But since there are various ways to locate this item, we&#x27;ll show what steps you need to take to get it.


Where to find Mega Boxes in Brawl Stars


You can get Mega Boxes in Brawl Stars by earning Star Tokens or purchasing them in the Shop while the Classic Brawl event is active. The event will run from July 12 to July 31. So, make sure to tune in during this time.


To earn Star Tokens, players can do the following techniques:



Get a first win in designated game modes


Collect from Special Quests


Participate in Mega Box Challenges



You&#x27;ll need to rack up a ton of Star Tokens to open Mega Boxes. To do this, participate in Classic Brawl Update&#x27;s exclusive modes: Mirror Match and Drum Roll. But if you want to speed up the process, the boxes can be purchased in the Shop.


When you crack open a Mega Box in Brawl Stars, you&#x27;re in for a treat with a chance to earn these exciting rewards:



New Rico Hypercharge Skin


Coins


Power Points


Bling


Gems


XP Doublers


Brawlers


Player Icons


Pins


Skins



The Rico Hypercharge Skin unlocks after you&#x27;ve opened a considerable amount of Mega Boxes. You may also uncover other variants for this character with the event&#x27;s Hypercharge Skins and Chromas. These cosmetics change up Rico&#x27;s look even more, especially with the shiny Sovereign Bling outfit.

Unleash your nostalgia with the Mega Boxes, offering a range of classic character skins like Stellar Shelly, Boomer Dynamike, Deputy Brock, and Sheriff Shelly. Each cosmetic is a tribute to the game&#x27;s early 2019 version, inspired by the Brawler&#x27;s Classic looks.

                              <span>The 92+ PTG, MYM, or MYM Plus Player Pick SBC is the best shot for EA FC 24 players to get a promo item, and EA Sports has featured two different versions for the community.


This SBC guarantees either a card from the recently released Path to Glory and Make Your Mark promos. Only the cards rated 92 or higher have been included in the pool of rewards, which certainly makes the SBC lot more rewarding. Let&#x27;s take a look at all the possible items you could find after completing this SBC.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC yet hovers at Mixed in the blood-encrusted annals of the Steam user review consensus. As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion&#x27;s difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can&#x27;t press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don&#x27;t want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

The RPG in question is Broke Signal Badlands: A World of Desert Adventure, and yes, that&#x27;s a very upbeat subtitle for a game in which you can perish after getting your hand stuck in the door of an abandoned Fonts Museum, or while yanking cacti out of your foot. There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I&#x27;ve only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

                              <span>Cyan Worlds&#x27; remake of their 1997-released Myst sequel Riven launches today on Steam. Word on the reviewvine is that it&#x27;s jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker&#x27;s shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

                              <span>The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It&#x27;s like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game&#x27;s background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can&#x27;t work together to escape the inferno. Right?

                              <span>A corn dog is something I’ve never eaten, because they’re not really a thing in UK. I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

                              <span>The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don&#x27;t worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That&#x27;s a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat &#x27;em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don&#x27;t know any other objects associated with this mythological &quot;summer&quot; people talk about, I&#x27;m from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that&#x27;ll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.

                              <span>Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

                              <span>News reports from South Korea, reveal that Internet provider KT actively installed malware on the computers of over half a million subscribers. The malware was intended to interfere with BitTorrent traffic, presumably as a network management solution. A police investigation suggests that cost savings likely played a role too, which is not surprising given local file-sharing habits.

                              <span>Major recording labels, including UMG and Sony have filed a pair of broadly similar copyright complaints against two key generative AI music services. The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels&#x27; music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they&#x27;re already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were &#x27;evasive&#x27; on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

Developer Witch Beam isn&#x27;t ready to rest on its laurels. After creating two wildly different games — the twin-stick shooter Assault Android Cactus and the BAFTA award-winning, heartfelt puzzler Unpacking — it&#x27;s ready to move back to the outside and go with something even more relaxing.
We were tapping our foot the whole way through the trailer for the Brisbane-based studio&#x27;s third title, Tempopo. Combining music with the outside world, the game sees Hana — a young magical girl living in the clouds — restoring her musical garden of flowers. All of her Tempopo creatures have magical abilities and are bursting with personality, but only Hana can tell them where to go and guide them along the right path.

Would you believe it, there&#x27;s yet another major Switch release just on the horizon, with Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD launching this week on 27th June 2024.
All told, it seems as though this one is exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to be: an HD upgrade of a 3DS game on Switch. As such, many fans have understandably questioned the game&#x27;s price tag when compared to something like Metroid Prime Remastered. Still, it seems like it might still be worth checking out if you&#x27;re after more Luigi&#x27;s Mansion.

Do you feel that chill? It&#x27;s probably the haunting presence of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD which will be bringing the spooks to Switch this Thursday (27th June). We have already shared our thoughts on Nintendo&#x27;s latest remaster, calling it &quot;the exact same game that many of you will have no doubt played 11 years ago - it just looks much nicer&quot; in our review and now Digital Foundry has stepped in to provide a full technical analysis on the release.
All in all, things look rather swell. Naturally, the majority of the Digital Foundry analysis is dedicated to the visual upgrade, calling it a &quot;smart, clean enhancement&quot; and noting the massive boost in polygon count. According to the outlet, the remaster targets native 1080p in docked mode and 720p in handheld, with anti-aliasing on both offering some of the console&#x27;s &quot;best image quality&quot;.

Looking back over our 2013 review of Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon on the 3DS has been a timely reminder of why we love this game so very much, yet have failed to return to it beyond our original playthrough back in the day - an oddity, given that we&#x27;re quite partial to hoovering up every last secret there is to find in most games we enjoy.
It was the controls, you see. They were fiddly in the first Luigi&#x27;s Mansion, and in the second game the lack of an extra thumbstick on the 3DS made for an experience that felt marred slightly by the shortcomings of the system on which it was delivered. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal — this writer is still very much in agreement with the 9/10 score dished out by this site at the time — it was always just one of those things with this series. A great idea, smart games, excellent puzzles and tons of atmosphere, all held back a little bit. A franchise that felt like it needed unleashing onto a new platform.

                              <span>In for a penny, in for a pand.
Developer Game Freak has been known to dabble in projects outside of the Pokémon franchise, producing the likes of the excellent Pocket Card Jockey and Little Town Hero, and now it&#x27;s just launched a new mobile game called Pand Land (thanks, Siliconera). If you remember, the company filed trademarks for the title at the start of the year, but we weren&#x27;t too sure what it was all about at the time.
Although there&#x27;s no word on a worldside release at the time of writing, Pand Land is available via Android and iOS in Japan. Described as a casual marine adventure RPG, you travel the lands with your crew to collect various bits of treasure. Boasting some rather charming voxel-based visuals, you&#x27;ll also explore dangerous dungeons and can tackle the game either on your own or with friends.

If you&#x27;re a staunch fan of the 3DS, then chances are you&#x27;ve dabbled in the Streetpass and Spotpass features over the years. The latter, of course, is no longer available since Nintendo shut down the online servers, but if you&#x27;re out and about with your 3DS, then you can still benefit from the StreetPass function (that is, if you find anyone else with their own console).
One of the games that made use of the StreetPass function was Puzzle Swap, which allowed you to slowly reveal images via new tiles. Some of these were exclusive images offered via the Spotpass feature, and a group of fans is currently on the hunt for one last image.

Last week was very busy in the land of Nintendo with a new Direct and all sorts of announcements including a new batch of Switch Online titles. One of the releases happened to be the Game Boy Advance classic Metroid: Zero Mission.
If you weren&#x27;t already aware, this game comes with a special Metroid Fusion gallery. As highlighted by multiple sources, the original version required players to have access to both Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion as well as a link cable and two GBA. Fortunately, this latest digital release now has this feature unlocked.

According to select retailers, Capcom will be offering the complete collection on the game cartridge (or disc, if you&#x27;re buying the game for PlayStation), with no downloads required. So it will be fully playable in its release state! Keep in mind, there could still be at least some patches and updates post-launch to sort out bugs or glitches.

Palworld had an extremely successful launch when it arrived on Xbox and PC earlier this year, so will we ever see it on Nintendo&#x27;s current generation system?
Speaking to Game File, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe mentioned how this Pokémon-like game with guns has higher specs, so it could be &quot;hard to port to Switch&quot; due to &quot;technical reasons&quot; (thanks, VGC). Fortunately, the Switch &quot;successor&quot; is just around the corner, so who knows what might happen in the future.

                              <span>When testing Intel&#x27;s aggressive software Linux optimizations shipped by way of their in-house Clear Linux distribution, I am most often testing it on their high core count Xeon processors with AVX-512... Over the years in dozens of Phoronix articles there have been countless metrics showing off the out-of-the-box performance benefits from leveraging software built for higher x86_64 micro-architecture feature levels, employing compiler-based function multi-versioning, and the other extensive performance tuning carried out by Intel software engineers. But now with the Intel Xeon 6700E &quot;Sierra Forest&quot; series now being available for these all-E-core server processors, I was curious about quantifying the Clear Linux benefits over the likes of Ubuntu Linux. Here are those benchmarks for those curious about the difference.</span>

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s Guardia di Finanza has just outlined an anti-piracy investigation it links to Euro 2024. The operation led to searches targeting 13 pirate IPTV administrators, and 1.3 million pirate viewers reportedly had their screens &quot;blacked out.&quot; The statement raises several important questions, but the decision to mention the &quot;completely innovative way&quot; the pirates obtained the content is not something usually discussed in public.

                              <span>Roguelikes! They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: Diablo 4, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.

                              <span>The end of EA’s decades-long FIFA deal in 2022 means there’s currently a FIFA-shaped hole in the world of video games that isn’t quite filled by EA’s not-FIFA replacement EA Sports FC 24 and is yet to measure up the efforts of whoever the footballing organisation gets to make the next officially licensed FIFA game. So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game Rocket League.

                              <span>Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to &quot;never say never&quot; about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of &quot;I’m not holding my breath&quot;, Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. &quot;A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen&quot;, Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being &quot;fans&quot; of the game.

                              <span>A former developer at Total War studio Creative Assembly has written a lengthy personal account of his time at the studio, in which he details development troubles on strategy game Total War: Rome 2 and Total War: Attila, and alleges that these issues were exacerbated by an inflexible and counterproductive leadership structure and “chronic mismanagement,” sometimes resulting in what he calls a “toxic work environment.”

                              <span>I have recently moved to an area that’s surrounded by forest, or at least, by swathes of greenery that feel like forests when you’re far enough inside them, even if they don’t meet whatever quantifiable definition is currently in vogue. My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes Engraving to transform all those dreams into nightmares.

Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it&#x27;s just two guys in a lion suit. They aren&#x27;t even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

                              <span>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, Shadow Of The Erdtree is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.

Pro zranitelnost ale ani nemusí být TPM přítomen. Chyba byla objevena v Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 7th Gen a X1 Yoga 4th Gen. Nicméně Phoenix později oznámil, že se chyba týká patrně všech jejich UEFI firmware s procesory Intel AlderLake, CoffeeLake, CometLake, IceLake, JasperLake, KabyLake, MeteorLake, RaptorLake, RocketLake a TigerLake. Zranitelné tedy jsou tedy stovky modelů od Lenovo, Dell, Acer a HP.</span>

GSD, via GamesIndustry.biz, has shared the latest sales data for the video game market across Europe in May 2024, and it looks to have been a quiet month. So quiet, in fact, that the entire top ten failed to sell as many copies as May 2023&#x27;s highly-anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
Across physical and digital data from the major European markets (excluding Nintendo which doesn&#x27;t share digital figures), Game sales dropped 17% in May 2024, compared to the same period last year. That&#x27;s still 11.6 million game sales.

The latest UK charts are in, and would you believe it, EA Sports FC 24 is once again back on top as the Euro 2024 group stages get in full swing.

                              <span>Ollie is beset by maladies unknown today, so this is my domain now. I was tempted to recreate a hellish mockery of his fun hidden face game by trapping a crumbling mirror image of his visage, Dorian Gray style, somewhere in the above image. Alas, my version of Photoshop appears to be lacking that function. I suppose I will have to turn to other avenues of entertainment, such as a video game, should any exist.

                              <span>E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It&#x27;s Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend.

                              <span>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it&#x27;s always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


&quot;Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we&#x27;ll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5&#x27;s hardware.&quot; 
Though Mojang hasn&#x27;t revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to &quot;Settings&quot; on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select &quot;Preview.&quot; This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he&#x27;s playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix&#x27;s animated Minecraft series.

                              <span>Champion Shift is a Vampire Survivors-like I’ve been having quite a bit of fun with for the last few weeks. That’s partly because it’s a solid top-down auto-shooter with roguelike elements, and mostly because you can transform into a freakin’ car.

While there are plenty of intriguing secrets hiding in the new corner (it’s a big corner) of the Lands Between, Steam Deck players might stumble upon a not-so-welcome new discovery too, courtesy of a bug that can make your game unresponsive.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 was announced back in 2008, around 16 years ago. I remember writing about that trailer of Pey&#x27;j the porcine mechanic eating a fly for a blog somewhere. &quot;Fly-eating mechanics confirmed?&quot; I probably scribbled, in the blessed innocence of youth.

When they showed you&#x27;d be running a noodle bar and fishing in the slums instead of flying a hovercar around, I went into full wishlisty mode. Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you&#x27;re intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what&#x27;s coming.

                              <span>Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an &quot;Innapropriate activity detected&quot; message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven&#x27;t had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there&#x27;s a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

                              <span>Five men accused of operating one of the largest pirate IPTV services in the United States, have been convicted by a Las Vegas federal jury. Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber, generated millions of dollars in revenue through Jetflicks, a subscription service that reportedly offered more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime. Four of the men face up to five years in prison; Dallmann&#x27;s maximum is 48 years.

                              <span>A man convicted of copyright infringement violations while operating a pirate IPTV service, had his sentence significantly increased this week by a Swedish court of appeal. A lower court previously held that the defendant had infringed the rights of major movie and TV companies, but due to limited evidence, only for a week. The court of appeal disagreed after his own use of the service was uncovered during a police raid.

However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It&#x27;s here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, &quot;Why the name change?&quot; Here&#x27;s what each told me:

Avowed was featured as a major part of Xbox&#x27;s Summer presentations. The game appeared in the Xbox Game Showcase, and following the new footage, game director Carrie Patel appeared on the official Xbox podcast to share more gameplay and share more about the game. We caught up with Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo to find out even more about Avowed, covering what they think of comparisons to Skyrim, how they feel about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, why romance was considered for the game but ultimately not included, and why playing The Outer Worlds may gave you the best idea of what to expect from Avowed.

                              <span>Update, 3:42 p.m., 6/20/24:
Earlier today, Ubisoft accidentally posted a trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition alongside news the game would be coming to all platforms next week. However, shortly after, it deleted the post. Now, Ubisoft has reposted the news, confirming Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition is, in fact, real and launching on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 25. 
Check out the trailer for yourself in the announcement below:

Original story, 2:22 p.m., 6/20/24:
Last year, an Xbox store listing for Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition accidentally went live, with Ubisoft later stating it went up early due to a &quot;technical error.&quot; …</span>

                              <span>YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey&#x27;s E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it&#x27;s coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


&quot;Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece,&quot; Bigmode&#x27;s website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. &quot;Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive.&quot; 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and &quot;fish,&quot; whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s massive expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, goes live tomorrow, on June 21, and ahead of its launch, developer From Software has released a patch that adds new hairstyles, inventory options, balance adjustments, and more. It also allows you to summon your Spectral Steed during the game&#x27;s final fight (which, if you&#x27;ve beaten that boss, you know how helpful your mount would have been during it). 
The patch – V1.12 – is now live on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) and also features hundreds of other changes, like adjustments to weapons, skills, armaments, and general balance-related things. 
The highlight of the patch is all of the new features it adds to Elden Ring, and you can check those out below:

                              <span>Earlier this week, Paradox Interactive announced it was canceling Life By You, a simulation game meant to rival Sims in development at Paradox Tectonic. With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.
That Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. 
&quot;This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who&#x27;ve worked hard on Life By You&#x27;s Early Access release,&quot; Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. &quot;Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…</span>

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
&quot;Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise.

                              <span>If all goes according to plan, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield IPTV blocking system will be retired at the end of the year. In its place, Piracy Shield 2.0, a tech platform likely to be billed as the most formidable anti-piracy system on the planet. Year one running costs of two million euros will be paid by Italian taxpayers, rather than the main beneficiaries, some of the world&#x27;s most famous football clubs.

                              <span>Virtually anyone with an Internet connection can access pirated movies and TV shows in a few keystrokes. In some cases, an Internet connection isn&#x27;t even required. In Ghana, TV stations are reportedly showing pirated films to their viewers. This is so rampant that the Government&#x27;s film authority has issued a warning.

What exactly are the key architectural qualities of dwellings you might wish to go to bed with? Actually, don’t bother stretching your grey matter – you can just play Building Relationships, which is sort of A Short Hike but also, Love Island for anthropomorphic toy houses. There are demos on Itch and Steam. Be warned that you will be asked whether you’re a rooftop or a bottom floor.

                              <span>A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It&#x27;s also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by &quot;Project Phoenix&quot;, first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a &quot;visual prototype&quot; for a brand new Red Faction game.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the &#x27;default&#x27; option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

                              <span>Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn&#x27;t treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won&#x27;t guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They&#x27;re more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat&#x27;s hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it&#x27;s a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you&#x27;ll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.
Here&#x27;s our list of the 19 best roguelikes on PC you can play in 2024.

                              <span>We’re less than a day now from Shadow Of The Erdtree’s launch, and as promised, FromSoft have just released the latest patch (notes here) for the open world game. It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.
Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.

                              <span>“The Republic Of Pirates was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up strategy, out today with a demo on Steam at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

                              <span>The sinking terror that comes of having no fixed identity and being trapped alone thousands of metres beneath the ocean has been compacted into the soft, comforting (?) form of a plushie. Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game&#x27;s protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don&#x27;t report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

                              <span>Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate&#x27;s daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. &quot;It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I&#x27;m not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,&quot; he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood&#x27;s ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It&#x27;ll finally launch on PC later this year.

                              <span>You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It&#x27;s a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it&#x27;s not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

Despite the setback, the tool&#x27;s developers are not giving up.

                              <span>UK police are reporting yet another pirate IPTV-related arrest. A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

                              <span>The release of Sonic Generations in 2011 gave players a series-wide greatest hits remake package to celebrate 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog. Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it&#x27;s not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic&#x27;s abilities, but we&#x27;ve seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…</span>

Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in multiple seasons of a television show, in Fortnite, and now in Call of Duty.

                              <span>If you were playing Final Fantasy XIV in December 2021, you will remember the launch of its last expansion Endwalker - though not for all the right reasons. The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

                              <span>When it comes to the ultimate showdown of all-time great fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 might well take my personal bet for being the best of the best. I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.

An age rating for the 1996 survival-horror classic was recently confirmed by European suitability judges PEGI, hinting at an impending (re-)release for the almost three-decade-old zombie game.

                              <span>What to compare Nine Sols’ flowing Sekiro-like 2D combat and layered metroidvania exploration to? The eternally sequel-less Hollow Knight? The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

We&#x27;ll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He reckons it&#x27;s thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age&#x27;s combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.

There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

                              <span>When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. &quot;Gobshite&quot; became &quot;bastard&quot;. The &quot;polis&quot; were localised as the &quot;police&quot;. And every &quot;yersel&quot; sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became &quot;yourself&quot;. Well, turns out that&#x27;s the result of the game defaulting to &quot;International English&quot; for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There&#x27;s another option, says one of the game&#x27;s developers.

                              <span>Revealed at yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct stream - but absolutely coming to PC because there&#x27;s a Steam page for it - The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy seems like a mash-up of visual novel and Fire Emblem-y RPG battles on grids. And it&#x27;s by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there&#x27;s one thing that really gets me going, it&#x27;s a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

                              <span>There is very little in this world that would get between me and playing an RPG made by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, double for one with a soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form. Have a trailer.

                              <span>Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993&#x27;s Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It&#x27;s a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don&#x27;t talk about their sacrifices enough. It&#x27;s out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020&#x27;s Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I&#x27;ve got a trailer&#x27;s worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

Ace Attorney Investigations Collection comprises two games: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit. Neither game has been on PC before, and the latter has never been released outside of Japan.

                              <span>Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.
Each is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. &quot;Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he&#x27;s already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,&quot; notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. &quot;So he&#x27;s kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.&quot;

Even a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn&#x27;t realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It&#x27;s about co-ordinating all your pieces so they&#x27;ll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don&#x27;t organise its parts. It is… a lot. It&#x27;s too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the &quot;themes or core elements&quot; of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a &quot;short-term way&quot;, by the experience of having a daughter.

                              <span>I&#x27;d been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, &quot;It&#x27;s hefty, but I think that&#x27;s probably pushing it&quot;.
I was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game&#x27;s Lands Between, but it&#x27;s knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring&#x27;s finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest 2024 has formally ended, we&#x27;ve spent a couple of weeks gorging upon demos of all stripes, from oil spill clean-up to dancefloor kendo, and now comes the all-important process of deciding which of those demos Won. Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn&#x27;t that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there&#x27;s a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.

I normally wouldn’t let such an opaque stub of a description survive outside of a quick Trello reminder to write something better later, but I’m currently finding it fulfilling enough just to gaze upon that title and consider the fully formed art object that may soon emerge from its tantalising promises. Ok, so the visual component helps too. Orientate yourself by means of the trailer below, and let’s dig into this brazen nose-hooker of a head turner of a game that does exist, about another game that doesn’t.

With those words and the above image, it is possible I have sent a shocking dose of neurochemical nostalgia through your brain and into your various internal organs. Your vision blurs. You sweat. You are 12 years old again, frightened and intrigued at the idea of graduating to teenhood, bathing in the cool glow of a cream-coloured CRT computer monitor. &quot;Habbo Hotel is back!&quot; is what I might shout if I did not know better, snapping you back to the present day in an act of psychological whiplash. The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel. But the Hotel did not forget about you.
Today, developers Sulake are doing something to jog your memory. They are calling it Habbo Hotel: Origins. I ask you to think carefully before you go there.

                              <span>Edwin backstory fragment #345: the greatest usage to which I have ever put my failing grasp of mathematics is determining how many different RPGs I could buy using the &quot;same&quot; money, by dint of trading them in promptly at Gamestation for carefully calculated diminishing returns. I&#x27;d save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money&#x27;s worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.
This was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I&#x27;d eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I &amp; II HD Remaster. I can&#x27;t remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.

The news of the game’s cancellation came last night through a forum post, with Paradox deputy CEO Mattias Lilja painting a picture of a game still too “lacking” for more development time to fix. This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From Dragon Age: Origins&#x27; real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II&#x27;s mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn&#x27;t quite defined the franchise&#x27;s combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series&#x27; origins, I feel it&#x27;s found a great (battle)ground …</span>

                              <span>Bloodborne arrived on PS4 in 2015 and immediately became one of the best games of the year, earning a 9.75 out of 10 from Game Informer and even taking home our award for Best PlayStation Exclusive. But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software&#x27;s most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game&#x27;s many fans.

                              <span>Hot off the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.</span>

                              <span>We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you&#x27;ll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it&#x27;s also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it&#x27;s up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players&#x27; first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new &quot;hand-drawn character visuals&quot; for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</span>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.


The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today&#x27;s announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994&#x27;s X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</span>

                              <span>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she&#x27;s become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it&#x27;s up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there&#x27;s no clear indication that it is connected to Link&#x27;s Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create &quot;echoes&quot; of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…</span>

                              <span>We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.


Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro&#x27;s other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.

The long-awaited Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake appeared during today&#x27;s highly anticipated Nintendo Direct. We learned much more about the upcoming game, including its release date, which falls in November. On top of that, during Summer Game Fest 2024, we spent about 45 minutes checking out the upcoming retro remake of one of the most beloved and important Dragon Quest games of all time.
In Dragon Quest III, which takes place years prior to the first two games in the series, you step into the shoes of the only child of Ortega, a great hero who fail…</span>

The new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.
The new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.

Mystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth&#x27;s greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.
You can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. 
Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.
Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you&#x27;ve already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian&#x27;s ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.
Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</span>

This is the first new entry (there were some remakes a few years ago) in nine years. The game is subtitled Brothership and is apparently a &quot;seafaring adventure&quot; that will include new evolved &quot;Bros moves&quot;.


The game is coming to Nintendo Switch November 7. A big question mark that remains is who is the developer? The series was created by and developed by AlphaDream, but the studio closed down in 2019.</span>

Following up Elden Ring is a gargantuan task. It’s one of my favorite games of all time, and the base adventure isn’t lacking for content, intrigue, or surprises. Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t outclass the primary campaign but expands it, adding a fun and fascinating new zone in the Realm of Shadow. With entertaining new dungeons, a challenging fresh slate of bosses, and a smart new form of progression, Shadow of the Erdtree gives Elden Ring fans more of everything that worked in the main game and is a fan…</span>

                              <span>Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars&#x27; Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming&#x27;s past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.
Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company&#x27;s past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.
Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.</span>

                              <span>Developer Playground Games has announced its next wave of Forza Horizon 5 content will be focused on newer innovations in the realm of automobiles. This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.
The Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park&#x27;s 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park&#x27;s logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.
We absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.</span>

While not all blocking requests were honored, this is the first &#x27;dynamic&#x27; order, allowing the targeted domains to be updated.

                              <span>Elden Ring fans are likely counting down the seconds until the release of its hotly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion this Friday. For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.
In an X post, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion&#x27;s content online. The message reads:
Despite this reasonable request, if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers and don&#x27;t plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you&#x27;ll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe. 
But if you don&#x27;t care about getting a small taste of what Shadow of the Erdtree entails, you can check out our recent hands-on preview or watch us tour a slice of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Monster Hunter is known for its protagonists overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds in their pursuit of taking down the massive monsters that populate the region, but with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom may be taking it to a whole new level. While at Summer Game Fest Play Days, I took in an extended gameplay demo involving an Alpha Monster hunt. I left the demo excited to dive into this seemingly improved take on what the very popular Monster Hunter World delivered in 2018.
Monster Hunter World served as Capcom&#x27;s big push into making a more mainstream and globally appealing entry in the franchise. The team work…</span>

                              <span>Embracer has shut down Pieces Interactive, the developer of the Alone in the Dark reimagining that arrived earlier this year. The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. 
Pieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: 
Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. 


Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced its previously confirmed summer Direct will air tomorrow, June 18. The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.
The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.
Join us for a #NintendoDirect livestream focused on #NintendoSwitch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.

With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company&#x27;s fall calendar currently only has Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it&#x27;s likely this Direct will fill in those gaps. 
With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our 2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule.</span>

                              <span>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.
The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. 


Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they&#x27;re quite loud, you see). 
Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. 
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of Dead Space’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.

                              <span>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not that one. This one. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of exactly the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.

                              <span>Fumes has starred in a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.
It&#x27;s an open world combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.

                              <span>Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss&#x27; office for a severe dressing-down. It&#x27;s a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors&#x27; performances are so spot-on, that it&#x27;d feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.

Grab your shovel and prepare to dig for the trailer, then look foolish as you realise it’s directly below this paragraph.

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare&#x27;s Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which &quot;only&quot; allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014&#x27;s Dragon Age: Inquisition. It&#x27;s another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more &quot;intimate&quot;, and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&amp;A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.

                              <span>This once verdant ground is now wrecked by the passage of time. My terrible nemesis looms before me, inevitable and devastating. Many have fallen to it, but I will overcome. Oh, Elden Ring? I was talking about male pattern baldness. It will eventually destroy all that was once beautiful about my hairline, but at least I’ll have five fancy new hairdos to pick from when the open world RPG’s newest free update releases this Thursday, 20th of June.

                              <span>Beloved friends, hated enemies - last week, we let the side down. Due to a shortage of hands at the pump and persistent clouds of Geoff Keighley activity, there was no weekly Maw liveblog, and this has bred disaster. Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself.

                              <span>Less than six months ago, manga reader app Tachiyomi was forced to call it quits following legal threats from South Korean publisher Kakao. A popular project fork, Aniyomi, introduced anime into the mix, accessed using extensions from the app&#x27;s 200+ strong library. A single DMCA notice from Sony Pictures has now taken all but three extensions offline.

                              <span>Hello reader who is also a reader, and welcome back to Booked For The Week - our regular Sunday chat with a selection of cool industry folks about books!

My sink is ‘non-standard’ apparently. &quot;Why can&#x27;t I just be normal?!&quot; I scream in silent longing. Armitage Shanks would never.

                              <span>You may notice there&#x27;s a stowaway this week. He crept in during all the recent kerfuffle, and secreted himself in a cosy little nook of the treehouse. He was quickly discovered, but despite patient attempts to explain that it&#x27;s  been several years since he was last here, and as per tradition he&#x27;s now dead to us, we&#x27;ve so far been unable to dislodge him. Like the smiley face hidden in the above image, he&#x27;s just... there. So I decided, hell, let&#x27;s hear what he&#x27;s playing this weekend as well.
Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

                              <span>A remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics, the grid-based strategy spin-off from the RPG series that easily ranks as one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made, is reportedly in the works - giving hope of its first official PC release.

                              <span>Look, everyone wants to play Bloodborne on PC. It’s one of those universally accepted truths, like gravity or pizza being delicious. And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing every other PlayStation exclusive to PC, just to mock us. It’s one of those universally accepted unknowns, like how gravity works or the actual best pizza topping. (It’s glue, if you believe AI.)

                              <span>Every so often in the ignoble craft of james gournalism you stumble on a game that reminds you why you got into this weird and silly trade, a game that slices through the phantasmagorical mulch of a million Summer Game Fest announcements and clears the portals of the brain. It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today&#x27;s idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I&#x27;ve had a tonne of fun with, when&#x27;s the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It&#x27;s a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year&#x27;s Keighleycon, and it&#x27;s one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it&#x27;s out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so&#x27;s time.
