Plenty of great first-person shooters take players on globe-trotting adventures using modern military technology, to World Wars, and sometimes the moon or even hell. Immortals of Aveum carves out its own place in the broad genre of shooters by setting its first-person action in the fantasy realm of Aveum, and it’s refreshing to shoot at ax-wielding knights, magic sorcerers, dragons, and more. 
It helps that Immortals of Aveum mixes up its competent shooting with unique, puzzle-like twists to keep most encounters fresh and ex…</span>

                              <span>A challenge: hold your arm at a right angle to your torso, bent at the elbow so you can see your wrist and hand in the corner of your eye. Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.
Despite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it&#x27;s great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it&#x27;s let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.

                              <span>Innocn isn&#x27;t a brand that most people have heard of, but this Chinese firm has been pumping out surprisingly well-reviewed monitors for some time now, often hitting niches more well-known companies haven&#x27;t reached while being extremely aggressive on price. That&#x27;s a winning combination for models backed by positive critical reviews, and today we spotted a deal on perhaps their best monitor yet - the Innocn 27M2V, a 27-inch 4K 160Hz monitor with a Mini LED backlight and HDMI 2.1 ports, providing an extremely good HDR experience and full compatibility with PS5, Xbox Series X and PC.

In case you missed it, Nintendo has announced Charles Martinet - the legendary voice of Mario - is &quot;stepping back from recording&quot; and will instead take up the new role of Mario Ambassador.
Following this news, it was confirmed Martinet would not be voicing the iconic video game mascot in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and now it&#x27;s also been confirmed he won&#x27;t be voicing his arch-rival Wario in the upcoming title WarioWare: Move It!, due out on Switch this November.

Ahead of the digital launch of the retro-inspired RPG Sea of Stars, physical distributor &#x27;iam8bit&#x27; and Sabotage Studio have announced a hard copy version is coming to the Nintendo Switch. The catch is you&#x27;re going to have to hold out until next year.

There haven&#x27;t been any other details about this physical version revealed just yet, but you can sign up to the &#x27;iam8bit&#x27; newsletter for updates.

What I do know, is there&#x27;s a Vampire Survivors-like called HoloCure: Save The Fans that&#x27;s entirely fan made, entirely free, and revolves around Hololive, a VTuber agency replete with catgirls. I am taken aback by how good it is.

                              <span>Calling a spaceship The Invincible might seem like an initially hopeful idea, but boy oh boy, does it open the door to some ironic and probably deadly occurrences. We’ll see just how lucky the ship is when The Invincible comes out on its newly-revealed release date, November 6th, though some readers may know how this story ends already, since it&#x27;s based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 science fiction novel of the same name.

                              <span>When listing off my favourite games, I&#x27;m shamefully likely to neglect to mention Firewatch. This is probably because Firewatch isn&#x27;t a game that had some huge formative impact on me, or reframed my entire relationship with gaming, or became an enduring obsession of my hyperfixation-prone brain. Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.
I think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who&#x27;s often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn&#x27;t provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I&#x27;d like, I&#x27;ll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong: Firewatch&#x27;s central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch&#x27;s enduring appeal.

                              <span>Despite my best efforts, I’m still not proficient at wall-running or motorbiking. But lucky for me, publishers 505 Games have announced that Ghostrunner 2 is coming out on October 26th, which is shaping up to be another very busy month for very good-looking games. The original Ghostrunner bashed the first-person parkour of Mirror’s Edge with cyberpunky ninja swords to great success, and the sequel bolts on a rideable bike and a parry system to the winning formula.

Life By You and Paralives both have grand plans to unseat (or at least share it with) EA’s life sim juggernaut, and they both promise to set themselves apart with features that Simmers have long been asking for. But I only have one question for both of them: can I kill my Sims? Or Parafolk? Or… Lifers? In the case of Paralives, the answer is thankfully a big fat yes.

                              <span>Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. 


“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We&#x27;ve also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.


The update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to know where to start with Six Ages 2 Colon Lights Going Out. The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series&#x27; biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) &quot;lore&quot;, it&#x27;s a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.
It&#x27;s harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?

These two franchises have certainly enjoyed a good relationship up to this point. After all, Super Bomberman R Online had already crossed over with Fall Guys in 2021. What makes this one a bit interesting, though, is that Super Bomberman R 2 will have the… guy from Fall Guys shortly after launch. It’ll arrive on September 14, to be specific. Called the “Bean Bomber” here, you’ll be able to unlock the little fellow from the title’s in-game store.
The Bean will join a few other cameo characters that were previously pointed out by Destructoid’s own Zoey “corn chips are no place for a mighty warrior” Handley. These include the likes of Dracula and Princess Tomato, making Super Bomberman R 2 something of a crossover fest. Considering it’s hard to tell when and if we’ll ever see a lot of these classic Konami characters, I&#x27;ll welcome these small cameos when I can.
Super Bomberman R 2 will launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 13. Those with physical copies can play the game a day earlier on September 12.

                              <span>I have an unhealthy fascination with advergames. Well, advertising in general, but advertising has gotten so boring since we started expecting companies to tell the truth and not try to kill us too blatantly. Advertising games in general aren’t super common anymore, usually relegated to browser or mobile platforms.
It’s not that I expect them to be good. Outside of a few exceptions, they’re usually not. At the very best, they’re inoffensive, but at worst, we have Mr. Pibb. Otherwise known as Mr. Pibb: The 3D Interactive Game. It might potentially be the worst first-person shooter I’ve ever played, but to truly confirm that, I’d have to delve through the fog of repressed trauma, and I don’t think it’s worth it.

                              <span>I remember when Mortal Kombat launched in 1992, or rather, I remember when it was ported to consoles in 1993. I was six at the time, but it was impossible to avoid the media fervor around its ultra-violence. My parents didn’t bat an eye when I rented it. My mother’s reaction to seeing me play it was to just ask if it was that game everyone was talking about. Then she continued with her day.
That would normally be an extremely weak way to start talking about Mortal Kombat 1. The original Mortal Kombat (which we can no longer refer to as Mortal Kombat 1) was 11 Mortal Kombats ago.
Yet Mortal Kombat 1 seems somewhat keen to tap into nostalgia for the ‘90s, and there’s nothing I have more abundance of than ‘90s nostalgia. It seems aimed at lapsed fans and dilettantes like myself. Through the K…</span>

                              <span>When I saw that Honkai: Star Rail was having a special collaboration event with Sunright Tea Studio, I was intrigued. Most HoYoverse collabs in the past have been exclusive to locations in Asia, so it’s a rare occasion for one of these to happen in the United States. On top of that, there happened to be a Sunright about 15 minutes away from me, so I decided to check it out.
The event officially began on July 19, and my brother happened to be in the area, so we paid a visit that evening. I wasn’t expecting too much of a crowd since, well, how many passionate anime gacha game lovers could there be in my little city?
Turns out, quite a few. The place was bright and bustling. A sports car wrapped in anime girl vinyl sat proudly outside. The store itself was full of boba enjoyers posing with ca…</span>

                              <span>We got word of a sequel to cyberpunk hack-and-slasher Ghostrunner back in May 2021, and now we have a date. 505 Games set Ghostrunner 2 up as another drop in a jam-packed bucket on October 26, 2023. 
Along with the news came a new trailer for the first-person followup, which continues the story of Jack, a veritable cyber ninja who was thought to be one of the last active Ghostrunners. The new gamescom story trailer dips its toes into what&#x27;s new this time around. This includes a quick look at the absurdly fast motorcyle and some of the vehicular combat that comes along with it. There&#x27;s also a nasty AI cult to contend with, which doesn&#x27;t sound too divorced from reality.
Ghostrunner 2 features a totally revamped progression system, with new abilities and paths available. According to 505, the sequel hopes to be more approachable to both new and experienced players alike. There&#x27;s also a new block and perfect parry system, for those who pride themselves on their flashy CQC skills. It sounds like there&#x27;s more freedom in the encounters and exploration, too, particularly when it comes to taking on bosses.

Rev &#x27;em up
Those looking to pick up Ghostrunner 2 when it launches can dig through a few pre-order options. The $39.99 Base Edition is both physical and digital, and the $49.99 Deluxe Edition and $69.99 Brutal Edition are digital. Picking up the Brutal Edition grants access to the sequel two days early on October 24. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass with a new mode and four asset packs, a bonus animated skin and a motorcycle skin. If there&#x27;s a way to make my motorcycle look as ridiculous as possible, count me in. 
Ghostrunner 2 will dash to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC when it launches on October 26.

There are 20 milestones in total that you can strive for with each one unlocking new rewards. Unlocking a milestone will earn you some cash as well as some expansion permits and development points.
Expansion permits allow you to add new tiles to add to your city, expanding the bounds in which you can build your metropolis. You can also use expansion permits to check out the exact resource and quality aspects of a prospective tile.

                              <span>After a long period of rumors followed by an official announcement, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is finally nearing launch. Ubisoft&#x27;s next installment takes place in 9th-century Baghdad, with Basim Ibn Ishaq taking center stage. Mirage is said to return to the Assassin’s Creed series roots, embracing stealth and parkour.
As the case with past Assassin’s Creed games, Mirage features historical locations and figures that complement more fantastical aspects of its story. In the latest developer behind-the-scenes, the Mirage team discussed the meticulous details and research that went into making Mirage. It&#x27;s all in an effort to deliver a more authentic recreation of Baghdad—one that doesn’t fall victim to common tropes and cliches.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is quickly approaching its upcoming November launch. While its respective gameplay changes are fairly interesting in their own right - namely the 50% health increase, the point-shooting feature, and customizable Operators - some may have come across a curious leak. This leak included, among other things, what appeared to be a full and comprehensive list of the game&#x27;s weaponry, with guns both returning and all-new. The list was so surprising, in fact, that it would&#x27;ve been all-too-easy to write it off as fan fiction or a wishlist.
Some recent developments, however, make it plainly evident that the list may be correct. Or, in a worst-case scenario, partially correct, as some of Activision&#x27;s latest Modern Warfare 3 promo materials prominently feature the guns fr…</span>

                              <span>There were previous reports that Lenovo may be preparing to release a handheld PC gaming device that will compete with the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally. A recent article from Windows Report goes more in-depth regarding the rumored handheld device, while also revealing that there could be AR goggles to accompany it.
According to Windows Report, the glasses are part of a gaming ecosystem being developed by Lenovo. No release date or price is given for the handheld or the glasses, and Lenovo has yet to confirm or deny the reports.

                              <span>Destiny 2&#x27;s Season 22 is launching on August 22, and the community has some admittedly sensible expectations for some of its key content. Namely, one of Destiny&#x27;s most important features has always been its trademark Bungie gunplay, which naturally ties into the game&#x27;s weaponry. One of the reasons why Destiny 2: Lightfall missed its mark was because the DLC&#x27;s main weapon set consisted of slightly remodeled and re-skinned Shadowkeep weapons, leaving a bad taste for some players.
Granted, Lightfall had way bigger problems than just reskinned guns, and those too are allegedly going to start being addressed as of Season 22, according to Joe Blackburn himself. In the time interim, with just hours to go before Bungie reveals Season 22 proper, the community has explained precisely what it wants a…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that the longtime voice actor of many iconic Mario characters is stepping back from the role. In a Tweet today, they made the announcement that Charles Martinet is instead moving into the role of “Mario Ambassador.”
Charles Martinet has been in the role of Mario since 1994’s CD-ROM version of Mario Teaches Typing. Beyond the red-shirted plumber, he also went on to voice just about every other male character in the Mushroom Kingdom, including Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi. However, the recent Super Mario Bros. Movie cast Chris Pratt in the role, and trailers for Super Mario Wonder had many people questioning if Martinet had been replaced. That’s still kind of up in the air.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1693624002982314108?s&#x3D;20
The post made by Nintendo doesn’t address the reasons for Martinet stepping back. However, it says that he will continue to travel to promote the character. They plan to follow up with a video featuring Charles Martinet and Shigeru Miyamoto, which will hopefully provide more information.
It’s a bit of a curious thing. Mario hasn’t been the most vocal character, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that jarring to have another actor in the role. However, Martinet has been almost inseparable from the character for a long while now and had previously stated in 2021, “I want to voice Mario until I drop dead.” Really, I’m just hoping that agreeable circumstances led to him leaving the role.
I also hope Nintendo isn’t planning on taking Mario games into a more dialogue-reliant direction, but that’s a personal preference.
Nintendo did not state if Martinet will still be playing his roles in upcoming games, such as the Super Mario RPG remake or Super Mario Bros. Wonder. More information is forthcoming.

                              <span>Resident Evil 4 received a remake in March 2023 which brought Leon’s classic adventure to modern consoles. As was the case with Resident Evil 7 and Village, Capcom has promised a VR mode for the remake. We’ll get to see a little more of the VR mode at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, which kicks off on September 21 and runs until September 24.
Resident Evil 4 isn’t the only Capcom game that’ll be making an appearance. The company also lists Street Fighter 6, Exoprimal, Monster Hunter Now, and the Ace Attorney trilogy on its official webpage outlining its Tokyo Game Show plans.

Capcom has big plans for the Tokyo Game Show 2023
Capcom will have its own booth at the Tokyo Game Show where attendees will have the chance to try out some of the company’s latest games. The event will also feature the return of the Resident Evil airsoft shooting range in collaboration with Tokyo Marui. For those who can’t make it, there’ll be a prerecorded stream which’ll share some of Capcom’s biggest news. It airs on September 21 at 07:00 AM PDT.
We received our first teaser for Resident Evil 4’s VR mode during the May PlayStation showcase, though not much was revealed. We&#x27;ll hopefully see a few more details this time around, including whether game modes outside of the main campaign will also receive the VR treatment.
The company will have to put on a good show if it hopes to stand out, as several other gaming giants have confirmed that they’ll be showing up, including Bandai Namco and Square Enix. Sony will also be there, though they’ll only be exhibiting indie titles.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield is one of the most hotly anticipated titles of 2023, which is a heck of an achievement for a year that&#x27;s already played host to heavy hitters like Hogwarts Legacy, Resident Evil 4, and Diablo 4, to list a few. It&#x27;s easy to see the appeal, too, as the game&#x27;s been described as &quot;Skyrim in space&quot; by Todd Howard himself. It&#x27;s a given, of course, that not everyone will find themselves enjoying what appears to be a classic Bethesda Game Studios RPG, but some may have taken their biases a tad too far.
In fact, some early critique coming from a particular game developer has drawn the ire of Bethesda Game Studios&#x27; own Head of Publishing, Pete Hines. Certainly, there&#x27;s room for critique in every project - especially one as large and substantial as Starfield appears to be. Whether…</span>

                              <span>Gran Turismo is a Neill Blomkamp-directed film based on the popular PlayStation franchise. It tells the tracks the tale of how Jann Mardenborough turned his love of Gran Turismo games into a fully-fledged motorsport career. Though the wide release for the USA is set for August 25, the film has aired in international markets, reception has been good thus far, and it has been reported that the film has already grossed $22.7 million.

Gran Turismo racing to theatres
The Gran Turismo movie is a star-studded affair featuring Archie Madekwe as Mardenborough, Djimon Hounsou as Mardenborough’s father, and Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore. As Blomkamp has explained, to capture the most cinematic shots, filmographers used FPV drones to carry IMAX sensor-approved cameras. Several cockpit shots were used which will be familiar to franchise fans.

Critical reception to the Gran Turismo movie has been positive overall, which reviewers complimenting the film’s authenticity and sincerity. It has not managed to avoid all criticism, and there has been some controversy regarding the film&#x27;s depiction of Mardenborough’s Nürburgring crash which led to the death of a spectator. Some have described it as insensitive, with Polygon calling it “a tasteless reframing of a fatal event.”
Gran Turismo’s road to theatres has featured a few obstacles. Most notably, it has had to contend with the SAG-AFTRA strike which has affected all of Hollywood. As a result, the movie had its August 11 release date delayed in the USA.
The Gran Turismo movie is but one of several video game adaptations Sony has in store. A Ghost of Tsushima movie is in the works, and fans can also look forward to television adaptations of the Horizon and God of War franchises.

                              <span>Update: The collab was teased last week.
Update : Devolver Digital has stopped teasing us, and has officially revealed — and dropped — a brand new crossover for Cult of the Lamb with Don&#x27;t Starve Together.
This brand new update, to celebrate Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s first anniversary, adds a new Pentinence Mode. Your little Lamb will need to eat and sleep to survive along with its followers. There&#x27;s also the Webber, a new follower who can never die of starvation.

                              <span>Pokémon came home.
After the Pokémon World Championships made its long-awaited return in London last year, it was announced that the 2023 Championships would be taking place at the Pacifico Yokohama in Japan.
This would be only the second time the tournament has been held outside of North America, making this truly a monumental announcement — somehow, even with Pokémon being huge in Japan, the Championship Series had never been held there. Many felt that this was truly going to be something special. The question is, did the 2023 World Championships live up to the hype?

Nintendo told both publications that &quot;... while Charles is not involved in the game, we&#x27;re excited to honour his legacy and contributions, including looking ahead to what he&#x27;ll be doing as a Mario Ambassador...

                              <span>California dreaming.
2D sports titles have had their place since Konami’s Track &amp; Field rattled arcade screws loose with its fiercely competitive button rapping. WayForward’s Xtreme Sports draws influence from California Games, a summery seaside boardwalk of hip events and addictive tap-a-thons. You have two characters to choose from, dude or girlfriend dudette, who face off in various tricky sporting events that scream early &#x27;00s gnarlyness.
Xtreme Sports, originally a 2000 Game Boy Color title, was graphically impressive for Nintendo’s colour handheld, and the portrait and character art will be familiar to anyone ingratiated with WayForward’s pirate platformer, Shantae. The visuals are bold, colourful, and cleanly arranged, each minigame functioning well around a two-button control scheme. As well as a piecemeal practice mode, the story game features an island over-world with various NPCs who shape your bid for podium gold, and energy drinks that offer a competitive advantage. To enter the tournament proper where the challenge is increased, you first need to complete the training rounds. There are five events to tackle: skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, surfing, and skyboarding.

It&#x27;s not got a firm release date yet, but the beat-em-up looks very reminiscent of Nintendo&#x27;s classic franchise from the NES, SNES, and Wii. You&#x27;ll be taking to the ring to experience &quot;adrenaline-pumping action&quot; with some really impressive HD animation and effects.

The latest is relatively minor, but there are a few things here that should make for a more pleasing experience for fans. So without any further waffle, let&#x27;s take a look at what&#x27;s in store for us:

Following the release of Red Dead Redemption on the Switch, Digital Foundry has now provided its full technical analysis of the game to see how it holds up on Nintendo&#x27;s console.
The video states that the Switch version is comfortably more capable than the original 2010 release on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and is at least comparable to the PlayStation 4 version. Regarding resolution, you&#x27;re looking at a native 1080p in docked mode and 720p in handheld mode; about as good as you can hope for on the Switch, then.

                              <span>Not for honour.
We recently got the chance to have a pop at Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1 at the invite of Konami. We had around an hour or so to dig into Metal Gear Solid and its two sequels (as well as have a quick gander at all the bonus content on offer), which isn’t a huge amount of time for games of this scale, but we were able to get a broad idea of how the collection pans out. So, what’s the damage?
We started off with the OG, Metal Gear Solid. We were initially struck with the reality that this really is a warts-and-all kind of port, sticking to the original PS1 version’s low resolution and frame rate. We had a bit of a giddy retro thrill seeing it run as originally intended, but it does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to not take things even further and provide a way to play these games that’s more in line with modern sensibilities.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed new console wraps for the Xbox Series X. 
These wraps work similarly to Sony’s PlayStation 5 console covers, allowing players to change the console’s cosmetic look without buying an entirely new one. Instead of sliding covers off like with the PS5, Xbox’s solution is to wrap the cosmetic change around the console, hence the name. The company has revealed three wraps to kick off the product, including a special edition Starfield wrap. 
“The Starfield-inspired console wrap reimagines your console as an on-board avionics module, powering you through your adventures,” an Xbox blog post reads. “Key internal console components are highlighted through outlined access panel and game-inspired graphics.

Madden NFL 24 from EA Tiburon expands on the rebuilt fundamentals from last year, creating a football simulation that takes a solid next step toward authenticity. However, new poorly implemented features and an interface showing its age are enough of a drag to make this latest iteration feel like a step back for a series badly in need of forward progress.
The on-the-field gameplay is more realistic than ever. The physics-based player interactions are noticeably improved, with ball carriers pushing against piles…</span>

                              <span>The Invincible will be released this November. 
More specifically, publisher 11 bit studios and developer Starward Industries have revealed that its upcoming sci-fi mystery game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: 


In The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.
“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.
Starward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” 

The Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. 
The Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6.

                              <span>Nintendo of America has revealed that Charles Martinet, the longtime voice of Mario in the company’s various Mario games, is stepping back from the role and will no longer record lines for the character. 
Nintendo announced this in a tweet posted today, revealing that Martinet is now moving into “the brand-new role of Mario Ambassador.” While he is stepping back from recording lines for Mario, Nintendo says Martinet will continue to travel the world to interact with fans and share the joy of the character.

Martinet has been the voice of Mario in the mainline games since Super Mario 64 in 1996. That’s more than 25  years as one of the most popular mascots of all time. Nintendo says it will share a special video message from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Martinet at a later date. 
This news is out of left field, as it’s unclear why Martinet will no longer voice the character. Perhaps Nintendo wishes to take the voice in a different direction – it hired Chris Pratt to voice Mario in this year’s massively successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Perhaps Martinet simply wants to move on from the character, although that seems unlikely as he’s now in a new role of Mario Ambassador, according to Nintendo. 
Regardless of why, Martinet’s voice as Mario will be missed. Mario’s next outing, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, hits Switch this October but given today’s news, it’s now unclear if Martinet is the voice of Mario in that game. Game Informer has reached out to Nintendo to ask for confirmation on whether Martinet is the voice of Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder and will update the story if comment is received.

                              <span>Ironwood Studios has delayed Pacific Drive to 2024. 
Initially set to release sometime this year, the team recently announced that it is delaying the game to early 2024, as reported by Eurogamer. As for why, Ironwood Studios says it needs more room to make Pacific Drive the best it can be while also prioritizing the health of everyone on the team. 
As summer comes to a close, we’d like to share that Pacific Drive is moving its release to early 2024.

“As many know, we’ve been hard at work bringing this idea to life for quite some time, and every day adds even more to a game we’re all proud of,” the studio writes on Twitter. “In this final stretch, however, it’s important to us that we stay true to ourselves, and not compromise on the team’s well-being. 
“As our community grows, the support and excitement everyone has shown has been incredible and we can’t wait for everyone to take their own set of wheels out into the Zone. Everyone here at Ironwood truly appreciates your patience and understanding.”
Ironwood Studios says it has a surprise to share this week, as it will be a part of the Future Games Show with a new trailer. 
The team revealed Pacific Drive in 2022, and after checking out a hands-off preview of the survival game last year, we came away excited about its potential. It mixes elements of racing with the survival genre alongside a spooky Pacific Northwest setting that we can’t wait to see more of. You can read our Pacific Drive preview thoughts here.

                              <span>In May five men behind pirate IPTV service Flawless TV were sentenced to more than 30 years in prison following a Premier League prosecution. Fugitive Zak Smith was detained in Thailand last month and now faces sentencing back in the UK. Photographs of his arrest have been circulating in Thailand along with an allegation of Smith selling IPTV from a rented home.

Discontinued after less than a year on the market and never released in Europe, the elusive red-and-black headset is remembered as a headache-inducing, seemingly epic misfire from legendary Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi.
Nonetheless, a small but passionate community of engineers and developers is working to keep the Virtual Boy alive nearly three decades on from its premature and unfortunate demise. Their wares, which include high-quality after-market hardware and commercially successful small-batch physical copies of newly developed games, are a sign of sustained interest in the system.

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
In last week&#x27;s battle, we took a look at Pokémon Stadium for the N64, pitting Europe and North America against Japan. It was a fairly close match, but Japan just about managed to take the crown with 58% of the vote.

                              <span>If someone were to write the history of internet video, I think they&#x27;d need to mention Killer Bean. Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.

Now it&#x27;s getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it&#x27;s an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There&#x27;s a first trailer below.

Following a successful launch in June and even some DLC, Spike Chunsoft has now released another minor update for the noir detective adventure game Master Detective Archives: Rain Code.

It&#x27;s Saturday and you know what that means. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s time for a spot of the ol&#x27; gaming.
There have been a good number of highlights at Nintendo Life this week. We got a large helping of Splatoon 3 news as we received a first look at the upcoming Drizzle Season and new Deep Cut amiibo — we&#x27;re still in love with Big Man.

                              <span>Over the past month I&#x27;ve been delivering a number of Linux laptop tests with the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U for that Zen 4 &quot;Phoenix&quot; SoC within an Acer Swift Edge 16. One of the requests that has come up with my ongoing testing has been how well the default Microsoft Windows 11 installation compares to loading up Linux on this 8-core AMD Zen 4 laptop. Well, in this article is a look at the Linux performance compared to Windows 11, including when making use of the Linux 6.5 development kernel where AMD P-State is now the default and also for seeing what workloads are impacted by the recent AMD Inception vulnerability.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo is hardly the worst company when it comes to localizing their games, but considering how many great titles they have, any single game that an audience doesn’t get is a real blow.
Leaving a game unlocalized wasn’t very common in the early days when there was less text in games. Mostly we missed out on games like Famicom Detective Club and Fire Emblem, both titles that eventually received translations and re-releases. Mainly, the number of unlocalized titles bloated out in the early 3D era, then retracted again once we hit HD and the world became better connected through the internet.
However, there are still a number of titles that Nintendo has yet to localize, and I would like to bring them to your attention. Maybe we just need to make a bit of noise, and we’ll finally get to see …</span>

We&#x27;re still a few months away from seeing the eighth mainline entry in the Like a Dragon series. Fortunately, it won&#x27;t be long before players meet Kazuma Kiryu again in the spinoff, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. That&#x27;s right, Kiryu did such a thorough job erasing his name that he goes by the unsuspecting name of &quot;Joryu&quot;. All the while, he&#x27;ll find himself once again embroiled in threats, violence, and underworld intrigue. But those who manage to endure these trials will get treated to a Special Trial Version of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hardly a secret that Destiny 2 and Bungie are in a bit of a pickle right now. Most years, the big &quot;State of the Game&quot; blogs used to signal big batches of positive changes coming to the game with the next paid DLC. This did not happen this time around. Instead, the community raised pitchforks after Bungie clarified that, no, there wasn&#x27;t a big PvP content drop on the horizon. And no, there was no yearly ritual armor refresh because the team was too busy working on microtransaction armor.
The release of 2023&#x27;s Lightfall DLC already soured things for a non-insignificant number of players. The game became more expensive to play on top of failing to reach the heights of 2022&#x27;s Witch Queen expansion.

                              <span>Activision has made it clear that it&#x27;s got some big plans for the November release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. However, one particularly interesting tidbit of related information comes from the recent pre-order announcement. Featuring an admittedly substantial selection of skins, weaponry, and additional Season 1 goodies, the special Vault edition of MW3 also signals the grand return of the Weapon Vault system. Which was, by all accounts, seemingly forgotten for an entire year now.
Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Carry Forward functionality means that Modern Warfare 2 players can effortlessly transition over to the new title with all of their gear and cosmetics included. This is good news, broadly speaking, even if it will inevitably complicate the new title&#x27;s meta and balancing. But this is als…</span>

In fact, the new patch 3.22 season titled Path of Exile: Trial of the Ancestors releases tomorrow, August 18, on PC and Mac. Console players will get the new season launch a week later on August 23.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide was one of my most anticipated games of 2022. I couldn’t wait to play Fatshark’s first-person shooter evolution of the rat-infested melee frenzy that was Vermintide 2. Unfortunately, it had its fair share of issues at launch, from performance frustrations on PC to a lackluster progression…

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s A750 and A770 graphics cards tend to be great value, but have a few gaping holes when it comes to performance in older graphics APIs like DirectX 9 and DirectX 11. That&#x27;s slowly changing though - in fact, the company announced significant frame-rate improvements in DX11 titles today - while price drops continue to bring these GPUs into an even more favourable price/performance window. One case is the Arc A770 16GB, which is now available from Newegg for just $300, down from their regular US MSRP of $330.

I&#x27;m playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn&#x27;t know what causes it, and he doesn&#x27;t know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it&#x27;s been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren&#x27;t safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.
I thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you&#x27;d normally get as a murderer), but I&#x27;ve also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here&#x27;s to more of them.

You&#x27;re a very young officer of... something, battlefield promoted to captaincy of the Fathership, essentially a giant floating base from which you set out on your airship in an open world kinda way to trade broadsides with baddies and land at occupied islands to do the twin stick shooter thing on foot. I… don’t like it as much as I want to.

                              <span>Hello everybody! This is Edwin, your resident news-wrangler. I&#x27;ve been in this glorious job for a whole two weeks now, and alas it is time to say goodbye... because I&#x27;m off on holiday. Genius-level journostrategist that I am, I managed to book a week away walking in Scotland during Gamescom before landing the gig, and I can&#x27;t rebook without incurring the everlasting hatred of Caledonian Sleeper. I do have a few under-embargo stories and a review going live next week, but beyond that I&#x27;ll be up a mountain somewhere until 29th August. Apologies - if you&#x27;re up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I&#x27;ll try to bellow something about Starfield.


Before I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole &quot;news&quot; concept that&#x27;s doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I&#x27;ve tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday&#x27;s musings about pacifism - but I&#x27;ve mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.

                              <span>A single GTA 5 mod has rekindled the age-old shouting match about the precise legality and contribution of videogame mods, in the eyes of developers, publishers and players - while also threatening to trigger fresh debate on the use of large language models, aka AI, in game development. The mod in question, &quot;AI Powered GTA V: Story Mode with AI NPCs&quot; sees you investigating a cult of weirdo AI worshippers, with characters who speak AI-generated dialogue. It&#x27;s now been struck from several sites by GTA 5 publisher Take-Two Interactive.

                              <span>The characters in what we might term the Aperture Cinematic Universe are a memorable bunch (as I have said before). Though GLaDOS rightfully tops the list another, introduced in 2011&#x27;s sequel spectacular Portal 2, became an instant favourite. Voiced by J.K. Simmons, doing a turn adjacent to his J. J. Jameson from Spider-Man, Cave Johnson is the founder of Aperture Science (which used to primarily make shower curtains before it evolved into being a death trap puzzle company), and he made an instant impression. And though Aperture Desk Job is nominally a tech demo for the Steam Deck, it also expands the Cave Johnson lore in a very satisfying way. Spoilers beyond for Aperture Desk Job, and Portal 2 if you haven&#x27;t played it.

                              <span>The Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 modding scene remains dominated by blunt practicalities - more XP! More spellslots! More party members! HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING! - but there are a few intriguing mods percolating to the top. We&#x27;ve already had one that makes Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 a single character RPG, which I am hoping somebody at the RPS Treehouse will do a diary feature about, plus a Painterly Scenery filter created by 1wk, which makes the game look like it&#x27;s daubed on canvas. But the cluster of mods that caught my eye this morning are a simple change of camera perspective and controls that make the game look strikingly like Bioware&#x27;s Dragon Age: Origins.

I do a bit of bow, a bit of sword, a bit of plucking the lute and buffing my pals with a nice song. My greatest strength, though, lies outside of combat in the arena known as &quot;conversation&quot;. Seriously, I&#x27;ve played for around 30 hours now and haven&#x27;t lost a single chat skillcheck. At first I loved being a master of chats, but ever since I played some co-op with my pals using a less charismatic dude, I&#x27;ve found Edders Sheeran&#x27;s unbeatable gob a bit… deflating?

                              <span>This week on All Things Nintendo, Brian renders his final verdict on Blasphemous 2, the new challenging Metroidvania that takes inspiration from games like Dead Cells and Dark Souls. After that, we have two interviews with folks who are involved with the music of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, but in very different ways. First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she&#x27;s also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. He also happens to be the composer for the upcoming Sonic Superstars.

                              <span>Last month I visited Sonic Team&#x27;s new headquarters in Burbank, CA, alongside Game Informer&#x27;s Brian Shea, who&#x27;s now played half of Sonic Superstars. The upcoming 2D platformer brings Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy back for a new cooperative adventure — however, I&#x27;d like to note we only engaged with the single-player experience. After our several-hour hands-on play session, we sat in my hotel room to break down our time playing six of Superstars&#x27; 12 zones, including details about each level, boss fights, the signature Emerald Powers, and how the platforming physics behaved.

After a strange, but funny tease and an official teaser trailer earlier this month, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3) is been fully unveiled with a full trailer, new details, and a handful of screenshots, which you can find below.


Expectedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&#x27;s campaign picks up where Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II left off. Modern Warfare III will also include what Activision is calling an, &quot;open world Zombies set on the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever.&quot; It is also promising a big collection of fan favorite and brand new multiplayer maps. You can check out screens from the campaign in the gallery below.

Before all of that, however, Marcus dives into his recent visit to Universal Studios&#x27;s Minion Land and his sampling of the park&#x27;s The Last Of Us-themed menu featuring a delicious pasta dish titled &quot;Left Behind Ravioli.&quot;

We have just a few months to go before the NBA tips off in October and the teams are beginning to reveal their schedules for the 2023-24 season. Normally, this news is nothing to do with Nintendo — it&#x27;s just a bunch of sports teams posting images of their filled-in calendars — but the Chicago Bulls have caught our attention this year with their Pokémon-inspired announcement.
Instead of simply revealing the team&#x27;s upcoming dates, the Bulls have published their schedule in the style of Pokémon Red and Blue (check it out above). There&#x27;s no calendar in sight as Benny the Bull (the team mascot) rides a bike around a pixel art Chicago, visiting gyms and challenging any trainers that he comes across. These opponents are other familiar faces from around the league, with Benny &amp; co. facing off against the likes of Victor Wembanyama, Nikola Jokic and Lebron James, all in the style of a classic Pokémon battle.

Updated with new entries. Enjoy!

Few could have predicted just how successful Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console would be prior to launch back in March 2017. For the preceding decade or so, many prolific third-party publishers tended to overlook Nintendo&#x27;s systems for a variety of reasons, but Switch has attracted a huge number of the world&#x27;s premier developers back to Nintendo hardware, some for the first time in a long time.

                              <span>A 30-year-old Dutchman is suspected of being a key player in a multi-million euro pirate IPTV operation, which served over a million subscribers. The defendant asked to be released pending trial but is considered a flight risk, so the request was denied. Tapped conversations suggest that the man planned to restart the pirate IPTV business and flee to Morocco.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was announced a little over a week ago, offering a back-to-back sequel for the first time in Call Of Duty&#x27;s history. Now we have a release date of November 10th and a proper first trailer.

                              <span>In a move that I already know I&#x27;ll live to regret making, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast takes a look at the discourse that flared up in and around the release of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Larian&#x27;s epic RPG had people asking: why aren&#x27;t all games like this? But in an angry tone of voice that we feel left some things out of the conversation. Also, Nate challenges a Times columnist to single MMA combat, and we talk about the games we&#x27;ve been playing this week (spoilers: none of them are Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3!).

                              <span>When I wrote up yesterday&#x27;s big dollop of Starfield info I was expecting readers to focus on the stuff about housing, mechs and giant snake cults, in roughly that order. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a slight stir about the inability to complete the game without killing anyone. &quot;Disappointing&quot;, responded Youtuber Mike BurnFire in the QTs. Opined Mama Bedlam: &quot;A fully pacifist run not existing (without mods) is a genuinely worrying sign to do with the flexibility of what the game can do&quot;. Some players took the news as a brazen provocation. As ManyATrueNerd put it: &quot;CHALLENGE. FUCKING. ACCEPTED.&quot;

                              <span>The brutish &quot;X curio is like Y behemoth&quot; logic of mass entertainment nooze requires me to associate Selkie Harbour&#x27;s The Anglerfish Project with Starfield. They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn&#x27;t have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it&#x27;s a sweet and tidy stargaze &#x27;em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.

                              <span>The rest of the RPS Treehouse might be fully engrossed in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 at the moment, but the main thing that&#x27;s been on my mind for the last couple of weeks is stealthy strategy games. Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme&#x27;s upcoming turn-based tactics &#x27;em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.
Specifically, I&#x27;ve been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League&#x27;s campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I&#x27;m not gonna lie. I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I&#x27;d arrived fresh and green, I don&#x27;t think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is.

                              <span>Hear me now, Penitent Ones, for thou are subject to an intro that borrows its style from thine video game. With divine expedience you must go forth into a world from which all unworthy creatures impart their knowledge with great excitations, entangling their speech with a verbosity comparable only to how the holy miracle does imbue our city with its fearsome illumination. If you think this a questionable affectation then guard thyselves, oh Penitent Ones, for you really are in store for an awful lot of this.  


Beyond that, Blasphemous 2 is a cracking Metroidvania rooted in satisfying combat and rewarding exploration of the ‘ooh, I didn’t realise this bit was connected to that bit’ vein. Neither element is on the same level of Dark Souls, but then what is?

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s vaunted space bonanza Starfield is available for preload today on PC Game Pass - if you&#x27;re downloading it on Steam, you&#x27;ll need to wait a little longer (even longer, if you plan on playing Starfield on Steam Deck). The file weighs in at 139.84 GB, so be sure to clear some disc space before you force this galaxy&#x27;s worth of grey rocks, NASApunks and hopefully extensive Event Horizon comparisons into your protesting PC, which has only ever lived to serve you and bring you joy. Might be an idea to double-check those Starfield system specs, too, and make that final call on whether to invest in a new SSD.

                              <span>Stephen Kick, CEO of Nightdive Studios, has said he&#x27;d love to remaster Epic&#x27;s 90s FPS Unreal. Not familiar with Nightdive? They&#x27;re the team behind this May&#x27;s triumphant System Shock remake, which Jeremy Peel described in his review as &quot;a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design&quot;. They&#x27;re also the studio behind last week&#x27;s surprise-released Quake 2 remaster, and a bunch of other classic 90s remasters including the PC version of DOOM 64 and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It&#x27;s safe to say they know how to pull off a retro (sorry, Kamiya-san) comeback.

                              <span>The season is about to change, and with it, we have some changes to Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga. The game&#x27;s upcoming Legends DLC will launch in time to join the fall playlist, which Freedom Games has showcased in a new trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uSb8BhMJutY
Developer Dancing Dragon Games (Skyborn, Echoes of Aetheria) first entered the battlefield with Symphony of War in June 2022. The title takes inspiration from series like Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle, which has resonated with retro strategy-RPG fans. The Legends DLC was revealed during the 2023 Guerrilla Collective showcase, just shy of the game&#x27;s one year anniversary. This update promises to deliver eight new chapters for the main story, 13 new unit classes, new characters, and additional game modes like the always-welcome New Game+.

Symphony of War moves beyond focusing on specific troops to building up larger squads of up to nine units, eventually giving players command of a full army. The main heroes come into play when it&#x27;s time to lead those squads into the turn-based battles throughout the campaign. Familiar ground for strategy-RPG aficionados, no doubt.
Legends DLC plans to expand upon this these mechanics with a new army meta that introduces necromancy and the undead. If raising an army of your own sounds like too much hassle, maybe literally raising them from the dead would be a more, um, palatable option?
As for the aforementioned new chapters, the eight added to the lineup are concurrent with the existing main story. They&#x27;ll focus on expanding plots and tying up loose ends instead of starting anew with fresh faces and factions. 
We&#x27;ll get to see how it all expands for ourselves when Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga goes live with its Legends DLC on August 28, 2023.

This newest entry is being co-developed by Sledgehammer Games and Infinity Ward, which is the same as the 2011 release. The reveal includes some details on the new content coming to Call of Duty including the first-ever Modern Warfare zombies mode. We also got a reveal trailer that shows off some of the campaign:

                              <span>Quantum probably isn’t the first game that comes to mind when you think of the golden years of the arcade. The 1982 vector cabinet, designed by Betty Ryan, has maybe a less exciting concept than Asteroids or Centipede. In fact, the first time I played it was part of the Atari 50 collection.
Atari and Sneakybox’s Recharged line of titles aren’t leaving anything by the side of the road, however, as Quantum: Recharged is the newest release. Surprisingly, it’s low-key one of my favorites. I’ve never been a massive fan of score-chasing arcade titles, and that hasn’t changed with the Recharged games. I prefer games with a bit of progression to them, and there’s more of that in titles like Gravitar: Recharged. However, the simple and fast design of Quantum really sucked me in.

Whether it&#x27;s actually worth the (checks notes) $50 Rockstar is charging for it is one thing: but at least it comes with the Undead Nightmare DLC, which is one of the silliest romps the studio has ever created.
In other Switch eShop news, Quake II was surprised-released, and we even reviewed it (on PC)! This classic still holds up, but if you want something newer, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is out on August 18.

                              <span>GameMill Entertainment has lifted the lid off of Flu Games The Walking Dead: Destinies. And, uh, they probably should have waited until it cooked for a bit longer before showing it off.
Basing itself off the popular AMC adaptation of The Walking Dead comic book series, The Walking Dead: Destinies promises to be a narrative-focused game that lets you rewrite the events of seasons 1-4 with your actions. I guess a lot of stuff happened in those seasons. I don’t know, I didn’t watch the show. It sounds like if your favorite character died and you want them to stay alive, you might have the option to do so here.

I’m not saying the game looks terrible, but this trailer is absolutely awful. One of the first scenes has a pair of gun-toting dudes approach some sort of compound. They look out over the field, and there’s a bunch of watch towers that don’t have any textures. What’s funny is that the same watch tower model is shown later on in the trailer, but on that occasion, it has textures. There’s also compression all over the video that is so heavy that I had to double-check to make sure I didn’t have it set to 480p.
The game itself looks pretty rough. The graphics seem a couple of generations behind, which I don’t usually mind, but it’s not like the art style was adapted to make up for it. It just looks kind of gross. It could be good, it’s just this trailer certainly doesn’t make it look that way. They probably should have, uh… framed it better.
The Walking Dead: Destinies is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. There’s no release date, but they’re already saying it will be $49.99.

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog, known as Ogilvie Maurice Hedgehog among true fans, is one of the most famous mascots in video game history. Still, unlike Mario, who&#x27;s yet to appear in a mainline game that&#x27;s not an absolute blast, the blue blur is reminiscent of those once-promising actors who had to start taking roles in C-list movies to maintain their exuberantly decadent lifestyle. It&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow, but we have to accept that Sonic has starred in about as many crappy games as he has in good ones.
Which one is the worst of the worst?

                              <span>Gamescom 2023 will be kicking off next week, featuring some of the biggest names in the industry. One such name is AMD, and the PC hardware giant could announce some new lines in its RDNA 3 range.
That&#x27;s if a recent tweet from AMD&#x27;s own Scott Herkelman is anything to go by. Herkelman says that Team Red will be in attendance at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, bringing with it the company&#x27;s &quot;next major product announcements.&quot;
https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1691864001129443634
What this will be exactly we can&#x27;t say. However, judging from the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;announcements,&quot; it sounds like it&#x27;s going to be more than one thing.
New graphics cards, surely?
Suffice it to say, we would assume that AMD will announce its next line of graphics cards in its latest 7000 series. A report from PC Gamer speculates that it could well be the leaked RX 7800 XT.
That may not be all. Some people commenting under Herkelman&#x27;s tweet are holding out that AMD will announce FSR 3. For those who don&#x27;t know, FSR (or FidelityFX Super Resolution) is the tech giant&#x27;s own take on algorithmic graphical upscaling, similar to Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS and Intel&#x27;s Xe Super Sampling.
AMD seems to be trailing behind Nvidia at the moment. Its biggest rival has already released a number of products in its Ada Lovelace range. We&#x27;ve already seen the likes of the RTX 4090 right through to a 4060 from Team Green.
Conversely, there have pretty much only been two launches in AMD&#x27;s RDNA 3 range: the RX 7900 (XT, XTX, and GRE variants) and the RX 7600. Now would the time for Team Red to start unveiling some more in order to keep up with Nvidia.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is 2023&#x27;s seminal CoD release, due to launch in November, but it would seem that Activision&#x27;s got some monumental changes planned for the new game. Or, at least, that&#x27;s what this particular CoD&#x27;s marketing campaign would have you believe. With a huge new information drop slated to go live in very short order, fans of the franchise have already got a whole slew of things to be looking forward to, not the least of which is the return of the legendary Zombies mode.
Naturally, now&#x27;s also the right time to remember that Modern Warfare 2 launched less than a year ago to reasonable critical acclaim, only for Activision to squander any launch-day goodwill over the course of the next couple of seasons.

Notably, Exoprimal&#x27;s  Title Update 1 is already available as of August 16, delivering a strong follow-up to the game&#x27;s official July 14 launch date. Players now have access to a surprisingly large roster of new goodies, the highlight of it all being the introduction of Alpha-variant exosuits.
Exoprimal is, of course, still in its early days, being a live-service title and all that. Capcom did successfully deliver a content-rich and feature-complete game on day one, however, which doesn&#x27;t always happen with games that are supposed to last for years at a time. This means that, even though Exoprimal players have had their hands full since the game&#x27;s come out, they will now…</span>

                              <span>Get ready for liftoff. Starfield preloads begin Thursday as the game has just gone gold (which means Bethesda&#x27;s development of Starfield is effectively complete!). Now, players can download the game pre-release on its platforms, but it will be truly ready to play when September 6 (or September 1 for early access players) rolls around. Unfortunately, Steam users will have to wait longer for Starfield preloads to take effect.
Those who own an Xbox Series X|S or a PC with the Xbox app can preload Starfield on August 17. Players on Steam have to wait much longer as preloading on that platform occurs on August 30. If you&#x27;ve bought the Premium Edition or Constellation Edition physically or digitally, you&#x27;ll be able to gain access to Starfield five days early on September 1. To make the wait even more arduous, the Xbox Twitter page says its hand is moving &quot;closer to [the] giant LAUNCH button.&quot;

After delays, Starfield is actually ready
Starfield was originally going to be released on November 11, 2022, but it was pushed back almost an entire year. “We know you’ve waited a long time to play something new from us,&quot; said director Todd Howard after announcing the September 6 release date in a trailer. &quot;Believe it or not, we’re kind of the same.&quot;
He later said, &quot;We really just can&#x27;t wait for you all to play it.&quot; Now we&#x27;re nearing that time. Many games from Bethesda&#x27;s past were criticized for awkward facial animation and bugs across the board, but this new game engine may take Bethesda to the next level. It could lead to impressive showings for upcoming games like The Elder Scrolls VI. As of last year, that fantasy RPG is currently in a design stage of development.

                              <span>The popular file-hosting site AnonFiles.com has thrown in the towel. The site&#x27;s operators cite massive abuse by uploaders as the reason for the shutdown. AnonFiles tried to limit the problems though automated upload filters and filename restrictions but nothing helped. While the current team says its work is over, others are invited to buy the domain name and give it a shot themselves.

                              <span>Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will stop working altogether.
However, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you&#x27;ll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.
Additionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn&#x27;t encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform&#x27;s most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today&#x27;s announcement post. Here&#x27;s the most recent batch from November 2021:

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.
In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn&#x27;t cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”
This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 
Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game&#x27;s conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. 
Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</span>

Steeped in religious themes, the narrative of Blasphemous 2 tells of a land unable to overcome the curse placed on it by a higher power, regardless of how repentant its people are. Playing Blasphemous 2, I sometimes felt the same, as I wondered how I could possibly overcome the challenge before me. But like the denizens of The City of the Blessed Name, I persevered. And though the curses being thrown around my house each time I died were of a different variety than those cast in Blasphemous 2’s story, I loved nearly every minute o…</span>

Tato migrace má zvýšit kybernetickou bezpečnost uživatelů služeb českého e-governmentu, zvýšit uživatelskou přívětivost, důvěryhodnost a jednotnou prezentaci webových stránek státu a e-mailových domén úředníků.

                              <span>Tvůrci „komerční implementace Wine“ uvádí u nové verze CrossOver 23 pět hlavních novinek. První je podpora DirectX 12 na macOS, která mimo jiné znamená běh her jako Diablo II Resurrected a Diablo IV na macOS Ventura (jde o první DX12 hry, které na této verzi běží, další tituly máme očekávat). Druhou novinkou je podpora Geometry shaderů a transformací na macOS, díky čemuž opět poběží řada dosud nefunkční her (např. TEKKEN 7, Street Fighter V, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries ad.) – s dodatkem, že nejlepší výsledky jsou při běhu přes wined3d (Wine implementace Direct3D) namísto obvyklého DXVK (mapujícího Direct3D na Vulkan).</span>

According to the prosecution, the Russian defendants are fugitives because they continue to protest their extradition to the United States. As such, they should not be allowed to request a dismissal from the U.S. judicial system they are trying to avoid.

                              <span>When The Messenger was released in 2018, Thierry Boulanger went into its launch with reasonable expectations. He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge&#x27;s big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. 
The expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.


Dimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character.

Going &quot;gold” basically means the game is complete and ready to be sent to be printed on discs and shipped to stores. Bethesda also revealed when players can pre-load the digital version of the game. Xbox players can do so beginning tomorrow, August 17. Steam users get their turn on August 30.

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a surprisingly human tale. That may sound strange to say about a game with space lizards and brain worms at its center, but behind the hags and psychic tadpoles, Baldur’s Gate 3 is about a group of very broken people trying to find their way in life and maybe save the world. Or turn it into a smoldering heap of agony and misery. It depends on how you feel that day. Whether you choose peace or something less savory, Baldur’s Gate 3’s intricate writing …</span>

This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. 
Next Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.

The game&#x27;s presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.


Crimson Desert doesn&#x27;t have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We&#x27;ll likely find out of that&#x27;s still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.</span>

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is finally coming to the platform it was always destined for: the Nintendo Switch. Alongside the full game and its DLC being fully playable on Nintendo&#x27;s platform, it also includes a new co-op mode. Join Game Informer&#x27;s Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart to see if the Switch can handle the game firing on all cylinders and to see some of the co-op in action. Vampire Survivors releases on Switch August 17.

                              <span>The Alienware AW3423DWF is an outstanding 34-inch OLED ultra-wide that outperforms basically everything else in its category, except for other OLED models. I took a look at it for Digital Foundry last year, and it remains one of my top choices in 2023. Now, with three years of burn-in warranty as standard and a modest price reduction from $1079 to $899, it&#x27;s well worth writing up in a US deals post for Rock Paper Shotgun!

                              <span>Hold onto your warp nacelles and hyperdrives, Starfield aficionados. The game&#x27;s lead designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen have hosted a Discord Q&amp;A about Bethesda&#x27;s forthcoming space colossus. Self-despising fool that I am, I sat up late at the office taking notes throughout - please accept a modest avalanche of new details.


First off, a note on the subject of Starfield and housing. You can own property in &quot;all the major cities in the game&quot;, according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.


Building on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a &quot;Kids Stuff&quot; trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. &quot;No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles,&quot; Pagliarulo added.

This week, I ask you to choose between deadly openings and safe closings. What&#x27;s better: mimics, or tactically sealing doors?

You know what’s also a pretty great puzzle game set in successive rooms you need to escape? Portal. You may have heard of it. And now the two are set to collide in an upcoming bit of free DLC that brings Portal’s test chambers to Escape Simulator.

                              <span>I keep forgetting that Netflix have their own games offering, despite the streaming giant keeping it well stocked with a fairly solid library of free (if you’re a Netflix subscriber anyway) games - including the likes of Oxenfree 2, Kentucky Route Zero and Immortality. If you wanted some more proof that Netflix is pretty serious about this whole “getting into video games” thing, the movie streaming platform-turned-games publisher is now looking to unite their two fronts by experimenting with game streaming.

                              <span>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.
It seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets.

                              <span>The first game in the Opus series of visual novels (not to be confused with alchemy-themed puzzle machine game Opus Magnum), The Day We Found Earth, begins 14,000 years in the future, on a starship far from our familiar home planet. The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.


Opus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018&#x27;s Rocket Of Whispers and 2021&#x27;s Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. &quot;They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,&quot; is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.

I know there&#x27;s a dungeon master, or DM, who directs proceedings behind a cardboard shield. I know you lob some dice to determine the outcomes of an adventure that&#x27;s contained in the heads of everyone at the roundtable. And that&#x27;s about it.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is based on D&amp;D&#x27;s 5th edition and it&#x27;s meant to honour its rules to the absolute tee. I&#x27;m sure it does! To be honest, though, I haven&#x27;t exactly learned much about D&amp;D by playing it. I don&#x27;t even think of myself as playing D&amp;D, instead I&#x27;m just playing an RPG whose complexity adds a nice mystery to proceedings.

It turns out all those librarians in the 90s were right: using your imagination really is cool and fun! Indeed, our ability to conjure fiction from the ether is fundamental to the ongoing success of D&amp;D. Making up stories with friends is very much a good time, and if you get to kill a goblin or two in the process? Well. That&#x27;s just gravy.


Built upon the foundations of D&amp;D&#x27;s fifth edition ruleset, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 attempts to translate the fundamentals of the game into digital form. But how successful is it at doing so? Can a video game - with all the rigidity that comes with the medium - replicate the freedom of a table-top role playing game?

                              <span>Winding back the clock to rewrite past mistakes is a core stratagem of any Mimimi game. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 might have rekindled the debate about save-scumming over in RPG circles, but in the stealth strategy arena where Mimimi operate, reaching for the F5 and F8 keys to quick load a previous save is as natural as swapping between your party members on 123, or activating their unique abilities to clobber all manner of unsuspecting guards on the back of the head with ASD and F.
In their latest real-time tactics-me-do Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, however, the act of quick saving has been woven directly into the language of the game, presented not as cold, hard button commands, but as &#x27;captured memories&#x27; that your magical ghost ship The Red Marley is able to unleash to make sure your supernatural pirate crew don&#x27;t get caught or die (again) on the job.

                              <span>MiHoYo have released Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s update, adding a new area, story elements, characters, domains and equipment to the gacha-driven free-to-play action RPG, which I remember having a lot of fun with last year. I&#x27;ve since inhaled a vast amount of shonen anime, and have accordingly been looking for a moment to reconnect with Genshin, one of the better anime games on the shop - perhaps this is it.


As Rebecca (RPS in peace, sob) wrote last week, Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s big new feature is the the sunken kingdom of Fontaine, which you can dive into after completing prologue mission Act III and unlocking the associated teleport waypoint in Sumeru.

Tantalisingly, these include a few changes asked for by players. &quot;Our focus now is fixing any issues you report, but we are listening to suggestions,&quot; Vincke wrote on Xitter. &quot;Current roadmap: a) Hotfix 4, b) Patch 1 (+1000 fixes and tweaks), c) Patch 2.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s 27GN950 monitor is one of my all-time favourites, as it&#x27;s the perfect complement to a high-end gaming PC. You get a 4K resolution for pin-sharp graphics and text, a 144Hz refresh rate and Fast IPS panel for excellent motion handling, and a 27-inch span that fits easily onto a desk or monitor arm. After debuting at an eye-watering $800, this monitor has dropped on Amazon.com to a more reasonable $543.

                              <span>Being a reviewer during Big Game Season often feels like being chased through a massive, winding building in a serial killer movie (or possibly Until Dawn). You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;. You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you&#x27;re commissioned to do a, haha, &quot;retrospective&quot; 10 years later.
This summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy 16&quot;, then spent a frantic moment trying to force the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I&#x27;m mixing my scenarios - it&#x27;s the end of the day and I&#x27;m tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.

                              <span>Paradox have posted a Cities: Skylines 2 developer diary in which the studio discusses the new game&#x27;s rather elaborate-sounding economy simulation. This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.

                              <span>There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. 
Still. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.

                              <span>I have, for the past several weeks, been playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the RPG equivalent of paying for ex-special forces lads to kidnap you at an unappointed day when you&#x27;re walking your labradoodle, and put you through a rigorous (pretend) interrogation schedule. Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it&#x27;s over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.
Hammerwatch 2 is out today, and it&#x27;s kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It&#x27;s like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as &quot;adorable&quot;, and it makes everything seem like it&#x27;s a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don&#x27;t want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn&#x27;t quite right and there&#x27;s some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.

                              <span>SPOILER WARNING FOR PEOPLE SENSITIVE TO SPOILERS. SPOILERS. I HAVE WARNED YOU. RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.
I met this really nice bard in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.
Anyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. &quot;Of course, we&#x27;d love to have you,&quot; I replied. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>Sclash is gorgeous. That&#x27;s not the reason I&#x27;m writing about it, but it definitely helps. Style can&#x27;t fix a bad game, but it can elevate a decent one about, say, a little hand-drawn 2D samurai running across the world stabbing dudes for peace. Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.


There is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as &quot;coming soon&quot;. But even with remote multiplayer, I see this as more of a diversion for friends to enjoy than a serious competitive fighter and intentionally so.


I enjoyed it though. Actually, I think I enjoyed it more for that, though it does perhaps limit its audience.

                              <span>This week I wrote a little post alerting you, my best friends, to the existence of Murdle. This weekend I went to town and bought a copy of the Murdle book - or, I should say, Volume 1, because you can already pre-order Volume 2. It&#x27;s a chunky enough tome made up of 100 of the puzzles that form Murdle&#x27;s daily little treat, split into sections of escalating difficulty. And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.

                              <span>I used to be into deserts, but ever since Kenshi I have become a swamp fangirl. I also consider nomadic cultures to be woefully under-represented in games. You&#x27;d think, then, that a game about a nomadic Iron Age people larking about in a horrible swamp would be made for me, but unfortunately, Gord is somehow both a game where you can feed a child to a forest-dwelling horror, and a game that&#x27;s kind of dull.
It&#x27;s the only memorable thing that happened, and I did it to save time. The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been itching to play The Lords Of The Fallen since I discovered that it&#x27;s a closet Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver homage (see my bio), with a sorcerous lantern that lets you switch between the living and unliving worlds of Axiom and Umbral. Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you&#x27;ll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.
You&#x27;re also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you&#x27;ll have to restart from one of the game&#x27;s Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I&#x27;m hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game&#x27;s many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.

Here are some things I might do if I were locked in my boss&#x27;s office (sorry Katharine): approve expense claims, sift their browser history for blackmail material and oh, who am I kidding, what I&#x27;d really do is perch on the desk, quiet as a churchmouse, waiting to be let out. Orbo&#x27;s boss keeps an... atypical office, however. It harbours product portals that take you to alternate worlds, hewn from the same seam of weirdness as Psychonauts.

The scrollable chronology, which runs from 2050 to 2160, charts the origins of the war between the United Colonies and Freestar Collective factions, who sound more and more to me like the Union and the Confederacy in the US Civil War. We&#x27;re also told about the formation of the Constellation organisation, a group of swashbuckling pioneers who are concerned with the origins of certain mystic Artifacts. And we get to read a little about a few key Starfield characters, such as space cowboy Sam Coe, careworn ex-soldier Sarah Morgan and sciencehunk Barrett.

                              <span>Star Wars is no stranger to video game adaptation. In fact, depending on your age, video games may be the primary way you interact with the far away galaxy from a long time ago. Outlaws, however, represent something new for the franchise, even if it isn’t new to video games. We’ve shot from the first-person perspective in Battlefront, explored labyrinthine, Metroid-inspired levels in Respawn’s Jedi games, and even commanded armies in Empire at War, but Outlaws is the first time we will explore an open Star Wars world.
Following a panel on the game at Comic-Con, we spoke with Outlaws&#x27; narrative director, Navid Khavari, over e-mail about a number of topics related to the game, including potential overlap with Shadows of the Empire, what exactly protagonist Kay Vess is going after, the fate o…</span>

                              <span>Bungie is holding its annual Destiny 2 Showcase on August 22. The event will shed more light on The Final Shape expansion and other upcoming events.
The event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga. That means everything that has occurred up to this point will culminate with this story. Speaking of which, Bungie released a new video recapping the biggest moments of the Destiny journey.


The showcase will also dive into Season 22, the next reprised raid, among other announcements. For more on Destiny 2, check out our review of its most recent expansion Lightfall, then read about how Keith David has been cast as the new voice of Commander Zavala.

Musí však jít o originální dílo vytvořené konkrétně pro tuto soutěž a vydané pod licencí CC-BY-SA-4.0. Explicitně jsou tak vyloučeny wallpapery vytvořené pomocí AI.</span>

A lite RPG based on historical rap-musical Hamilton you can play via Roblox, that’s what.

                              <span>IO Interactive have found such success with Hitman over the past decade that it&#x27;s hard to imagine the developer making anything else, but I have many vivid memories of its non-Agent-47-centric outings. 2010&#x27;s Kane &amp; Lynch 2 was a very special breed of spiritual ugliness, while 2003&#x27;s Freedom Fighters wowed youngling me with its chunky urban squad tactics. I also have a soft spot for Mini Ninjas, one of IO&#x27;s few jaunts into the realm of family-friendliness, if only because as somebody familiar with IO&#x27;s other work, I could smell the blood beneath its bloodless Nickleodeon visuals.
I&#x27;m keen to hear more of the studio&#x27;s forthcoming James Bond adaptation, unveiled in 2020 - surely a marriage made in franchising heaven, though I struggle to imagine an IO protagonist quipping like 007. But I&#x27;m especially eager to lay eyes on its currently untitled Project Fantasy, an online RPG inspired by &quot;the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight&quot; of table-top gaming and more specifically, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone&#x27;s Fighting Fantasy books.

That&#x27;s a surprisingly awesome deal and would make the perfect beginnings of a high-end rig, with just a GPU, CPU cooler, SSD, PSU and case needed for a complete build - many of which you may want to bring over from your existing PC.

                              <span>If you can believe it, we first wrote about Small Saga, the retro-flavoured turn-based RPG filled with penknife-wielding rodents and fireballs cast from cigarette lighters, a little over four years ago. Clearly inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy - albeit crossed with the ‘small animals on a big adventure’ feel of Brian Jacques&#x27; Redwall novels - it looked absolutely brilliant. That sentiment was only solidified by its Steam Next Fest demo last year, which left Katharine impressed by its compelling combat and rodent fantasy setting. It’s been quite the journey for the indie RPG, but we won’t have to wait much longer to see what Small Saga has to offer in full, as it finally has a release date.

                              <span>For all the big-budget GeForce graphics cards, it’s the firmly mainstream XX60 models that must surely keep the lights on at Nvidia HQ. A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.
The RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.

                              <span>In the picturesque Regency town of Leamington Spa, a debutante has entered the local high society of AAA game developers. Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”


One of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.

If you&#x27;re new to the much-imitated Vampire Survivors format, the idea is to steer an auto-attacking character around a map that is slowly invaded by increasingly hazardous waves of foes, levelling up as you go. Think of it as a bullet hell shooter, but set to the tune of a walking sim. At first, anyway: at higher levels, Vampire Survivors is a perfectly withering experience, for all its initial glacial pace.

                              <span>Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you&#x27;re unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski&#x27;s first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don&#x27;t half move around in this industry.
I never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski&#x27;s follow-up remark that he&#x27;d like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.

                              <span>Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic&#x27;s highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM&#x27;s Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they&#x27;re both on 97, but I&#x27;m guessing the &quot;score distillation&quot; arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian&#x27;s new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.


It&#x27;s a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&amp;D adaptations ever set to code. It&#x27;s also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you&#x27;ve likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today&#x27;s &quot;triple-A games&quot;, aka &quot;biggest/shiniest&quot;. Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall &quot;quality&quot;. A few people go into specifics: I&#x27;ve read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.

A Michigan district court found Sven Hansche liable for 748 violations of copyright law and was guided on damages awarded in lawsuits against IPTV providers Nitro TV and Area 51.

The anti-piracy group recently closed the books on a multi-year case against the once-largest IPTV service in the Netherlands. While the matter had a successful outcome, it took multiple trips to court to wrap things up neatly.

                              <span>V procesorech AMD Zen 1 se objevila chyba, kdy při dělení nulou mohou uniknout data. Oprava se dostala v pátek do jádra 6.4.10, 6.1.45, 5.15.126 a 5.10.190. Nicméně stejný autor Boris Petkov přišel s tím, že původní oprava není dostatečná. Nestačí přidávat dělení nulou jen při obsluze výjimky, protože kvůli spekulaci mohou stejně data utéci.</span>

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and after years of rumors and delays, its release date is still just out of reach. However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they&#x27;re done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.

The game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.
In an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it&#x27;s a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with &quot;other RPGs,&quot; which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage&#x27;s new date doesn&#x27;t seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.

Through a new trailer that premiered at the Pokémon World Championships last weekend, we&#x27;ve learned that The Indigo Disk, part two of the DLC, will have returning favorites, brand-new moves, and a mysterious nineteenth Tera Type.


Right off the bat, the trailer starts with an exciting reveal: every past first partner Pokémon (known more commonly as &quot;starters&quot;) will be returning in the Winter expansion. In most games in the series, starters can only be obtained at the very start of the game, and you can only ever obtain one of three. They&#x27;re also typically exclusive to every region, so partner Pokémon from Gold…</span>

The library and book publishers have agreed the terms of a judgment that leaves one crucial question open for the court. While restrictions are unavoidable, for now, the Internet Archive is eager to reverse the court&#x27;s liability ruling on appeal.

I&#x27;ve played it for eight hours since buying it yesterday, hooked by a progression curve that takes you from an ineffectual mining ship chipping at a single planet&#x27;s rocky surface until you explode, to the leader of a swarm of bomb-dropping drones and aerial bombardment lasers that can travel a solar system and devour any planet to its core in seconds.

So far, so Opus Magnum. The twist is that your only resource is a sans-serif letter &quot;I&quot;, which you&#x27;re manipulating and combining to make every other letter in the alphabet - and, in turn, to construct whole words to complete each level. It&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>The Anno series has never had official mod support, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped its community from producing hundreds of mods for Anno 1800 since its release in 2019. Ubisoft have seemingly noticed. They&#x27;re now partnering with mod.io to add official mod support to the game.

                              <span>Long-running animated series South Park has been blessed with two surprisingly good RPGs, the Stick Of Truth and the Fractured But Whole, which both accurately recreated the TV show&#x27;s art style. The newly announced South Park: Snow Day is taking a different approach, rendering Cartman and its world in 3D for a four-player co-op action game. It&#x27;s also being developed by first-person indie darlings Question. You&#x27;ll find the trailer below.

And by &quot;the real world&quot; I mean &quot;other video games&quot;. Although not many, admittedly. BG3 is very big. I think I&#x27;ll be the first to break free from its metaphorical chains because I played it for review, but I&#x27;m still puttering about trying to take the roads I un-taked the first time. Still, we&#x27;ve got time for some Apelegs and some little demos and some seeeeecrets and whatnot.

ISPs had no choice but to comply with the court&#x27;s instructions which took out countless Cloudflare customers in Austria. According to reviews conducted by local telecoms regulator TKK, the IP address blocking violated net neutrality regulations and will no longer be allowed.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we learned about a new game starring everyone&#x27;s favorite raunchy Colorado kids. South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series&#x27; legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. 
Starring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.


We don&#x27;t have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia. In the past, the studio has worked on The Blackout Club and The Magic Circle. South Park: Snow Day! is set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2024.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven&#x27;t heard much since then, today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.
In the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. &quot;Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.&quot;


According to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn&#x27;t currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in gaming, be sure to check out our review of TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge and our in-depth impressions of TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.</span>

                              <span>Super Replay returns, and we&#x27;re checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts!  Released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008, the third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare&#x27;s beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will we land on it? Let&#x27;s find out. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore one of the Xbox 360&#x27;s biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 is off to a pretty great start in terms of its, thus far, glowing reception and player engagement. Developer Larian Studios has released a fun infographic accumulating player data gathered from the game’s first weekend, and the results are a mix of surprising, amusing, and flat-out staggering.
Last weekend, you played 1225 years of Baldur’s Gate 3. As we head into the second weekend of launch, we’ve compiled some tasty stats for you to sink your teeth into.

August 11, 2023
You can view the fun infographic in the embedded tweet above, but we’ve summarized each bullet point below:
368 players finished the game during the opening weekend.
Over 93% of players rolled a custom character
Players spent a combined 88 years in character creation
Nearly 10% of characters spent at least one hour in character creation
Gale was the most popular Origin character selected at 27,784 players
Gale was the 7th cause of death for players
Paladin was the most popular class choice at over 200K players
Half-Elf was the most popular race choice at over 250K players (barely edging out Human at 2nd and Elf at 3rd)
Almost 100,000 players have been rejected by Astarion (Shadowheart was the most popular romance option, followed by Gale)
One NPC was shoved into a chasm for every concurrent player during peak engagement on Sunday (815,000 players)
12% of player deaths were caused by friendly fire
65.1% of players saved Emerald Grove
Scratch has been petted over 750,000 times
Players spoke to over 1,400,000 corpses and over 2,400,000 animals
Players have played at least 10,000,000 hours (over 1,225 years)
Needless to say, a lot of players appear to be having a great time with Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and we look forward to seeing how these stats evolve over time, especially once the PlayStation 5 version launches next month. Stay tuned to Game Informer for our impending review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and let us know what you think of the game in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the mobile RPG retelling the FFVII saga, finally has a release date. The game was first announced in February 2021. 
Ever Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.


This will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.</span>

                              <span>Airhead is one of those platformers I really want to like. Freshly announced at tonight&#x27;s THQ Nordic Showcase, I&#x27;ve been playing an early, hour-long demo build of it this week, and while there are certainly things to admire here, I&#x27;m not overly convinced it&#x27;s going to be one for the ages. Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn&#x27;t quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be.

                              <span>While we continue to hope and wait for news of another Command &amp; Conquered Remastered Collection, I&#x27;d recommend giving Tempest Rising a look to tide you over, especially now there&#x27;s a free demo for it over on Steam. You don&#x27;t have long to give it a pop - it will disappear on August 28th - but this base-building RTS harks back to the C&amp;C days of yore with its diverse set of units and industrial metal soundtrack. I played a version of this demo earlier in the year and had a great time with it, so it&#x27;s worth seeking out over the weekend if you get a spare moment.

                              <span>THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios have semi-re-announced Outcast 2: A New Beginning as plain old Outcast: A New Beginning, having sensibly decided that positioning it as a sequel to a 24-year-old game might turn younger audiences away. In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.
In Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You&#x27;re here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can&#x27;t argue with the verticality and agility on display.

                              <span>Way back in the dingy darkness of 1997 I played a property management sim called Constructor, in which you could do things like bury rivals in their own cement, and have your foreman take down the other guy&#x27;s hooligans with a shotgun. I&#x27;ve never played any property sim that&#x27;s quite as nasty, but I do get a similar vibe from Mirage Game Studios&#x27; Space For Sale, published by THQ Nordic, in which one or two players throw together budget rentals for aliens on a decidedly unfriendly planet. We caught a glimpse of it at a presentation a few days ago, and despite my better nature I am keen to dig in.

                              <span>THQ Nordic have announced Titan Quest 2, a sequel to Iron Lore Entertainment&#x27;s action RPG of 2006, which was kind of a classical variation on Diablo with players touring Ancient Greece, Egypt and China in search of chthonic beasts to slay. The new game is the work of Grimlore Games, creator of Spellforce III and one of THQ Nordic&#x27;s first internal development studios. It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.

Specifically, pastures that have had the letters and numbers VG247 mown into them, as Rebecca is beginning a new guides journey at our dear sister site starting next week. We wish her all the best in her new adventures, follicking in the fields of Animal Crossing and other console-based delights, although I&#x27;ll personally be very sad to lose my fellow Zero Escape and Danganronpa liker (the placement of these games in next year&#x27;s RPS 100 is now in serious trouble, folks, I&#x27;m telling ya now). But before we get too deep in the doom and gloom, come and bid her farewell in the comments below.

It will tell you how fast it runs games, how hot it gets, how it compares to Nvidia’s RTX 4060 and suchlike. What I can’t explain with it, admittedly, is why the RX 7600 exists.

I met another player who likes rolling rangers at a D&amp;D table earlier this week, and I actually high-fived her because I was so excited at my one-woman ranger defense squad doubling its membership. Making your character a ranger in BG3 (which has some very slight differences) is even better; you can essentially brew a rogue that is better at taking damage, but can still do most other things you traditionally use a rogue for. Let me explain.

                              <span>One thing I never tire of ranting about is the brilliance of the original Homeworld Mothership - both for its elegant crescent-moon design, and for its more practical function as a giant compass needle shoved into Homeworld&#x27;s then-unprecedented 3D volumes, so that players can orient themselves and strategise. I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3&#x27;s redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s. But I&#x27;ve come round to the new Mothership after reading Blackbird Interactive art director Karl Gryc&#x27;s thoughts on its creation.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve not written about Murdle because I figured we had probably already written about Murdle, back when loads of Wordle-likes were popping up. Imagine my shock when searching for Murdle on the site this morning returned no results. This is the RPS dep ed version of saying you can&#x27;t find the big scissors without looking in the kitchen drawer first.
Murdle is a free daily logic puzzle game that you can play in-browser at murdle.com. They&#x27;re like luxury versions of those ones you&#x27;d get in thick, half-sized paperbacks from WH Smiths, next to the books of sudoku, where you have to figure out who lives in which house and what colour their car is with clues like &#x27;Peter does not not have a four-wheeled drive. Murdle is better, though, because the puzzles are themed around being a detective - or, technically, a Deductive - called Logico solving a murder. You get a new one every day, and it&#x27;s neat-o.

                              <span>AMD and Bethesda have unveiled a limited-edition Starfield-themed Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU and Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU at Quakecon 2023. Both are decorated according to the forthcoming open world space-me-do&#x27;s &quot;NASApunk&quot; aesthetic, a blend of cool whites, blues and yellows which I will admit to finding rather attractive, as somebody who generally finds gaming hardware aesthetics an absolute turn-off. It&#x27;s certainly better-looking than Nvidia&#x27;s lurid Cyberpunk 2077 GPU from 2020, but if you&#x27;re similarly beguiled, there&#x27;s an unfortunate catch: only 500 of these GPU/CPU sets are being made, and they&#x27;re exclusively available as part of a Quakecon giveaway.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who&#x27;ve already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an &quot;Overwhelmingly Negative&quot; rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game&#x27;s direction and faults.


Many players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2&#x27;s switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2&#x27;s story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard&#x27;s recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard&#x27;s alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch&#x27;s emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.

                              <span>What comes with free Gunnar blue light glasses and a copy of Starfield? Yup, it&#x27;s the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D when you buy it from Scan, and no I didn&#x27;t expect that either. Still, these freebies are on top of the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for the fastest gaming CPU on the market, making this a deal that&#x27;s well worth your time if you&#x27;re considering a new gaming rig.

                              <span>Asus has some of the best industrial designers in the PC space, and that&#x27;s normally best appreciated on their laptops and motherboards. However, the Taiwanese company also produces some great PC cases, such as the subject of today&#x27;s deals post: the ROG Z11 Mini ITX. This small form factor case comes in a beautiful tower style with impressive front I/O and a tilted motherboard tray that enhances airflow. It&#x27;s a cool, funky little case and well worth considering at its reduced price of £99.98, down from its original UK RRP of £240.

                              <span>It&#x27;s possible you&#x27;ve already played some of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, with Larian Studios having had their massive fantasy RPG in a successful early access for just under three years. It&#x27;s very good. But if you&#x27;re one of the many who haven&#x27;t, the premise is thus: an ancient evil has, as ancient evil is wont to do, arisen once more to threaten the great walled city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate, and by extension the surrounds, and by further extension the world and all the deep gnomes, elves and sexy demon wizards therein. Through happenstance and literal brainworms, you and the band of strange adventurers you meet in the first act are the only ones who can save the day. Don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t need to remember or have played Baldur&#x27;s Gate 1 or 2. So. Off you go, then.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Destiny 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (among many other roles) actor Lance Reddick passed away unexpectedly. In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.
Today, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).
He has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint&#x27;s Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.
In the post on Bungie&#x27;s site announcing the casting, David said, &quot;I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character&#x27;s sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.&quot;</span>

                              <span>To say that Overwatch 2 has had a rough start to its lifecycle would be an understatement. After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game&#x27;s lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game&#x27;s structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions. However, with Season 6, titled Invasion, the Overwatch 2 development team is making huge strides to release a content drop absolutely jam-packed with new modes, new maps, and even a new support hero. Following my exclusive look at Overwatch 2&#x27;s Toronto Story Mission back in June, I was once again invited to go hands-on with Overwatch 2: Invasion – this time, with the entire Invasion update.

The first Lords of the Fallen released in 2014, a time when From Software’s Dark Souls series consisted of two games. Bloodborne wasn’t out, and Elden Ring hadn’t yet redefined what the action-RPG genre can be. Lords of the Fallen was among the first Soulslikes to appear on my radar. It didn’t hit for me and I put it down after a few hours. It was slow, clunky, and allowed for little wiggle room in gameplay style. I yearned for the flexibility of Dark Souls’ various classes and the speed some of them allowed.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was recently announced to launch in November, and a new trailer teases its antagonist: Makarov. The final big bad from the original Modern Warfare trilogy is back in full force, which means bad news for Task Force 141. 
Older fans know him as Vladimir Makarov, the side antagonist in 2009&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 and the primary threat in 2011’s MW3. He’s set to take that head villain mantle once again in the third entry of the rebooted trilogy, and a trailer appropriately paints him as the boogeyman set to make Captain Price and Co.’s lives a living hell. The trailer also teases a full reveal of the game on August 17.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III is set to release on November 10.</span>

I&#x27;m a fan of musicals of all kinds. From Hamilton to La La Land to Bob&#x27;s Burgers, if the characters in your story burst into song, I&#x27;m more than likely on board. For this exact reason, Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical caught my eye, exciting both my inner fan of musicals and my inner fan of games. Despite some complaints about glitches and awkward songwriting in a few places, developer Summerfall Studios harmonizes these concepts well, putting on a show I can&#x27;t help but applaud.

                              <span>For composer Austin Wintory, Stray Gods started with a rejected pitch.
Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory&#x27;s friend was less than enthusiastic.
&quot;He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, &#x27;I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,&#x27;&quot; Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I&#x27;m currently interviewing him about.

However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here&#x27;s everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you&#x27;ll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…</span>

                              <span>If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they&#x27;ll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.</span>

                              <span>Detective Pikachu Returns got a new trailer during this morning’s Pokemon Presents, running down the cast of characters and pocket monsters you’ll encounter during your investigations.
Our chatty electric rodent is, of course, joined by his human partner Tim Goodman. The trailer also reacquaints us with Tim’s family, his friend Rachel and her major father, along with some of the Pokémon lending a helpful hand like the clue-sniffing Growlithe. The trailer also shows off some of the investigative gameplay.


Detective Pikachu Returns arrives on Switch on October 6. For our thoughts on the first game, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password &quot;GETYOURMEW&quot; before September 18. Each Mew&#x27;s Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon&#x27;s flexible capabilities. You&#x27;ll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you&#x27;re able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect &quot;something special.&quot;
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you&#x27;re more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two &#x27;90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.</span>

                              <span>Two classic Pokémon games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today in the form of Pokémon Trading Card Game and Pokémon Stadium 2. Both will be available later today.
Pokémon Trading Card Game was released for the GameBoy in 1998 and has a similar format to the traditional RPG series, except you&#x27;re battling with cards instead of actual monsters. Pokémon Stadium 2 arrived in the U.S. for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 and is, obviously, the sequel to the first Stadium, which is already available on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. 
While these aren&#x27;t the much-requested Red/Blue/Yellow games (or any RPG, for that matter), this is a step in the right direction. Be sure to check out our complete list of every game available on Nintendo Switch Online to keep up with each addition.</span>

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it&#x27;ll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it&#x27;s still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer&#x27;s last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.</span>

                              <span>Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

                              <span>Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a &quot;Devolver Delayed Showcase&quot; to tell players all about the games they won&#x27;t be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
&quot;We have some exciting news about next year,&quot; one host says. &quot;This year&#x27;s delays,&quot; the other host follows up. &quot;Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!&quot;
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today&#x27;s delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it&#x27;s better to delay a game than to launch it before it&#x27;s ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.</span>

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it&#x27;s unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.</span>

                              <span>Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend&#x27;s Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn&#x27;t stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as &quot;a manaical poison aficionado,&quot; A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is popular right now. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is also pretty hot at the moment, especially with a new animated film out in theaters. That’s probably why Capcom is bringing the latter into the former in a fun-looking collaboration.
Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. 


Street FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.</span>

                              <span>A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 &amp; Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
