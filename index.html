Gearbox Entertainment, the developer/publisher behind the Borderlands franchise, has announced that it has extended its development to China, with the founding of Gearbox Studios Shanghai.
The new studio — formerly Eidos Shanghai — represents Gearbox Entertainment&#x27;s first foray into Asia, which the studio notes is an important market in its long-term growth strategy. Gearbox Games Shanghai will be headed up by former Eidos Shanghai manager Gigi Ning. The new division will assist Gearbox in the development, marketing, and release of future projects, both locally and globally.
&quot;Bringing Gearbox’s vision and creative spirit to our local community is a goal we’re ready to take on,&quot; said Ning in a press release. &quot;Gearbox has so many fantastic stories to…</span>

Sonic Frontiers has been marinating for a bit, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s a contextual success. While 3D Sonic games tend to be polarizing no matter what, many folks have taken to Frontiers, in part due to the promise of what this could bring for the future. Finally, I think Sega may have created a blueprint to follow for a really ace 3D Sonic game again (so naturally, they&#x27;ll probably scrap everything and start over on the next go-around).
Until that happens, you can enjoy Frontiers a bit more thanks to some free DLC. In a collaboration with Capcom, Sonic is teaming up with the Monster Hunter series, complete with a new outfit and an extra minigame. It&#x27;s not much, but if you&#x27;re still playing through the core game (or going for a 100% rating), you can at least play around with the outfit. Note that you&#x27;ll access it via the &quot;extras&quot; option in the main menu (before you load up a game).
Remember that this is in addition to the free SA2 shoes DLC, which is available to everyone until January. Hopefully there&#x27;s more on the way! Crossovers are perfect for the Sonic series, especially other Sega properties.

Player First Games has completed the first season of its crossover scrapper MultiVersus, with the free-to-play fighter making quite a splash in its opening months. Still essentially in open beta — despite its run of content drops and tournaments — Season 2 will bring new modes, characters, stages, and more.
MultiVersus Season 2 is getting off to something of a quiet start, with no immediate announcement regarding new characters, but today will see the title get a brand new Battle Pass, which will now no longer feature any empty tiers. Somewhat suspiciously, the patch notes point out that the developer has &quot;Tuned the number of points required to complete each tier so that the Battle Pass feels both engaging and rewarding.&quot; Hmm...

Naruto fans have reason to raise their eyebrows (and arms) today, as a Bandai Namco trademark seemingly points to a new title in CyberConnect2 developed Ultimate Ninja Storm series.
As spotted by Gematsu, Bandai Namco filed a trademark just yesterday with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for an &quot;Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections&quot; — a title that has yet to be announced or even hinted at by the publisher.
The series&#x27; most recent entry, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, launched way back in 2016, (although it did receive a Switch port in 2020), so it has been quite some time since Naruto and pals got their... erm... Ultimate Ninja on. The most recent Naruto title was 2018&#x27;s Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Strikers, though some of the anime/manga series&#x27; spritely sluggers have since joined the roster of crossover characters in Epic Games&#x27; battle royale juggernaut Fortnite.
No doubt we will be hearing more news on this new Naruto trademark from Bandai Namco at some point in the near future. In the meantime, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>Warzone 2 drops tomorrow, November 16th, bringing a DMZ extraction mode, Al Mazrah map, and an all-new map-based battle pass. Some Call Of Duty players looking forward to getting their itchy trigger fingers on the free-to-play battle royale have been struggling to sort out their preloads, though. This confusion echoes what happened with Modern Warfare 2019 when Warzone 1.0 launched back in 2020.

                              <span>Straighten up your big rig’s neon signs and make sure you’re sitting comfortably, because American Truck Simulator devs SCS Software have sneakily revealed Oklahoma as the game’s next DLC. A store page for the Oklahoma expansion has popped up on Steam, although there hasn’t been an official announcement just yet. That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that&#x27;s out of the way.

Well, the game’s slipped out of its 2023 release window and into the distant reaches of 2024, devs Pearl Abyss have revealed. DokeV.Club report that Pearl Abyss CEO Heo Jin-young acknowledged that the game would overshoot 2023 during the company’s earnings conference call last week.

We can expect them to arrive in Overwatch 2 when Season 3 of the game begins in early February 2023.

                              <span>It’s late evening. A family is dozing in front of the TV, their dog at their feet. Suddenly the TV turns to static, the ground shakes. While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.
Somerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

He told The Verge this in a new interview where he also revealed that no part of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard is about pulling the rug from underneath PlayStation&#x27;s plans; it&#x27;s just that the two parties can&#x27;t write a contract that says explicitly Call of Duty will be on PlayStation &quot;forever.&quot; 
&quot;It&#x27;s not about at some point I pull the rug underneath PlayStation 7&#x27;s legs, and it&#x27;s &#x27;ahaha you just didn&#x27;t write the contract long enough,&#x27;&quot; Spencer told The Verge. &quot;There&#x27;s no contract that could be written that says forever.&quot;

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…</span>

                              <span>No, it&#x27;s nothing to do with Sports Story.
Back in August we were sideswiped by the news of Soccer Story&#x27;s existence. A pixel art sports RPG with 50% of its title dedicated to the word &#x27;Story&#x27; that isn&#x27;t anything to do with Sidebar Games&#x27; Golf Story nor its hotly-anticipated follow-up Sports Story? Surely it can&#x27;t be!
Well, it turns out that it can be, and it has landed itself a Switch release date of 29th November, 2022 - as if there won&#x27;t be enough football around at that point.

We know, and you know, that Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet — Generation IX — is just days away. And if you&#x27;re anything like us, you&#x27;re probably still stewing over which starter Pokémon to choose. Well, today is a Tuesday, so The Pokémon Company has decided to bestow a brand new name for this day for all of us trainers looking ahead to Paldea on Friday — so, happy ChooseDay!
The official Pokémon UK Twitter is dedicating the whole day to our brand new trio of starters — Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. These were first revealed in February 2022 in Scarlet &amp; Violet&#x27;s debut trailer, and we&#x27;ve been weighing up our options ever since. Look, they&#x27;re just all so darned cute!

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

We last heard of the title back at the Gamescom Future Games Show in August where we got to see a little bit of footage showing this fantasy world in action with the tentative release date of &quot;Fall 2022&quot;. After a few months of relative silence on the matter, we now know not only that the game is coming soon, but it&#x27;s coming really soon - today (15th November, 2022) at 5pm GMT / 6pm EST / 9am PST, to be precise.

Love it or hate it, there is no denying that the Grand Theft Auto series is huge. It is big enough to have GTA 6 subjected to leaks for months, big enough to have its iconic trilogy ported to Switch (in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition) with terrible effect last year and, it turns out, it was almost big enough to spawn its own Eminem-starring movie back in the early 2000s.
In a recent chat on the Bugzy Malone&#x27;s Grandest Game podcast, Hollywood agent Kirk Ewing spoke about how he found himself in the middle of discussions between film producers and Rockstar Games on the potential of the GTA movie.

                              <span>Rolling the dice.
One of the only real criticisms we levelled at the recent Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters, a re-release of a Neo Geo Pocket Color title included in this new package, was that nobody had bothered to translate the content from Japanese. It was an issue exacerbated by a fan translation already existing online for those willing to go the emulation route. Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol.2, on the same basis, is equally disappointing.
There are ten titles on board this follow-up to Vol.1 — four of which are already available to buy separately on Switch eShop — nicely presented as little cartridges on the menu, each with a variety of options. The language barrier issue affects three titles, one of which is the aforementioned Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters. The other two are board game King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise, and minigame/sim curio Ganbare Neo Poke-Kun, both of which are fairly well-known to Neo Pocket aficionados as two of the system’s more intriguing titles.

                              <span>Take a tour around Brinewater.
Yesterday&#x27;s announcement of the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, &#x27;Chill Season 2022&#x27;, might have caught many of us off guard, but there&#x27;s no way that Nintendo is going to let any of the bonus content slip our minds. The detailed looks at the update began today with a walkthrough of what we can expect from the game&#x27;s soon-to-be newest stage, Brinewater Springs.
There was a certain amount of location-specific content to be had in the Chill Season announcement, though we didn&#x27;t get a look at the new map in this much detail. The stage looks to be set in an urban village home to some traditional architecture. There are also slopes and fountains a-plenty here, so the tactic will either be to find a good spot with a Charger up high, or take the dry spots of the arena by force with closer-range weapons.

A new deep-dive article into the history of Maxis&#x27; ill-fated SimCopter 64 has been published by the fine folk over the Video Game History Foundation, and it delivers some fascinating new insight and information about the unreleased Nintendo 64 game.
This particular prototype build — unrelated to a later version that came to light earlier this year — is the E3 1997 demo and has been dumped and preserved after being supplied to the VGHF by an anonymous donor. Previously, off-screen showfloor footage was all that was available, but the game has now been archived for posterity, with the video above captured on real hardware.

After arriving on mobile earlier this year to heaps of cozy praise, studios 7LEVELS and Afterburn have announced that the track-laying train puzzler Railbound is coming to Switch on 1st December, 2022.
For levels of comfort, Railbound has it all. This is a game in which you help two dogs go on a train journey by connecting tracks across various simplistically cartoon landscapes, all accompanied by chilled-out tunes from the team behind equally cozy titles Golf Peaks and inbento. Dogs. Trains. Cartoons. Puzzles. We can feel the thick jumper and fluffy slippers on already.

We have known that golf was going to be swinging its way onto Nintendo Switch Sports at some point soon for a while now (ever since it was delayed to the holiday season in September&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, to be precise), what we didn&#x27;t know was exactly when it would be arriving.
According to a new Japanese advert for the game (found above), not only could golf be arriving sooner than expected, but it is coming later this month - for players in Japan, at least (thanks, Go Nintendo).

The latest UK charts for boxed game sales is now in and what we are seeing this week paints quite a different picture to what has come before.
It should come as no surprise that Nintendo doesn&#x27;t hold the top spot this week. The release of God of War: Ragnarök was always going to shake things up a little as Sony&#x27;s highly-anticipated (and much-nominated) sequel claims the top spot.

Nintendo has just rolled out a bunch of updates for a number of games including ARMS. This title originally made its debut on the Switch in 2017 and is one of the newest IPs from Nintendo in recent years.
The last update was rolled out in September 2018 and made a number of balance adjustments. The latest one isn&#x27;t quite as exciting. Like the latest update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo says &quot;several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience&quot;.

Surprise, Nintendo has just released a brand new update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Believe it or not, but this is the first one we&#x27;ve received since February.
The last one was filled with a bunch of fixes. So, what does this latest one include? Unfortunately, not all that much according to the patch notes. Apparently, several issues have been fixed to enhance the overall experience. Here&#x27;s the full rundown via Nintendo&#x27;s support page:

Those 64-core and 96-core Zen 4 processors performed phenomenally with Genoa having AVX-512, twelve channels of DDR5-4800 system memory support, higher TDP allowance, and other improvements over prior Milan(X) server processors. The other SKU that AMD sent over for review is the EPYC 9374F as their new 32-core high frequency part. For less than $5k, the EPYC 9374F is a high frequency Zen 4 32-core part with a 320 Watt TDP. Today&#x27;s benchmarks are looking at the EPYC 9374F against the EPYC 9554/9654 and various other AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable processors under Linux.</span>

It also comes with AMD&#x27;s Raise the Game Bundle, which includes copies of two upcoming games: Dead Island 2 and The Callisto Protocol (confusingly titled &#x27;The Callisto Project&#x27; by a potentially short-sighted Overclockers staffer). This is a pretty solid deal for three hundred of your Great British Pounds, especially as GTX 16-series cards were selling for this much recently and offer far worse performance.

Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it&#x27;s mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game&#x27;s scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it&#x27;s a lot of fun when you&#x27;re mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It&#x27;s a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you&#x27;d like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can&#x27;t get any better than this.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red have confirmed the release date for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt’s ray tracing-enabling Complete Edition update as December 14th. The update will also bring a number of other visual and technical improvements, as well as integrate a number of mods into the fantasy RPG, originally released in 2015. Gameplay from the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 is due to be shown off in a REDstreams event on Twitch next week, along with some new stuff for the game based on Netflix’s version of Geralt Of Rivia’s adventures.

The Easter egg was introduced along with the game’s 40th Anniversary update, which went live on Friday. Activating the secret games will let you play them in your aircraft’s cockpit, using the keys on the screen to control the plane-within-a-plane.

So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn&#x27;t call him &quot;Boy!&quot;, and also he won&#x27;t shut up under any circumstances.

To gear players up ahead of time, some more details about one of the game’s four classes have been revealed in a new gameplay video.

Modder PureDark is working together with a small team on the unofficial plugin, called Skyrim-Upscaler, and it should help bump up those frame rates somewhat. It&#x27;s available to download now from Github if you want to give it a go yourself, but there’s no plan to release the plugin publicly until the modders sort out VR compatibility.

                              <span>The future has arrived in Monkey Moon&#x27;s new narrative management game, and you can see it all the next time you go and fill up your car. At EyeLife&#x27;s Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You&#x27;ll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you&#x27;re not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They&#x27;ve got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you&#x27;re short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don&#x27;t forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I&#x27;ve only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

                              <span>The end of another Fortnite map is nigh, with Chapter 3 of the free-to-play battle royale drawing to a surprisingly early close next month. The change will coincide with the end of Season 4 in an event called Fracture, teased by devs Epic Games at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series held over the weekend. Fracture kicks off on December 3rd at 9pm GMT / 1pm PST.

Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

I feel that&#x27;s a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive&#x27;s suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.

That&#x27;s the question that filmmaker and content creator Mayuren Naidoo is trying to figure out. He&#x27;s set himself up on a mission to witness every single piece of artwork in Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the flesh, including both paintings and statues.
He&#x27;s about halfway through the list right now, having visited museums all over Europe. He&#x27;s been to France to visit the Louvre, Spain to visit the Museo del Prado, Germany to visit the Alte National Gallery, and his hometown of London to visit the National Gallery, the British Museum, and the Tate.

When it comes to karting games, you can either try something new in an attempt (and likely failure) to reinvent the genre, or you can play it safe and just take notes from Mario Kart.
Smurfs Kart has absolutely no qualms about going with the latter option, with barely a shred of originality to be found in its game design. But you know something? That isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, this decision to borrow heavily from the best — coupled with developer Eden Games&#x27; (Test Drive Unlimited) form in the racing genre — means Smurfs Kart is a decent little racer.

The nominations are out for Geoff Keighley&#x27;s yearly glamorous advertising and awards event, The Game Awards, which will be broadcast on Thursday, December 8th.
Now, we&#x27;re all well aware by this point that Nintendo&#x27;s representation on these lists is usually pretty lacking until you get to the indies and the Best Family category, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t look calamitously bad this year, even with Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarok taking up most of the oxygen in the room.

                              <span>&quot;it’s not just a quick and simple port over from mobile&quot;.
Earlier this year we became enamoured by Retro Bowl, a simple, addictive American football game inspired by &#x27;90s arcade classics from the team behind the hugely popular &#x27;New Star&#x27; mobile series. While it may have been New Star Soccer which brought the team at New Star Games to our attention in the first place, the Switch port of Retro Bowl cemented our love for its arcade-inflected gameplay and clear appreciation of classic gaming.
It was therefore with much anticipation that we heard of the team&#x27;s plans to release a football (or &#x27;soccer,&#x27; if you will) follow-up title, Retro Goal, on Switch this month — just in time for the World Cup, no less. Having previously played the title in its original mobile form, we were excited to see what New Star Games would do to ensure that the Switch port maintained all the retro joy of the original while updating things to work for its new console home.

It has been over two months since the release of Splatoon 3 and while we continue to have a great time with the game, we felt that some kind of additional content had to be imminent. Well, our premonitions have been proven correct, as Nintendo has announced a whole new batch of inky goodness will be coming to the Splatlands in &#x27;Chill Season 2022&#x27; - landing on Switch 1st December.
Outlined in the trailer above, this new content is set to introduce a whole host of features including new weapons, stages, game modes, gear and victory emotes to all those with a Nintendo Switch Online membership.

The latest most-wanted games list has been published in Famitsu, measuring the most hotly-anticipated titles according to the Japanese site&#x27;s readership. The most recent edition (using votes cast between 27th October and 1st November) saw a new frontrunner as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet overtook the consistent podium-topper The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as the readers&#x27; most-wanted game.
On the one hand, this should come as no surprise. The votes were cast in the run up to Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s release on 18th November and passion for Pokémon generally runs higher in Japan than any other location. This being said, the games have never topped Famitsu&#x27;s list (which is generally a battle between Tears of the Kingdom and Final Fantasy XVI on the PlayStation 5).

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Rogue Your Legacy.
While not the first roguelike by any means. 2013’s Rogue Legacy — alongside classics like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac — had a hand in making the now-plentiful genre the huge deal it has become. Nearly a decade later (not counting two years of early access), Cellar Door Games has finally followed up on their breakout hit. Rogue Legacy 2 builds upon its predecessor and. even for those who haven&#x27;t played the first, re-establishes what made it such an enduring hit.
Rogue Legacy 2 places you in the shoes of Lady Susie, a brave knight. As well as her descendent, Sir Judson, a boxer with gigantism and crippling IBS. Also his descendant, Sir Truman III, a chef who suffers from Panic Attacks and views the entire world as if it’s Christmas.

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

The free-to-play PvPvE survival shooter Scavengers is closing its doors. Studio Improbable confirms it will shut down Scavengers on December 16, 2022.
In an announcement, the team notes that it&#x27;s been a while since its latest update. The reason for the closure looks to be a slowly dwindling player base for the shooter.
&quot;The last few months have seen a decline in the playerbase, and whilst we explored many options to reinvigorate server population while the game is in early access, it became clear that it was unsustainable to continue development and live service,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;We’re all proud of what we accomplished, and are grateful to every player who took the time to play, even if it was just for a short while.&quot;
The studio says it plans to celebrate the next few weeks, leading up to the shutdown.

A jagged, gorgeous winter
Shown off at the 2018 Game Awards, Scavengers was originally in development at Midwinter Entertainment. The team was bought by Improbable in 2019, and Scavengers launched into an early access in 2021.
In May, Improbable sold Midwinter to Behaviour Interactive, where the team is now working on an unannounced project. A small team was left to keep Scavengers running, while the console versions were scrapped. Improbable said in a statement at the time that the cut was to help the company&#x27;s announced focus on the metaverse.
It&#x27;s a shame to see for the remaining Scavengers fans. Hopefully those who held out hope will see something they like in Midwinter&#x27;s new project at Behaviour.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a real-life Fishbones!
Jinx was already one of the most well-loved and recognizable characters on the League of Legends roster, but after the release of Netflix&#x27;s Arcane, her popularity has launched into the stratosphere. That kind of mainstream recognition usually means there are some awesome collabs on the way, which is definitely true in this case. This time around, Riot teamed up with Nerf to create a life-sized replica of Jinx&#x27;s classic blaster known as Fishbones, which was also featured in Arcane, as fans will remember.
Jinx&#x27;s Fishbones is available for pre-order now (pre-orders close January 1, 2023, and will be shipping on December 31, 2022. The gun is a gargantuan 35 inches long, and features jaws that open and close as you shoot. It holds 18 total darts, shooting out a three round burst every time you pull the trigger. Fishbones also comes with a Jinx-inspired stand and &quot;display-worthy packaging&quot; for those who want to show it off for everyone to see. The NERF LMTD League of Legends Jinx Fishbones blaster retails for $169.99, and is available for pre-order on Amazon or directly from Nerf.

The Jinx Fishbones collaboration is part of NERF LMTD, a &quot; premium, special edition, fan-focused line from the Nerf brand brings you some of the most iconic items from movies, video games, and entertainment with premium features and packaging.&quot; Other franchises that have been honored with a Nerf collab include Star Wars, Halo, Star Trek, Aliens, and G.I. Joe, just to name a few.
This has seriously got to be one of the coolest gaming merchandise crossovers I think I&#x27;ve ever seen, and absolutely something I wish I had when I was a kid. I&#x27;ve only touched League of Legends once in my life (that&#x27;s a whole story for another day), but the second Nerf releases something from a game I play, I might just have to splurge and treat my inner child.

The Street Fighter community, yer boy included, remains on tenterhooks waiting for more information about Capcom&#x27;s stellar-looking release Street Fighter 6 — In fact, some tinkerers are so eager for new action that they&#x27;ve taken to modding SF6 characters and skins directly into Street Fighter V!
The amusingly monikered modder &quot;Sleepy Scrub&quot; is currently mired in the process of adapting the skins of Street Fighter 6 for their Street Fighter V counterparts. Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Guile have already been completed, donning their slick SF6 looks, while Ken is  currently in development — though another modder, xHECZx, has seemingly beaten them to the (Dragon) punch.
No Juri yet... but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s on deck.

                              <span>Work continues on Swedish studio&#x27;s next release
Holding company Krafton has announced that it intends to acquire Swedish developer Neon Giant.
The South Korean umbrella corporation, which boasts battle royale juggernaut PUBG: Battlegrounds among its meaty portfolio, made the announcement as part of its third-quarter 2022 financial results. Neon Giant currently only has one notable title to its name — cyberpunk RPG The Ascent — but is currently developing an as-yet-unannounced first-person-shooter, set in an open-world environment.
Founded in the spring of 2018, Neon Giant was formatively made up of a party of former AAA game developers, featuring talent pulled from best-selling franchises such as DOOM, Gears of War, Far Cry, and Bulletstorm. Selected by Epic Games as one of several studios to receive a monetary grant for its first project, Neon Giant would develop and release The Ascent on PC and consoles in 2021, where it would receive moderate-to-high praise from critics and players.
With this latest acquisition, Neon Giant will join a number of western developers recently picked up by Krafton. Other purchases by the holding company include Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds and Striking Distance Studios, who are currently busy putting the finishing touches to their gory sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol.
The Ascent is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Labored with NINTENDO RULES (tm)
Nintendo has released a new demo for its madcap sports title Mario Strikers: Battle League, giving Switch owners the opportunity to check out the colorful and chaotic soccer game free of charge. The demo is available to download from the eShop now.
Nintendo had previously released a trial for Mario Strikers prior to the game&#x27;s launch back in June of this year, but that particular demo was locked to Nintendo Online subscribers. While this new demo can be accessed by all Switch users, it is still limited to Nintendo&#x27;s precious limitations. For starters, only one game of the Cup Battle feature can be played before the option is locked out. In addition, players can only experience the &quot;Quick Match&quot; feature seven times, before that too becomes inaccessible.

It&#x27;s likely that Nintendo is hoping to get more footy fans on board, given the coming of the FIFA World Cup. But it&#x27;s going to be a tough sell. While Mario Strikers: Battle League is a perfectly fine multiplayer title for anyone who wants a kickabout with pals, the full release has also been criticized for being very barebones, while also suffering from a distinct lack of major content drops/roster expansions since its initial launch. At $60, it&#x27;s a hefty ask for a game that has been particularly subdued during its honeymoon period.
Still, if you and some pals fancy a bit of goofy footballing fun, then perhaps this new demo might help to win you over. At least you&#x27;ll come away without any astro-burns, nor will you have to suffer some Big Lad blowing an air horn in your ear.

It&#x27;s that time of year again. The snow is starting to fall, as fall turns to winter, and The Game Awards are just around the corner. Today, The Game Awards revealed its 2022 nominees.
The awards ceremony itself will take place on December 8 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, CA. There will be industry members and a ticket-purchasing audience in attendance, for a night of trophies and world premieres.
This year&#x27;s nominees are led by God of War Ragnarok with 10 total nominations, followed by Elden Ring at 7. It&#x27;s not all titans though, as some indie projects got some nods too. Immortality and Neon White both picked up three nominations apiece.
Debut Indie Game and Games For Impact have some solid entries too, like Vampire Survivors and Citizen…</span>

                              <span>Roach will soon run on newer hardware
The Witcher is getting its update for newer consoles soon. The free next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been locked in for December 14.
This update will be free for those who already own The Witcher 3, so no need to worry about buying it twice. While the next-gen part points to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, CD Projekt Red also confirms it will also arrive for PC players. A physical version is also in the works for a later date.
As for what&#x27;s in the update? CD Projekt will be showcasing that next week, in a special REDstreams over on their Twitch channel. The showcase will have some details, as well as a gameplay reveal for the fancier version of this massive RPG adventure.

A shinier Wild Hunt
The next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a welcome end-of-year surprise. The project had been fairly quiet, as the spotlight had been mostly on other games like Cyberpunk 2077, which got its next-gen update earlier this year.
And I can&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;ve been waiting for this update too. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was one of the better RPGs of the last generation, especially with its excellent pair of DLC stories. I was just holding out for an excuse to hop back in, and well, this is as good as any.
It&#x27;s a good time for a Witcher refresher too, as the series has a lot on the horizon. While part of CD Projekt is working on Cyberpunk, another branch is developing the next trilogy in The Witcher series. The Molasses Flood is also working on its own Witcher project, and third-party studio Fool&#x27;s Theory is developing a remake of The Witcher, the first game, in Unreal Engine 5.

                              <span>Big Run is imminent
A big update is coming to Splatoon 3 with some new features, including a certain Big Run. Today, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for the Chill Season of Splatoon 3.
The season kicks off on December 1, and adds a bunch of new content to the third squid-kid shooter entry. New stages are in store, some old and some new, as are new weapons. Three brand-new weapons (for Roller, Charger, and Shooter) are joined by 10 returning weapons from the Splatoon series.
For competitive players, the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 will see the return of X Battles. These are special ranked lobbies that you can only access once you&#x27;ve hit an elite rank in Anarchy Battles. Once there, you can risk special points to compete in these X Battles. It&#x27;s like an extra level of ranked to compete in, for even higher bragging rights.

Born to Big Run
On the PvE side of things, the co-op Salmon Run mode is also seeing the debut of its Big Run mode. The Big Run has been teased in previous trailers, but it&#x27;s a special in-game event that will bring the chaos of Salmon Run to a normal multiplayer map.
The first Big Run will kick off with the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 as Salmonids invade the Wahoo World stage. That&#x27;s not very wahoo of them.
More info is on the way as to how this changes Splatsville, and how to play in this specific mode. But for the co-op fans, this seems like a big update, alongside what the competitive players are getting.
The Chill Season update will be available for all Splatoon 3 players with an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription.

                              <span>Likens release to &#x27;a global playtest&#x27;
Morio Kishimoto, designer and game director at Sonic Team, has suggested that the recent release Sonic Frontiers still has much room for improvement, noting that the developer will continue to work on the title now it is out in the hands of players worldwide.
In a pretty candid tweet posted Friday, (and translated by VGC), Kishimoto admitted that the new sequel features &quot;areas where we are not quite there yet&quot;, and said that the development team would be taking player feedback seriously, &quot;like a global playtest&quot;. Kishimoto notes that he envisions Sonic Frontiers becoming one of the series&#x27; most important titles, ultimately shaping the future of the long-running franchise.

Launching November 8 on PC and consoles, Sonic Frontiers has, like most of The Blue Blur&#x27;s games, been a divisive title, running the gauntlet of high and low scores from both critics and players. While many have praised the high-speed sequel&#x27;s visuals and mechanical overhaul, the title has been criticized by some for its combat, &quot;boring&quot; environments, and bizarre juxtaposition of colorful, cartoonish characters with somber, monolithic enemies.
Regardless, Sonic Frontiers has seen launch success. Over on the Steam platform, some 19,181 concurrent players were recorded at the game&#x27;s launch, beating the previous series record — held by 2017&#x27;s excellent throwback Sonic Mania. Whether Sonic Frontiers has the staying power to become the iconic release envisioned by Kishimoto remains to be seen, but this early admission that the title still has some way to go before developers will be pleased with the product does not go down smooth .
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a few!
So Tactics Ogre: Reborn is out now on multiple platforms, including Switch. Thankfully, some folks (like solwhitehorn on Reddit) have tinkered around with it, and found that it has mouse and keyboard support: yep, on the Nintendo Switch!
That got me thinking: it would be great to have a list!
Which Switch games have mouse and keyboard support?
Tactics Ogre: Reborn
Doom 1 and 2
FUZE4
Hypnospace Outlaw
Factorio
Monster Hunter Rise (text input only)
Mouse and keyboard support has been a thing for generations of consoles now; and the most notable games I can think of that helped usher it into the mainstream spotlight were Phantasy Star Online for Xbox, and Shadowrun 2007 (the shooter). The latter was a really interesting experiment that pitted PC and Xbox players together via cross-play, ages before it became a major thing in the console market.
In any case, one of my favorite things about the Switch is the ability to swap to different control schemes. The Wii in particular was very inflexible, with many games forcing a singular type of control; and while the Wii U was better with a lot of titles allowing for Pro Controller support, the Switch has improved things even further.

Real history is an interesting setting for games to use. Pulling in actual world events to tell a tale can be tricky, but Pentiment does it in stride.
Pentiment is a passion project from a small team of developers within Obsidian. It’s set in the tiny town of Tassing in Bavaria, in the late 15th and early 16th century. It’s a town with clear divides between the peasants and their fields, the townspeople’s crafted goods, and the double monastery looming just down the lane.
Every villager, sister, and monk in Tassing has a story. Each family has branches that grow out and interlock. It might seem too small a place to keep a secret. But as protagonist Andreas Maler soon discovers, those appearances are deceiving.
It’s a combination of history and detail, alongside a fan…</span>

Ring the bell, sound the horns: the curtain has fallen on the Pokemon x Splatoon 3 splatfest — And now that the ink has finally dried and the result is in, we can see that Team Water has taken victory in the age-old battle of the Pokemon starter elements.
Over the past weekend, squid kids and octolings took to the messy battlefields of Splatoon 3 in order to stand up for their favorite starting Pokemon types — with playing taking up arms for Grass, Fire, and Water. Incredibly, Team Water came away with a perfect 45p score, meaning that the H2O lovin&#x27; squaddies ultimately won out in both Open and Pro battles, as well as winning the public vote.

This is one of the cleanest (no pun intended) sweeps in recent Splatoon history, and suggests that the Pokemon x Splatoon crossover community either really, really likes Water-type Pokemon, or that they simply converted their love of the wet stuff to fantastic in-game plays.
You can check out the full results below.
Public Vote
Team Grass: 25.80%
Team Fire: 33.60%
Team Water: 40.60%
Clout (Open)
Team Grass: 33.41%
Team Fire: 32.75%
Team Water: 33.84%
Clout (Pro)
Team Grass: 33.59%
Team Fire: 30.55%
Team Water: 35.86%
This special splatfest was, of course, held to help promote the release of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, both of which launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch on November 18. This event also represented the second splatfest result of the multiplayer shooter&#x27;s new era. So, if your team took a drubbing this time around, it won&#x27;t be too long before you can lock &#x27;n&#x27; load for another weekend of gooey competition.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s long-anticipated release God of War Ragnarok finally hit shelves last week, and has already smashed all previous day-one sales in the long-running fantasy series — In fact, the first 24 hours of sales saw Ragnarok shift more copies than its 2018 predecessor achieved in its first week of release.
&quot;God of War Ragnarok will debut at No.1 [in the UK Charts] and is the first cross-gen title in the series,&quot; said Gfk&#x27;s Dorian Bloch in comments made to GamesIndustry.biz. &quot;Day 1 physical sales were already greater than any other full-week launch sales for other titles in this franchise.&quot; Bloch also notes that 55% of PS5 hardware sales this past week consisted of God of War Ragnarok bundles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g1wr0DfV73E
Launching on PS4 and PS5 on November 9, God of War Ragnarok sees a world-weary Kratos, accompanied by his fast-maturing son Atreus, embark upon another brutal odyssey across Scandinavia, preparing themselves for the coming of Ragnarok, the foretold event that will bring death to Gods and devastation to the land.
While some critics and fans have criticized the new sequel for its length and some frustrating &quot;hand-holding&quot; NPC dialogue, Ragnarok has received mass praise across the board for its spectacular visuals, compelling characters, engaging combat, and operatic approach to storytelling. Clearly more than worth the wait, Kratos and Atreus&#x27; latest head-chopping jaunt is clearly in contention for many critics and players&#x27; Game of the Year award, and is already set to be one of 2022&#x27;s best-selling releases.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.

More than eight years ago and over the space of just a few months, Halton Powell&#x27;s &#x27;Droidsticks&#x27; brand and associated Kodi add-on package were known all over the UK.

                              <span>Brazil says blocking measures to tackle the rise of pirate IPTV services and devices are coming soon. In the meantime, a new system of fines will apply to suppliers and users alike. The government has other plans which appear to render all TV boxes illegal by default, pending official approval. And if anyone modifies an approved device or &quot;uses it incorrectly&quot;, that&#x27;s an offense too.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

Good morning, friends and witnesses, and welcome to this week&#x27;s Whatcha Been Playing? May I start out by thanking everybody for their very, very kind birthday wishes last weekend.

What really made it special, however, was the kindness shown to me here, in the Qposts, and on Twitter, so thank you.
I hope that your November has gotten off to a rollicking start, and as the year starts wheezing to its conclusion, I hope that November offers up some great memories — gaming or otherwise — to carry you into the coming holiday season. Go out and end this year with …</span>

                              <span>Who you got?
Publisher 3goo is currently gearing up for its rerelease of the cult 2D fighter The Rumble Fish 2 — Launching on PC and console platforms December 8, this release represents the 2005 scrapper&#x27;s first-ever home appearance on the global market, filling in a long-standing gap for fight fans everywhere.
In order to get newcomers on board with the DIMPS fighter&#x27;s weirdness, a new trailer spotlights the 13 characters that make up the roster — the titular &quot;Rumble Fish (2)&quot;, as it were. These range from your standard bad-boy martial arts experts such as Zen, Lud, and Aran, to bizarre outliers such as child fighter Mito, young scribe Typhon, boxing shark dude Bazoo, and Cheeseburger in paradise-looking MF&#x27;er Boyd. Of course, sexy secret agent Sheryl is in the mix as the requisite waifu bait.
Check out the whole gang in the video below. See if you can spot your mains.

Limited Run Games currently has pre-orders open for physical editions of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch platforms. The fighter is available as a standard boxed edition for $34.99 USD, while a Collector&#x27;s Edition, retailing for $64.99, includes an art book, strategy guide, command cards, a CD soundtrack, three additional DLC characters, plus a digital download for the first Rumble Fish release. Currently, this Collector&#x27;s Edition is the only way to purchase the 2004 original.
The Rumble Fish 2 launches December 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Something delightfully novel for this week&#x27;s Arcade Archives entry as Hamster pulls &#x27;80s alien blaster Baraduke out of its big bag of Namco games and gives it a fresh release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released to the coin-op market in 1985, Baraduke, (aka Alien Sector), sees intrepid space explorer Toby &quot;Kissy&quot; Masuo picking her way through a series of claustrophobic interplanetary caverns, taking on an army of gooey aliens and gathering up cute, cycloptic creatures known as &quot;Paccets&quot;. Once all of the stage&#x27;s enemies are destroyed, our hero ventures down a large connecting pipe to confront one of a number of boss guardians, before heading on to the next zone.

Fascinatingly, despite its relative obscurity, Baraduke predates Nintendo&#x27;s legendary release Metroid by a full year, though it contains several similarities to the classic NES title. Not only does Baraduke feature a labyrinth of alien-created caverns, linked by a series of metal tubes, but the Namco game also reveals its woman protagonist as a &quot;surprise&quot; at the game&#x27;s climax, much like the coming of Metroid&#x27;s Samus Aran.
Baraduke would be followed up by little-known sequel Bakutotsu Kijūtei in 1988, before the franchise effectively ended. Hilariously, in deep Namco lore, it is said that Baraduke protagonist &quot;Kissy&quot; eventually married and divorced Dig Dug protagonist Taizo Hori, with one of the pairing&#x27;s children being Susumu Hori of Mr. Driller fame! Someone call Kevin Fiege, I want to see a Namco Cinematic Universe!
Baraduke is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

                              <span>With a &quot;gaming&quot; rocking chair
My Nintendo has been rolling out a fair few prize pack giveaways this year, and just finished out the Rabbids: Sparks of Hope promotion. Now it&#x27;s onto something new: what Nintendo is calling the &quot;Family Fun Holiday&quot; prize pack.
You know the drill at this point. You can &quot;enter&quot; the contest with a deposit of 10 Platinum Points, with up to three entries (so 30 points in all). If you have points to spare, you may as well throw them into this: especially if they&#x27;re expiring!
Here are the prizes:
A gaming rocker chair (you choose between Mario, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, or Luigi)
A 15 inch mega-plush Mushroom
A 1-Up glow in the dark Switch wired controller
A 1-Up glow in the dark Switch case
While many contests tend to be first party games releasing at the time (like Kirby): this one smartly rolls with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;fab&quot; Mario squad.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

Zombie Hunter looks like a fake game. You know the opening of No More Heroes III where Travis Touchdown outlines this weird Deathman game, and the gamer part of your brain tells you that such a game couldn’t exist in the time period it’s supposedly from? That’s Zombie Hunter. It tells me it’s from 1987, but doesn’t really tell me it was developed by Lenar. Instead, it just mentions Hi-Score Media Work Corp, which was sued out of existence by Enix over a screenshot of Dragon Quest 2. I know this, because the first thing the game does upon being started is scream at you, “Hai Sukoa!” It was a nice jumpscare to start the game.

That&#x27;s a lot of UI
Just look at it. Half of the screen in Zombie Hunter is taken up by its HUD. It’s excessive! Then you actually start mo…</span>

Trauma is different for everyone affected. It can look different, and the person can wear it differently. He Fucked the Girl Out of Me doesn’t overtly say this but seems to understand trauma like, well, someone who has dealt with it for a long time.
Selected by the International Documentary Film Festival of Amsterdam for their DocLab exhibition, He Fucked the Girl Out of Me is both difficult and important to talk about. Part of the difficulty is it’s an 18+ game with an F-bomb in the title. It gets filed right next to the games about big-breasted androids. Any site that reports on it runs the risk of getting a weird look from the robots that run the internet (breast-size unknown).
It’s a free game, so developer Taylor Mccue is…</span>

I feel like the whole &quot;mini console&quot; craze was custom made just for me. As someone who was alive when these systems were ushering in a new era for video games and a collector: it&#x27;s just a perfect match.
Nintendo was on a roll there with the NES and SNES &quot;Classics,&quot; but after the PlayStation effort, things kind of quieted down. Thankfully, Sega has just given us their second Genesis/Mega Drive mini, and if this iteration is any indication, I wouldn&#x27;t mind of they kept going.

Here&#x27;s everything you get with the box:

                              <span>You had me at &quot;dark fairytale&quot;
With Stardew Valley being one of my most-beloved and most-played games of all time, I am constantly on the hunt for the next game that can scratch my farming/community simulator itch. There have been quite a few that I&#x27;ve written up over the past few months, and the newest title to add to the list of hopeful successors is the sandbox life sim RPG, Kynseed, which has been described as a &quot;Stardew Valley-inspired game with &#x27;dark fairytale&#x27; creatures.&quot; Yeah, sign me up.
The game has been in early access since November 8, 2018, but it&#x27;s finally getting its official release on December 6, 2022, as was announced in a newly-dropped release date trailer. Fans who have followed Kynseed all through its development are beyond thrilled to see the game nearing its completed state, as can be seen in the comments sections of its trailers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JU4rSiixt_Q
The release trailer showcases the usual fare for these kinds of games, like farming, cooking, and fishing, but things really get wild once they dive into the combat. Fighting off monsters looks a lot more intense than the slow-paced combat of Stardew, with more of a strategic, turn-based thing going on. I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate combat mechanics a lot since I had a big Stardew binge a few years ago, so I&#x27;ll be interested to see how Kynseed&#x27;s spin on things continues to evolve the simulator genre.
Oh, and did we mention that the developers behind Kynseed are industry veterans from the classic Fable series, now under the new banner of PixelCount Studios. Based on what we know of the game so far, it seems like they&#x27;ve injected this new project with all of the character and whimsy we can expect, so this is definitely one I&#x27;m looking forward to checking out on release day.

Kevin Conroy, the prolific voice actor who portrayed Batman across film, television, and video games, has died after a short battle with cancer. He was 66.
Conroy began his acting career on the stages of New York and San Diego after attending The Julliard School, where he studied alongside Christopher Reeve and roomed with Robin Williams. He performed on Broadway, did Shakespeare, and made the rounds on television, popping up in some of the biggest shows of the &#x27;80s. A celebrated actor, it was his command of his voice that would see him hit new professional heights when he was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman: The Animated Series.
Arguably one of the greatest television shows of all time, Batman: The Animated Series reintroduced the Caped Crusader to the Satu…</span>

                              <span>But where&#x27;s Lupin III?
Nacon has announced the arrival of a new DLC expansion for its robo-revolutionary RPG Steelrising — T Cagliostro&#x27;s Secrets story expansion is available to purchase now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, priced at $14.99. The new gameplay can be accessed once the player has completed the &quot;Bastille&quot; mission.

Cagliostro&#x27;s Secrets throws a little more heavy metal action in the divine Aegis&#x27; path. The DLC includes a new area, Hôpital Saint Louis, which features a new questline and several brand new enemies, along with variants on some of Steelrising&#x27;s already established mechanical nightmares. In addition, the DLC drop adds five new weapons to our girl&#x27;s arsenal of death, and includes several brand new side-quests that can be found and completed in Steelrising&#x27;s other districts.
While Steelrising was not quite the gemstone it might have been, I still found it a gorgeous-looking and very challenging adventure, that rose above its budgetary shortcomings thanks to its classy visuals and in-depth combat mechanics. While certainly not for everyone, the ambitious adventure is a sign that, as a developer, Spiders is growing with each successive release, and I hope that a future sequel could really deliver upon the game&#x27;s compelling premise.
Steelrising is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Fantasy series debuts December 9
Netflix has announced that its upcoming animated series based on the sword &#x27;n&#x27; sorcery of Dragon Age will finally make its debut next month — Dragon Age: Absolution will premiere on the streaming service from December 9. The studio also released a brand new trailer to get fans&#x27; hype engines in gear.
Set in the lands of Tevinter, Absolution will follow the fable of Miriam, a former elven slave who is forced to throw off her shackles and rise to become the fearsome warrior that she was always destined to be. Across each of the show&#x27;s six episodes, we will journey with Miriam as she meets a party of noble and ignoble allies, confronting the tragedy of her past and forging a better future for herself, her people, and Tevinter itself. The show will feature the political drama, interpersonal relationships, and epic interspecies warfare that have made BioWare&#x27;s gaming franchise such an enduring hit with RPG fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;X7MZuR8RM48
The six-episode series has been written and produced by showrunner Mairghread Scott, previously responsible for the writing of several animated series within the Marvel Comics, Transformers, and Star Wars universes. Dragon Age: Absolution stars a cast of talented voice actors including Kimberley Brooks Ashley Burch, Phil LaMarr, Matt Mercer, and Sumalee Montano. Hopefully, this fresh dose of olde wurlde action will satiate the fanbase as they wait eagerly for BioWare&#x27;s to wind up work on the highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
Dragon Age: Absolution premieres exclusively on Netflix December 9.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel&#x27;s development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
&quot;Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday,&quot; Pershing writes. &quot;He&#x27;s been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend.&quot;

                              <span>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a pretty bleak game, but it’s also really good! It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

                              <span>Dave the Diver (character) is a bit out of practice, but he&#x27;s an easygoing sort and it doesn&#x27;t take much to convince him to get back in his flippers to look into the local anomaly at the behest of his arms dealer &quot;friend&quot;, who would be clearly bad news even if his name wasn&#x27;t Cobra.
Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it&#x27;s visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra&#x27;s sure it&#x27;ll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It&#x27;s certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

                              <span>Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

Until now, thanks to a Special Edition mod that slows down time when arrows are flying towards your mightily voiced fantasy warrior. Enabling the Projectile Sense – Incoming Arrow &amp; Magic Slows Time mod should give you just enough advance warning to hotfoot it out of the path of any pointy ended sticks that have been loosed and are heading your way.

And I was like, &quot;Sure!&quot; and toddled off to have a look. I was delighted! But I think Katharine was anticipating it would arouse a different emotional response in me to what it actually did, because she used the word &quot;horrifying&quot;.

They’re targeting the subscription service market, together with the start of Battlefield 2042’s upcoming Season 3: Escalation in December, bringing the game to both EA Play and Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate. Of course, EA Play is included in regular PC Game Pass, so there&#x27;s that. You can find out more by watching the development update video below.

                              <span>Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to place Dark Souls 2 in your crosshairs and take aim at its differences. Its map doesn&#x27;t intertwine like Dark Souls 1 or 3. Lots of bosses do that thing where they summon in some mates and it&#x27;s quite annoying. The atmosphere lacked that magic glaze. And yet, its quirks and frustrations make it one of my favourites.

                              <span>I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

                              <span>Lunistice is a 3D platformer inspired by the PSX/Sega Saturn era, but its high-speed movement reminds me of Sonic’s 3D adventures, in a good way. Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It&#x27;s now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it&#x27;s been time well spent.

This week we&#x27;re talking about games that make us feel like proper cool people, just like you - who, I emphasise again, are a very cool person. Matthew is not cool enough to be here this week, but I am joined by Nate, who is the king of cool (and crabs).
There&#x27;s a Cavern Of Lies to test Nate&#x27;s coolness, and we check in with Henry &quot;The Vit&quot; Cavill, but first, of course, we must litigate the different kinds of cool we feel, what counts as cool, and which games make us feel the coolest.

Players have forged remakes of classic Halo maps and entirely new designs that give us a peek at what’s possible in the engine. If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo feature that allows players to create and edit their own maps and modes, leading to some of the most fun experiences in the franchise. Let’s take a look at the community’s creativity.

                              <span>I’m of the strong and perhaps completely nonsensical opinion that any game is better when it’s set on an island. School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong. Check out the trailer below.

Former US President Abraham Lincoln and Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II are clearly visible in the artwork. Alongside them are Ngola Nzinga of Ndongo, and someone wearing a ruff that I’m going to have to assume is either Queen Elizabeth I or Mary, Queen of Scots, because That Hair. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

                              <span>Last night’s Nintendo Indie showcase gave us fresh looks at many exciting indies. Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, ZA/UM - the studio that developed Disco Elysium - confirmed the reasons several employees were fired last year. These include &quot;limited to no engagement in their responsibilities&quot;, &quot;creating a toxic work environment&quot;, &quot;verbal abuse and gender discrimination&quot;, and attempting to sell ZA/UM&#x27;s IP to other companies.

Still, it’s one to take with a pinch of salt, which probably wards off the undead too. There’s been no word from devs Arkane on whether rumblings of a Redfall beta are legit yet, but The Game Awards are only a few weeks away so we might see something announced there.

                              <span>Say what you will about Square Enix&#x27;s ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix&#x27;s enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you&#x27;re a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it&#x27;s your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that&#x27;s more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony&#x27;s long-dead handheld, where it&#x27;s lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I&#x27;ll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

As that’s less than a week away now, it’s a good job there’s loads of info about everything, from the game’s battle pass overhaul to the incoming story-based DMZ extraction mode.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series&#x27; premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.</span>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.
First, we had to reserve a time to enter that particular…</span>

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

MindGeek defeated the pirate site in court and also secured more than $32 million in damages. The verdict comes after the court previously denied a broad injunction that required hosting and CDN providers to take action as well.

Today, Hellspy and Hellshare are still going strong but after months of negotiations with local TV companies, significant change lies ahead. More serious problems with the music industry could derail everything.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we&#x27;ve looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLEDs are brilliant gaming displays at any size - and the 42-in and 48-in models are just small enough to fit onto an average to large-sized desk. That technically makes them &quot;cool gaming monitors&quot; and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton &amp; Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon (&quot;FLASH25&quot;) that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we&#x27;ve ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

                              <span>Composer Mick Gordon has published a rebuttal to an open letter by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton concerning Doom Eternal&#x27;s soundtrack. Stratton&#x27;s post was written all the way back in May 2020, and Gordon&#x27;s response is a doozy. “Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the DOOM Eternal Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure,” Gordon said in the post on Medium. Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

                              <span>More than 11,000 workers at Meta will lose their jobs, the technology company has announced, a figure that includes some staff working in its VR team Reality Labs. The Company Formerly Known As Facebook broke the bad news to employees via a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared earlier today. The job losses equate to 13% of Meta’s entire staff. Redundancies will affect staff across Meta’s global offices, including here in the UK.

                              <span>I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

Having previewed both Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Wild Hearts, I&#x27;ve come to discover that the mark of a great boss is one of these things, none of the rest, and 500 pounds of ham. BIG PIGs are in, and they are here to do a high-pitched squeal and charge to the top of the &quot;Trending Bosses&quot; list.

                              <span>Praise the Sun! FromSoftware have announced that Dark Souls Remastered’s long dormant PvP servers have been reactivated at last. The fantasy action RPG’s multiplayer was scuppered earlier this year when a security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing online was discovered all the way back in January. PC servers for Remastered were taken offline until a fix could be found, along with every other Dark Souls game.

They’re also touting more frequent updates to an FPS game that’s been relatively Spartan in terms of content, so far. Another game update is planned for later in 2022, which means Halo Infinite players can almost certainly expect something in December.

Valve are currently testing new expanded modding features in TF2, letting modders play with the VScript feature supported by games including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Left 4 Dead 2. While it&#x27;s not yet clear what will happen, a proof-of-concept video mashing in wallrunning, swish grappling hooks, and pilotable mechs suggests great potential. Come watch!

The intention to conduct an in-depth investigation was announced in a statement on the European Commission’s website, and will focus on how the deal will affect console and PC games, along with PC operating systems. This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it&#x27;s both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

                              <span>If your favourite PC games are competitive shooters, then a high refresh rate monitor is an essential upgrade in my eyes - the reduced input lag and improved visual clarity makes a huge difference in games like Counter-Strike, Valorant, Fortnite and Call of Duty. 144Hz and 165Hz monitors used to be the norm, but now even faster monitors are becoming quite affordable - including this 280Hz Acer monitor that&#x27;s dropped to £180 at Laptops Direct, down from an original price of £275.

                              <span>Rhythm games lose something when they don’t come bundled with a peripheral, I think. There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

                              <span>Speedrunning charity event Awesome Games Done Quick is returning in January, and there’s plenty of PC runs among its freshly announced preliminary schedule. Notable standouts this time around are PowerWash Simulator, which might well be my personal GOTY contender, and a bonus appearance from cutesy cyberpunk cat sim Stray. There’s also a Google Stadia run of nautical indie action-adventure Wavetale, just a week before the streaming platform closes for good.

                              <span>The other week I played a short demo for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game&#x27;s special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

                              <span>Blacktail is a complicated, first-person adventure when you play a lil witch. Well, a witch in training, sort of. A witcheen. Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It&#x27;s a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you&#x27;re dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you&#x27;re an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don&#x27;t think that will change.

Wordle will be programmed and tested just like the NYT’s Spelling Bee and Crossword.

                              <span>Get your chainsaw guns, body armour and chin-fluff at the ready, because the unstoppable assault of Netflix video game adaptations has found a new target. The Coalition’s Gears Of War series of beefy blastermen fending off equally beefy aliens is coming to the red streaming service at some indefinite point in the future, it’s been revealed. Netflix say they’re working together with The Coalition on producing both the movie and animation.

                              <span>Activision have not-so-clarified that next year’s annual Call Of Duty release will be a “full premium” one. The shotgun blast of marketing speak erupted from the company’s third quarter earnings results for the year, setting off car alarms, shattering glass, and triggering journalists’ Google Alerts. You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

                              <span>How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they&#x27;ve passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children&#x27;s pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

You probably also noticed that BioWare shared some concept art of an in-construction mass relay from the next Mass Effect game, along with a snippet of jumbled audio for people to download. Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

Raspberry Pi Pico powers a tiny little 602 LCD display and three keypads. A level shifter converts the voltage between the Pico and the LCD display. The maker is still working on the code. They built this replica […]

                              <span>Ebay&#x27;s TAKEIT10 code offers a 10% discount on a wide range of PC components and peripherals, but I was tickled by this deal on an Integral 480GB SSD, which brings this sizeable drive down to just £24. 
That&#x27;s a solid £5 below the price of the same drive on Amazon, and well into bargain buy territory for anyone that wants to cheaply and easily add more storage to their desktop or laptop. If you have any old laptops that are still running on hard drives, for example, then this could be an awesome low-cost upgrade!

This little gadget has a simple premise: fifteen customisable keys, each with a little LCD screen behind it, that can be bound to accomplish a wide range of things from scene switching in OBS and monitoring your computer&#x27;s vitals to launching programs or muting your microphone. Normally the Stream Deck costs £150, but today it&#x27;s down to £90 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Compared to many of the latest FPS offerings out there, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fossil. It&#x27;s such a simplistic looking game, right? A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it&#x27;s more refined than basically any of its competitors.

                              <span>I, like many people I know these days, will only watch a YouTube video if it&#x27;s either less than 5 minutes or more than an hour long. YouTube evolved a while ago into a platform for long-form video essays, and I for one am happy about it. Even better: Jenny Nicholson just released an almost four hour video on an uncompleted attraction in Utah called Evermore. Evermore is a sort of theme park-slash-immersive-theatre that appears to have been beset both by uncontrollable world events and bad management, but I still want to go because it looks pretty fun(ny). 
I did think about what games I would like to become immersive experience theme parks in this kind of vein, though, and I gotta say... I&#x27;m coming up empty.

                              <span>Fantasy roguelike Dead Cells is being invaded by indies again. Weapons and outfits from six games are making their way into the game with today&#x27;s free Everone Is Here 2 update: Terraria, Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Slay The Spire, Risk Of Rain 2, and Katana Zero. There’s also new lore rooms based on locations from these games, which is where you’ll find the weapons stored. You can watch some of the costumes and weapons in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer - not including Warzone 2.0 - brings out the best of COD&#x27;s excellent gunplay on an array of colourful maps that largely deliver. And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn&#x27;t make it an athletics competition.
And while the game&#x27;s multiplayer is a slick refinement of what&#x27;s come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve got the game installed on an SSD...

If you are in the market, you could thefore find, say, a list of the best early Black Friday gaming keyboard deals very useful indeed. Hey, here&#x27;s one.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023. Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.

                              <span>There’s a war going on between instalments in the Battlefield series, and it looks like Battlefield 1 is coming out on top for now. The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it&#x27;s since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon.

A few hours after posting the teaser, a fan decoded the background audio to reveal a conversation between what sounds like Liara and the Geth. BioWare has acknowledged this breakthrough by releasing a new version of the clip with clean audio. You can listen to it in the tweet below.

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s premium broadcasters use conditional access systems to restrict viewing to paying customers and prevent piracy. These systems are reportedly very good but that&#x27;s making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”</span>

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with &quot;H&quot; and both their last names start with &quot;K.&quot; Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…</span>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…</span>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…</span>

The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.

This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM

Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.

You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
