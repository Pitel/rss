                    <span>Players have had plenty of time to dive into Halo Infinite’s multiplayer experience, but as we move closer and closer to the December 8th launch date, anticipation has been building for the campaign experience as well. After weeks of throwing around the oddball and hacking up competitors with the sizzling sword, is it time to take the campaign trek? Well, here’s the first big trailer from the campaign, unveiled today.

FPS campaigns often range from the mundane to the majestic and we don’t know just where Halo Infinite’s falls just yet. Clearly, much has changed since the underwhelming demo slice of legend that gave rise to big-time internet memes and a fair amount of concern about what the final game would play like. That said, we’ll be looking closely to see what the verdict is as we get closer to launch. While multiplayer hasn’t been without issues, especially ones related to battle pass progression, game customization, and more, overall Halo Infinite’s “return to form” for Halo seems to be well received thus far. Take a look at how the campaign has changed from its initial reveal to now in the video below!

There’s not a whole lot you can extrapolate from a trailer like this except “get hype”, and with a game like Halo, you’re already probably either onboard for what this new campaign experience is poised to serve up or unlikely to be swayed by what’s on deck here. Where do you stand, Spartan? Are you ready to blast off in the new campaign or are you passing on it entirely? If so, are you still in for the free-to-play multiplayer part of the experience?

                    <span>Endwalker, the upcoming expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is almost here. In fact, players with early access packages can begin playing the expansion as soon as Friday, December 3. Of course, as with any MMORPG launch (and many other online games), the first few days are likely to be dicey affairs when it comes to server queues, login woes, and other various assorted issues as players all attempt to login at the same time and play. We saw this happen earlier this year with New World – and seeing it occur in some capacity for the Endwalker launch would not be unusual, given the hype for this big, big expansion that features several new jobs and a ton of new content to explore.

                    <span>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, the other, other video game based on the popular tabletop game currently in development, has been delayed. It was tentatively set to release in February but is now launching on May 19.
It may be easy to confuse Swansong with the other two Vampire: The Masquerade games also in the works: Bloodhunt, the battle royale launching early next year that&#x27;s currently playable in Steam Early Access, and Bloodlines 2, the long-awaited sequel to the 2004 game that had its development rebooted. Swansong is a choice-driven narrative RPG that puts you in the role of three vampires in modern-day Boston. 
A new leader has emerged to take control of the city’s sect of vampires, triggering a violent power struggle filled with twists, turns, and betrayal. Each playable vampire hails from a different clan and sports its own unique powers, which can be customized to your liking. Many of those skills influence characters to pry information out of them, using techniques such as persuasion and intimidation. Check out the game’s teaser trailer below.

In a tweet, developer Big Bad Wolf Studio says the delay will allow additional polish to ensure the game’s quality while also letting the team maintain a healthy work/life balance.  Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                    <span>Techland has announced Dying Light 2 Stay Human has gone gold and is ready for production, two months ahead of its scheduled release date. 
The company spread the news to Game Informer through a press release, saying the team achieved this milestone over the weekend. Techland&#x27;s press release also had some words from Tymon Smektała, lead game designer on Dying Light 2. In it, he speaks about how the work on the game isn&#x27;t quite done yet, saying, &quot;The fact that the game is done and we hit the gold status two months before the release is a great sign but it doesn’t mean that our work ends here. There are still some upgrades and tweaks to add, and community feedback to implement, but the base is solid and ready to play.&quot;
So, while much of the work is in the rearview mirror, there&#x27;s plenty to tweak and fix before the public is finally able to play it. Still, the feat of shipping a game is a massive undertaking and one worth celebrating. Tymon says, &quot;I’m extremely proud of the whole team!&quot; Considering the ups and downs the project faced over the course of a long development process, he should be. 
The next time we&#x27;ll see Dying Light 2 Stay Human is just around the corner. This Thursday, Techland will premiere Episode 5 in its Dying 2 Know series, where about 15 minutes of new gameplay will be shown. You can find that at 12 p.m. Pacific on Techland&#x27;s Twitch channel.
Dying Light 2 Stay Human is well on track to hit its February 4, 2022 date to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch (cloud version), and PC. For more on Dying Light 2, check out Brian Shea&#x27;s recent preview where he played four hours of the game.</span>

                    <span>For many of us at Game Informer, Halo Infinite&#x27;s free-to-play multiplayer is a blast that feels nostalgic and refreshingly new at the same time. However, a point of contention (one that&#x27;s also been shared by the wider Halo community) is the monotonous grind of accumulating XP points. Infinite&#x27;s progression system leaves a lot to be desired, and leveling tends to be a painful slog. Initially, 343 Industries implemented an update to give players longer durations for XP boosts (among other features). Today&#x27;s new update goes a step further and increases XP payouts for the first six matches of each day. 
After seeing how XP was earned with those changes, we noticed that players were starting their sessions with slower payouts than we&#x27;d like. To address this, we will be increasing the XP payout …</span>

                    <span>For a slightly more cerebral platforming experience.
The Switch has a lot of platformers, and a lot of puzzle games, and that extends to puzzle platformers. If you&#x27;re raising your eyebrows and saying &quot;what are you on about, you can&#x27;t just combine them like they&#x27;re ice cream flavours&quot;, then stick with us. It&#x27;s a thing, we promise.
Rather than games focused purely on running and jumping accurately, or just using your noggin to find clever solutions, these games combine the two to rather charming effect. Often you&#x27;ll take pause at points to plot a way forward, combining skill with intellect. Puzzle platformers also often have a strong approach to storytelling, making them a relatively impactful experience when at their best.

                    <span>&quot;The very best version of the very best games console&quot;.
Last week, we spoke about the debut episode of the new season of the UK video game show GamesMaster – and today sees the release of the second episode.
It&#x27;s full of good stuff once more, including a unique challenge in which a winner of a Golden Joystick in the original 1990 run of the show returns to claim a second trophy in the brutally diffcult Cuphead – but of particular note is this week&#x27;s review segment, which focuses on the recently-released Switch OLED Model and Metroid Dread, the game it launched alongside.

                    <span>Watch the teaser here.
Tomorrow, a brand new season will get underway in Pokémon GO, and developer Niantic has already given us a quick tease as to what we should expect.
It&#x27;ll be called the &#x27;Season of Heritage&#x27;, and as any Pokémon fans reading will likely pick up on themselves, the art and wording appear to be hinting towards a Pokémon Legends: Arceus tie-in. With that game (which will take players on a journey through the Sinnoh region&#x27;s past) launching on Switch in January, it&#x27;s certainly the right time for such an event.

                    <span>Get swole.
The Animal Crossing: New Horizons update, which came out on the 5th of November, added a ton of new stuff to the game. We&#x27;ve already covered a lot of it, from gyroids to cooking, but one of the cool new features is the ability to engage in some of the activities your villagers do, like dusting, reading, and carrying drinks.
Most of these new items can be obtained either through Redd&#x27;s raffle on Harv&#x27;s Island, or bought from Nook&#x27;s Cranny. But did you know about the tiny dumbbell you can get, too?

                    <span>Pre-orders open this week.
While a lot of games battle to be the stand-out in familiar, popular genres, you sometimes get a game like The Procession to Calvary that&#x27;s perfectly happy to be its own bizarre self. A point-and-click game with absurd humour (and certainly some Monty Python-esque vibes), it has some flaws but we nonetheless described it as &quot;one of the most amusing and unique video games we&#x27;ve played in some time&quot; in our review.
For those that&#x27;d like a physical edition to add to their collection, that chance is coming. Red Art Games is handling the distribution and sale of it, planning to open pre-orders on its official store on 2nd December at 8am Pacific / 11am Eastern / 4pm GMT / 5pm CET. The Switch version will be €29,99 with regional variations (€5 higher than the PS4 version, unfortunately), with 2800 copies being produced.

As well as highlighting some of the eShop&#x27;s best digital games, the newsletter also includes a couple of features that talk about game development and spotlight specific titles – such as DigixArt with Road 96, and Lienzo with Aztech Forgotten Gods.

                    <span>Fixes include stopping it raining indoors, of course.
Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, to give it the full name, had a rocky launch plagued by numerous bugs and a negative reaction from a lot of players. Rockstar and developer Grove Street Games has had to handle that fallout, and has already released two patches to try and address issues.
Now another update is rolling out, and based on the official changelog it&#x27;s aiming to fix a range of issues such as rain occurring indoors, grass clipping into buildings and a broad range of other glitches and issues.

In the three clips below, Game Director Maurice Hagelstein and Game Designer Tom Erenstein give us an insight into the game&#x27;s character creation process and how the studio arrived at the style present in the final build. They also discuss their gameplay design philosophy, giving us a glimpse of what players can expect to enjoy when XEL launches next year.

Huntdown is a rather fun and bombastic retro-style run and gun, as you battle through heinous criminal gangs and face off against increasingly tough bosses. Now, as if it wasn&#x27;t tricky enough, there&#x27;s a free Arcade Mode update that&#x27;s just gone live on the Switch version.
It&#x27;s taken a little while since its arrival on Steam, but the development team shared the good news recently.

                    <span>Definitely better late than never.
Back in the early &#x27;90s Westone, best known as the creators of the Wonder Boy / Monster World series, were supposed to release a cute and colourful arcade game — Clockwork Aquario. Unfortunately for them the cutting edge polygonal thrills of Virtua Racing were busy setting the arcade world alight at the time, making their cheerful 2D platformer look a lot like a relic from a bygone era. As a result of this and other struggles the project was quietly mothballed before release and the idea abandoned — until now.
It’s this long journey to completion that makes Clockwork Aquario stand out from all the other retro and retro-inspired releases on the Switch. It’s not another dusted-off classic you’ve already played before or something made to resemble the style of 1993’s best and brightest but a true brand new-old release, and as such it crackles with a special sort of energy normally only found in games made a long, long, time ago, usually found sat in the corner of arcades far, far, away.

                    <span>Not bad for a console nearing 5 years old.
In a little over three months&#x27; time, the Nintendo Switch will have been on the market for five whole years. Despite that, the system has just enjoyed its best-ever week in the UK.
That&#x27;s according to GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s Christopher Dring, who reports that &quot;last week was the biggest sales week ever for Nintendo Switch&quot; in the region. Dring explains that Nintendo&#x27;s Black Friday console bundle, which included a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a three-month Switch Online subscription, helped the system to reach new levels of success.

Recent weeks and months have brought a lot of attention to allegations of misconduct at Activision Blizzard, with a leaked email from Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser reacting and explaining that &quot;every company in the industry must create an environment where everyone is respected and treated as equals, and where all understand the consequences of not doing so.&quot; The allegations and related court cases have led to multiple major gaming companies making commitments to strong ethics and governance in how they work, and Nintendo has emphasized this further in a series of additions to its latest Corporate Governance Report.
This document expands on Nintendo&#x27;s previous statements and goals around encouraging a diverse and inclusive workforce. It goes further than the original report, also providing transparency on the number of women in management positions in the company.

Atari are releasing Sid Meier&#x27;s classic Command series on Steam tonight, so you&#x27;ll be able to get your hands on Decision In The Desert, Crusade In Europe, and Conflict In Vietnam. They&#x27;re a vintage bunch of RTS games that make you a commander in various wars, you know, if wars were about controlling tiny little blocky tanks in a bright blue desert.

                    <span>In the last few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time looking through scopes. Red dots and ACOGs and telescopic ones. From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s tactical FPS Rainbow Six Siege ushered in Year 6 Season 4 today. Named High Calibre, it introduces new defensive operator Thorn, who&#x27;s special gadget is a sticky grenade that explodes into razors when it detects an enemy. Ouch. The other big change with this season is a rework of the Outback map, which cleans up a lot of junk to improve sightlines, and help attackers strategise.

                    <span>“Play against type,” Sin Vega advised in her well good piece on getting the most out of strategy games. I’m sorry Sin. I failed. Tactical RPG Wartales gave me the opportunity to promote a wild boar to the captain of my troupe of wandering mercenaries. I did not. Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

Clarity Boost, as they call it, aims to make games look better through some client-side processing fanciness. The feature is currently only supported in a test version of the Microsoft Edge browser, planning to roll out to regular Edge soon.

                    <span>Though Halo Infinite launched in decent shape (our Ed called it &quot;the most stable FPS I&#x27;ve played all year&quot;), one bone of contention has been the slow pace to unlocking things on the battle pass. The developers, 343 Industries already boosted progression pace, but evidently that wasn&#x27;t enough, and now they&#x27;re coming round for another pass at the pass. From today, they&#x27;re planning to offer bonus XP for the first six matches you play every day.

Developers Big Bad Wolf have delayed Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong into May 2022. They say the extra three months will help ensure their team keep a healthy work-life balance, while having more time to add polish and go through QA.

CDPR had previously said Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s next-gen console update would be out by then, but confirming another big patch for everyone then too is news. Not big news, but welcome news, especially considering how many new players the game has picked up since going half-price in Black Friday sales.

                    <span>We’re a year after release and the PS5 is still hard to find, which means  the consoles already out there are a hot commodity. Sadly, this has led to a heated resale culture around the machine, and even more sadly in this case, it has resulted in a 19 year-old being shot when trying to sell one.

                    <span>Destiny 2 has a reputation for being convoluted and obtuse, even among live service games, and things are about to get even worse when it comes to its expansions, with integral parts of the game arbitrarily paywalled behind old products.

                    <span>Antstream Arcade is now available on the Epic Games Store, boasting over 1000 games to stream to your PC. We learned of its inclusion in the launcher through a story from the folks over at PC Gamer.
The streaming service has all kinds of games from the arcade, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, SNES, and many more. While the Antstream is free to download and access, gems or a subscription will be needed to play anything. Epic is offering a welcome pack available for free until Thursday for new players to check out the service, which provides 1090 gems to mess around with. Most games cost 30 gems per play, though, for the price of $39.99 a year, you can play any solo or co-op game without having to pay extra.
Antsteam features additional benefits to those playing on its platform, including achievements and challenges. Tournaments are also available, pitting your high scores and feats against others in games like Mortal Kombat, Dig Dug, Chain Reaction, or Marble Madness. Winning or scoring highly in these contests will payout in gems to spend on other games or enter future tournaments.
There looks to be plenty to check out with Antstream Arcade, with many cool old arcade and console games to try. I&#x27;m eyeing some of the SNK and Commodore 64 collections, myself. Keep in mind that you aren&#x27;t downloading any of these games, so making sure you have a strong network connection will be critical for an optimal experience. Along with the addition to the Epic Games Store, Antstream Arcade is available on PC, iOS, and Android devices.</span>

                    <span>Strategists ready to return to the battlefields of World War II have the chance to play in the Company of Heroes 3 pre-alpha multiplayer test starting tomorrow. 
A video from developer Relic Entertainment, featuring principal producer Morain McLaughlin, details some aspects of Company of Heroes 3 players can expect to play around with during the test. While the final product will include more factions (including the Italian battalion, which will be detailed next year), players will get their hands on the American and German forces. Each military force will feature two battlegroups to explore, replacing the doctrines and commanders from previous games. These battlegroups will offer a tree of abilities, units, and upgrades to select and utilize throughout a match.

The pre-alpha test will primarily be a multiplayer-focused affair, but those who wish to take on the computer-controlled AI in 1v1 or 2-player vs. 2-CPU have the option to do so. If you&#x27;re playing by your lonesome against the CPU, you&#x27;ll have access to the tactical pause feature not present in modes with more than one person. 
Other new features available will be outfitting vehicles with side armor, a veterancy system, and verticality in maps. Relic promises more updates in 2022, including new factions, units, and mechanics to be revealed over the coming months.
Preloading is available right now on Steam for established COH-Development account holders. Anyone new to the COH-Development program can head over to the game&#x27;s community site and sign up for an account there. Company of Heroes 3 is aiming for an unspecified 2022 release date for PC.</span>

                    <span>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, the sci-fi strategy adventure game by Vanillaware (makers of Odin Sphere and Dragon’s Crown), is making its way to Switch on April 12. The game has only been available on PlayStation 4 since it launched in March 2020. 
The game blends side-scrolling visual novel adventure with real-time strategy. Players control 13 ordinary high school students who also pilot giant mech suits called Sentinels. Okay, so they’re not that ordinary. The story primarily revolves around stopping an invasion, but the sci-fi tale branches in all sorts of wacky directions, many of which draw inspiration from stories like War of the Worlds and The Terminator. While you’ll use your mech to defend the world in RTS battles, the real meat of 13 Sentinels is navigating the intertwining, non-linear narratives of the students. Each teenager has their own story arc, and you’ll jump back and forth between them all to uncover the entire bonkers storyline. Take a look at the Switch announcement trailer below for an idea of what to expect.

In our review of the PS4 version, we scored 13: Sentinels an 8 out of 10, with former GI editor Joe Juba describing it as a “fun and ambitious experience that combines high-school drama and huge robots in a (mostly) beautiful package.” You can read our full review here.

                    <span>With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to release in just a few weeks, producer Amy Pascal has revealed that we’ll be seeing more of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. 
Pascal said No Way Home is not the last Spider-Man movie Sony Pictures Entertainment is making with Marvel Studios in a new interview with Fandango. She also revealed that Holland’s next movie will be the first in a new trilogy. 
“This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel – [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,” Pascal told Fandango. “We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel. We’re thinking of this as three films, and now we’re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.”

                    <span>If you’re struggling to make meaningful progression in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, which launched early as a separate free-to-play package, you’re not alone – 343 Industries’ head of design feels your pain. 
343 head of design Jerry Hook tweeted about a game called Len’s Island and then replied to that tweet to explain that he was playing both Len’s Island and Halo Infinite’s multiplayer. He said he’s feeling everyone’s pain in terms of progression and that the team is working on it, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be the top of my list with the team.”



Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be top of my list with the team.
November 28, 2021
As you can see in Hook’s tweet above, work on multiplayer’s progression continues to be a top priority for 343 Industries, which is likely also head down on the Halo Infinite campaign that launches on December 8. One important aspect of the entire discourse surrounding the multiplayer progression is that the game is still technically in beta. 
Yes, 343 Industries is selling a battle pass that costs real money in it and it’s fair to want that battle pass to feel fair, but this beta period for multiplayer was likely enacted for this very reason: to get a feel of the community’s thoughts on it and progression, and make changes based on those feelings ahead of the full December 8 launch.

For now, read about how 343 is investigating Halo Infinite’s battle pass progression and then check out this breakdown of the recent changes made to it. Be sure to read up on what you can unlock in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer this week after that.

                    <span>End Global 7, a coop company composed of prominent development studios, released a Q3 2021 Investor Presentation that detailed revenue/financial gains and a project pipeline for future IPs. The information packet revealed Dimensional Ink Studios, the team behind DC Universe Online, is working on another MMO. However, this time, players will be suiting up as created Marvel superheroes and (potentially) supervillains. The new Marvel MMO is currently in development, but the unexpected announcement is exciting nonetheless. 
According to the slide entitled &quot;Exciting Product Slate for 2022 and Beyond,&quot; Dimensional Ink Studios is coming off a solid year with DCUO cornering the market for successful superhero-based MMOs. The studios&#x27; most popular title is celebrating its 10th anniversary and &quot;performing near its peak historical annual revenues.&quot; Under the &quot;medium-term&quot; banner (seen above), a graphics overhaul and massive content expansion are in the works and slated for a 2023 release. 
However, under the &quot;longer-term&quot; banner, an unannounced MMORPG is underway. The important bullet points read as follows:
Marvel IP based massively multiplayer online game
Being developed by Dimensional Ink Studios in Austin, TX
Led by Jack Emmert, who designed and helmed City of Heroes, and currently leads DCUO
It&#x27;ll probably be a long time before we get any notable info about this new Marvel MMORPG. Still, based on Dimensional Ink Studio&#x27;s pedigree, we can expect to see fun customization options, beloved heroes and villains to interact with, and exciting leveling systems with raid scenarios. 
In other news, a bunch of  games featuring beloved Marvel and DC characters are around the bend. Be sure to check out Marcus Stewarts&#x27; Wolverine, Suicide Squad, And The League Of Upcoming Superhero Games piece to learn more.

                    <span>Update, 11/29/21:
Deck Nine has revealed the new release date for Life Is Strange: True Colors on Switch after being delayed back in September. 
Initially set to release in September alongside the other versions of the game, True Colors was delayed to a later unannounced date, putting less pressure on the team for the release of True Colors. Deck Nine has revealed that True Colors will hit Switch digitally on December 7, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. The physical release of it on Switch won&#x27;t happen until February 25, 2022, though.

                    <span>Escape the tower.
Though December can sometimes be a quiet month in terms of major retail releases, it&#x27;s likely to serve up a number of tempting smaller titles. One that may deserve a spot on the wishlist is Aspire: Ina&#x27;s Tale, which arrives on 17th December priced at 12.99 USD / 12.99 EUR / 10.29 GBP.
As you can see in the trailer it could offer some excellent visuals and audio, and the storyline also sounds interesting. Developer Wondernaut Studio looks to have produced some puzzle platforming along with the storytelling angle:

                    <span>&quot;[Nintendo] know that that’s the right way to go&quot;.
We&#x27;re all still waiting for Metroid Prime 4, and yes, that sucks. However, the game&#x27;s prolonged development is indicative of Nintendo and Japanese companies as a whole, according to former Retro Studios staffer Jack Mathews.
Mathews served as the Lead Technical Engineer on the Metroid Prime trilogy and has been speaking to the Kiwi Talkz podcast about their development.

                    <span>A Killing Game for your wallet.
As we&#x27;ve established previously, Danganronpa is pretty skeevy in its narrative. Thankfully, though, it has managed to avoid bringing said skeev outside of its world, outside of the fictional space that makes it somewhat more palatable. Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp, unfortunately, rather breaks that promise.
The &quot;bonus game&quot; element of the Danganronpa Decadence package (though also available separately), Ultimate Summer Camp is an expansion of a post-game feature from Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, the strangely-titled &#x27;Ultimate Talent Development Plan&#x27;. Here, you&#x27;re presented with a similar board game structure; pick a character from the casts of all four games (yes, even the insipid and un-ported Ultra Despair Girls) and take them out onto the tiles — literally — rolling dice, playing cards and watching your stats shoot up.

                    <span>A real Class act.
Everything was leading up to this. Danganronpa. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. The anime Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak High School. Even the god-awful, mercifully not re-released for Switch Ultra Despair Girls. It has all lead to Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, the crowning achievement of the series and, quite frankly, one of the best visual novels ever produced.
There’s no avoiding this, so we’ll lead with the fact that V3 is a contentious, challenging game. Some will scoff at the idea of something so avowedly crass having any higher-minded ideas at play, but Danganronpa V3 – more so than any other video game we’ve ever played – is a work of autocriticism, an existential piece of thinking that has its cake and eats it quite gleefully.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

                    <span>Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she&#x27;s written a message on the palm of her hand reading &quot;He is alive&quot;. I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

                    <span>Gamesplanet is the next in a long line of vendors to post up its seasonal offerings - now into its second week of Xmas deals. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year&#x27;s festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that&#x27;s where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

                    <span>Earlier this month, Platinum Games held a closed beta for their upcoming action RPG, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that&#x27;s because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

                    <span>It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

                    <span>Storage. Its something most of us don&#x27;t think about until its too late. &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll just download this other game for later&quot;, followed by your computer yelling at you that there&#x27;s no space left. Cue me legging it to Argos for another overpriced drive. Not to fear - for those of us more prepared than I am, there is a whole host of options available, not least of which are these stylish Samsung T7 SSDs.

                    <span>Rejoice, Oculus Quest 2 bargain hunters. The 128GB version of Oculus&#x27; standalone headset is now down to £249 for Cyber Monday, knocking £50 off the price of the headset. We&#x27;ve only spotted the deal at Amazon at the moment, but the good news is that they&#x27;re still running the £50 / $50 credit voucher promo in additon to the headset saving, which means you save a total of £100 if you buy one today.

                    <span>They Always Run is the closest I’ve come to living out my dream of being a galactic bounty hunter. It’s a 2D platformer with two distinct halves to its gameplay. One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer beta has only been out for a couple of weeks, but the free-to-play FPS doesn&#x27;t have effective anti-cheat, and it&#x27;s really beginning to show. Players have been posting clips on social media of supposed cheaters using wallhacks, aimbots and more. Now Xbox Halo players are asking developers 343 Industries for an option to turn crossplay off, so they don&#x27;t have to deal with pesky PC hackers.

                    <span>It may be below freezing outside, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our hard working PCs will keep as cool. Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it&#x27;s vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.
Thankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.

That news comes from a new financial presentation from Enad Global 7, the parent company of folks include DCUO devs Dimensional Ink Games and DCUO publishers Daybreak. What actually is the Marvel MMO? A secret, for now. But I wouldn&#x27;t feel wrong making some assumptions.

                    <span>Welcome to Cyber Monday, gang. While today usually marks the last chance to jump on any lingering Black Friday deals, there can and will be some shiny new savings on PC gaming hardware as well – hardware like the Gigabyte B550M DS3H, a microATX motherboard that’s dropped into prime territory for first-time builders on tight budgets.


Amazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.

CETIN tak reaguje na zvyšující se nároky spojené zejména se stále rozšířenějším využitím cloud computingu, videokonferencí či streamování – prostě všech aktivit, které vyžadují posílení uploadu. Zájemci o tyto nové tarify je mohou získat od poskytovatelů, kteří danou akci využijí, zrychlení ovšem není automatické a záleží na nabídce providerů, píše CETIN v oznámení.</span>

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series, and this episode is set to wrap our talk on Retro Studio&#x27;s epic trilogy of Prime with a detailed discussion of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. 
Released on August 27, 2007 for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is often considered one of the best games on Nintendo&#x27;s unique motion sensing console. During today&#x27;s show we talk about what made 2007 such an phenomenal year and why we Prime 3 often gets overlook in the shuffle. We also talk about how Prime 3 might be the best entry in the Prime series thanks to it innovative motion controls and the Hypermode system, which allowed Samus to dish out some serious damage. Finally, we speculate if Samus is just an intergalactic version of Batman.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, lead community producer at Twitch Zach Ryan (@ZachariusD) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Well, chums, Black Friday itself has been and gone. I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.

                    <span>As those of you who have been hiding behind my sofa, or just read our “What are we all buying this Black Friday?” article, are aware, the top item on my Black Friday shopping list was a new chair. I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.

Luckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free. You do have to buy a laptop first though.

                    <span>Around this time last year, I put out a call for headset recommendations, looking for something cheapish and not terrible. An Internet Friend offered me an old set and I gratefully accepted, not being in the position to turn down free stuff. A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears. Using it is like having an angel gently hug my head while they whisper game noises in my ears.

Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that the SteelSeries Arctis headsets are very good and you should totally check out the SteelSeris Arctis 7 deals we have featured below the jump.

                    <span>Rest up, reader dear. The most important day of year is almost here: Cyber Monday. And it&#x27;s likely to be a big one! I do not know why so many of the megacorps now celebrate the day dedicated to all those cyberpunks who fight against injustice and corruption every day of their lives, but it&#x27;s a day which deserves recognition. So rest today and play some games in-between polishing your mirrorshades, dusting off your leather, and preparing a fresh boot disc. On Monday we hack the planet, but what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>If you buy the yearly iteration of your favorite sports video game, chances are you haven’t had much to cheer about the last few years. To put it bluntly, the genre is struggling, and even the new console generation hasn’t been the answer to rejuvenating it. Take just this year, for example. Metacritic scores are anything but impressive for the biggest sports around. Madden NFL 22 earned an abysmal 60, NHL 22, which promised to change its metagame, disappointed with a 74. NBA 2K has largely been the franchise to beat, but NBA 2K22 only holds a 76, some of the lowest marks the series has seen in years. FIFA 22 and MLB: The Show 21 earned the highest averages, around 78, but it’s telling that none of these franchises could even crack the 80 mark. 
This downward trend has been going for some …</span>

                    <span>The holiday gifting season is fast upon us, and many of us have kids in our family or friend groups who are hoping for something fun wrapped up to enjoy. Beyond gift-giving, if you’ve got a family of your own, you may be trying to come up with ways to keep yourself and the kids entertained over the holiday break from school. Either way, I can say with confidence that a good family board game is worth its weight in gold, both for keeping everyone happily entertained, but also ensuring some fun shared activities to make memories.
The board gaming hobby has no shortage of wonderful family games, but I’ve kept the focus here on mostly newer projects that you may not have heard of. As you consider which game might be right for your family group, make sure and check against the age recommendatio…</span>

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>With winter just on the horizon, this is the last entry in our Fall For Indies series. So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of 2021 and beyond.
A Heaping Serving Of Fall Releases
The last leaves are falling, but there’s no shortage of indies to serve up, as the upcoming feast has many appetizing courses. The Pathless, an action-packed adventure from the creators of Abzû, the brilliant roguelike Death’s D…</span>

                    <span>From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan&#x27;s dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there&#x27;s a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn&#x27;t create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.
You can take a look at all of the comic characters that were a part of a season or an event below:

                    <span>When you think of Disney today, there’s a good chance either Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to mind. That’s not surprising either – it’s the two properties Disney pumps the most time and money into. 
In games, it seems as if Disney exclusively pours resources into them – yes, there’s Kingdom Hearts, which has been great for decades but it seems that series is heading into a decidedly less Disney-based future – and it’s a shame because the nearly 100-year-old company has so much to offer to the video game space, both to classic fans and new ones alike. That’s why Disney needs to tap into its history.
I love a good Star Wars or MCU flick, and I, for the most part, love a game set in a galaxy far far away or in a Marvel-based timeline. But let’s be honest: we almost always k…</span>

                    <span>This holiday season, maybe you&#x27;re traveling. Maybe you&#x27;re not. Maybe you&#x27;re going to be stuffing massive quantities of turkey into your craw, with handfuls of stuffing and cranberry gobbler sandwiches for weeks of high-quality leftovers. Perhaps you&#x27;re just hanging out with a can of carbonated water and a good video game. Whatever you&#x27;re doing, the holidays can be full of hustle and bustle, stress, good times, and everything else – so it might be time for an idle game. A game you can boot up, make a few decisions, and then either return to it five minutes later, five hours later, or even five days later. Good idlers, also known as &quot;clickers&quot; since the genre primarily began with games that took tons of tapping or clicking alongside idle economy and resource management, can be tough to find.…</span>

Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

                    <span>As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there&#x27;s one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn&#x27;t win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever played.

                    <span>Typically, I&#x27;d associate Google Docs with work, and any form of spreadsheet with even more work, but indie game developer &quot;droqen&quot; has made me reassess that outlook. He&#x27;s the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing.

I know that it’s Actual Black Friday and I’ve had a bit of a rubbish week and coming up with new openers to these deal highlights is starting to get a bit difficult now.

It doesn’t even matter that this is RPS and Baron James von Hardware-Editor is quite happy to let me make all the puns I like (well, don&#x27;t test me - J). I have standards and that means I will not make the obvious Crucial joke.
Actually I will. It’s Crucial that you check out these fantastic portable SSD deals.

                    <span>Before Black Friday I considered harnessing its powers to my own benefit, by upgrading from my current, increasingly defective and technically stolen chassis. Now I may have found that new case, and I’m willing to share: it’s the NZXT H710 and it’s a healthy £40 off.

                    <span>I&#x27;d say call your family, but do we not all view phonecalls as deeply suspicious now? My phone is a glass-and-silicon brick for displaying text that makes me unhappy.
It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve found ourselves here, looking at some indie games, and once again I have been drawn to some that are a little melancholy, but in a sort of healing, wholesome way. I&#x27;m not sure if that says anything great about my state of mind right now, but hey - the nights are drawing in, there&#x27;s a bit of a nip in the chip, and it&#x27;s the time of year when we&#x27;re encouraged to think about family, found or otherwise. And who in their 30s doesn&#x27;t get sad thinking about that.

                    <span>When the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise arrives in January, it will include all the post-launch content released so far on Switch, Capcom have confirmed. Yes, this includes the weird Sonic The Hedgehog crossover which launches today. So when the game finally comes our way, it&#x27;ll be both larger and sillier.

                    <span>This week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang is, once again, all about the big releases. Battlefield 2042&#x27;s in a bit of state, so we talk about the many patches scheduled to fix it up. We&#x27;ve also heard that those banned in Call Of Duty: Vanguard will be banned across the entire series, which is nice. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer surprise launched and Outriders DLC appears out of nowhere too. Imogen rounds off the news with her Apex Legends ranked update. Has she reached the platinum dream?

It might not be as big as Steam&#x27;s sale (check out our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations) but GOG&#x27;s games are (mostly) DRM-free, and many of their good discounts are the same. Deals include 90% off Shadow Tactics, half-price Cyberpunk 2077, 80% off The Witcher 3 GotY... yeah, these will do nicely.

                    <span>I recently spent a couple of weeks with the Roccat Pyro as my main work and gaming keyboard, and it was a lovely bit of kit for the price; full-size mechanical keyboards rarely cost under £100, yet here was one that started at £90 and had everything a typical PC gamerist could ask for. Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.


For such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. 


Sadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.

                    <span>If you enjoy carefully constructing a lineup of warriors in games like Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train, here&#x27;s a surprising recommendation: play Super Auto Pets. The free-to-play auto-battler reminds me much more of those games than the likes of Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics, focused on building and arranging a line whose abilities will compliment each other. And for something so cute and simple-sounding, it has a delightful amount of buildcrafting. Even the F2P monetisation is good!

                    <span>Black Friday is here. There are only deals. Deals on games. Deals on monitors. Deals on graphics cards, in the sense that they’re slightly less of a rip-off. The deals converge, parting the clouds and blackening the sky until but one shines through: £110 off the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. Hey. That’s pretty good.

                    <span>The Apocalypse came, and it was a shambles. The angels, you see, the divine powers, they did not anticipate that the world had changed, and instead of a hundred million people still impressed by hot food, they had to deal with 8 billion who had long since invented the AK47, and when the holy fires came, humanity tooled up.
This is how the Sin Collector Colon Repentless starts. I am enjoying it a great deal.

                    <span>Is there anything better than sitting down to a big feast, surrounded by friends and family on Thanksgiving? Yes. Absolutely crushing a culinary rival before sitting down to that feast. Which is why, this year, I sparked up a totally friendly cooking competition with Game Informer’s resident Instagram chef, Brian Shea. Of course, I have no cooking skills. Even the least flammable foods turn to fiery ash as soon as I enter the kitchen. But that doesn’t matter because I have a virtual ace up my sleeve.
I’ve been putting Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ newly introduced stove through its paces, growing crops, stealing techniques from villagers, and gathering all possible ingredients to whip up some mouth-watering dishes. So, instead of a fair fight that I’d lose, I challenged my fellow editor t…</span>

                    <span>Thanksgiving Day used to be the start of the holiday shopping season, and the parade Macy&#x27;s holds in the middle of New York City every year is designed to promote the biggest names and brands you&#x27;ll be hearing about for the next month. Given how big of an industry video games have become in the last 40 years, you&#x27;d think every other balloon in the show would feature a memorable Nintendo or Sony character hovering down the chilly street. Surprisingly, that&#x27;s not the case, and only a handful of characters and games have had the honor to join in the festivities. We&#x27;ve collected them here in one place for you to gawk at, and have ranked them for your enjoyment.
Here are all of the video game balloons featured in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade over the years:

                    <span>Solar Ash represents a dramatic leap forward for Heart Machine. After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.
In Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus. Given that Solar Ash takes place in a beaut…</span>

                    <span>With Thanksgiving upon us, there are two types of people out there: the person who’s been thinking about the upcoming turkey meal since November 1 or the person who jumps straight to the winter holiday of Christmas, Hanukkah, or something else. Regardless of where you land, there’s a good chance that you’ll be eating some kind of breakfast, lunch, or dinner with family and friends sometime in the next two months. 
These meals can be fantastic, but they can also be a nightmare for those that hate these typical family gatherings. The same can be said for family gatherings and meals in video games, and we’ve gathered up some of our favorites. Here are 10 of the best family meals in video games.

                    <span>Thanksgiving sucks. It&#x27;s the one time of year you see all those family members you spend the other 364 days of the year avoiding. You know, the cousin that&#x27;s way into NFTs and meme stocks. The uncle who listens to the Joe Rogan Experience and somehow finds a way to reference it at every drop of the hat. It&#x27;s all just exhausting. 
And that doesn&#x27;t even get at how bad turkey is. Turkey is like the Bunny Bread of meats. Dry, flavorless, and gross. Thanksgiving is a problematic holiday for many reasons, but I think turkey is the cherry on top of this crap sundae. How have we made such a bland, ugly bird the centerpiece of this entire annual tradition? Don&#x27;t get me started on those weird things under turkeys&#x27; chins. I find it unfathomable that people eat these creatures.

                    <span>When Halo: The Master Chief Collection was announced in 2014, fans were excited at the prospects of bringing forward the mainline Halo series to the brand new Xbox One with myriad enhancements and ways to engage with the multiplayer. Unfortunately, the launch of the compilation, which originally included Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4, featured several problems surrounding the multiplayer suite and The Master Chief Collection seemed like it was well on its way to being one of the cautionary stories of unfulfilled potential within the games industry.
The disappointing launch, underwhelming feature set, and broken matchmaking could have been the way we look back on Halo: The Master Chief Collection in 2021, but developer 343 Industries wasn&#x27;t satisfi…</span>

                    <span>It’s 4pm on Thanksgiving Day. You’re probably stuffed with turkey right now, or in the process of stuffing yourself with turkey, or still waiting to stuff yourself with turkey. (If you ate ham, get the hell out of here.) You know what that means? It’s time to make hats!
Making turkey hats is an old Thanksgiving tradition. It’s not hard to see why; turkey hats combine two of our favorite things: food and fashion. Hats also make your head look bigger, which will convince people that your brain is huge.

People who wear hats are often the life of the party. Need proof? Check out this picture of Spock.

Boy what a boring guy. Now, what if we throw a hat on him?

Instant party animal! You too can be this guy. But instead of making the traditional Turkey hat for Thanksgiving, why not make a hat …</span>

The arrival of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign is imminent. To get you ready for December 8, we sat down with the team at 343 Industries to learn everything we need to know about the upcoming return of Master Chief.


Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, and a lot has changed since we last saw the Xbox icon. The UNSC is fighting for its life on Zeta Halo, The Banished are getting closer to completing their nefarious goals, and humanity once again hangs in the balance. Some of those tropes may sound familiar, but 343 is here to tell you why Chief&#x27;s new story should have fans excited. Quick SPOILER warning: We discuss where the characters are and some of their motivations headed into Halo Infinite. If you want to go in clean, come back to …</span>

I&#x27;ve been impressed by the 1v4 multiplayer horror game, watching it steadily grow into one of Steam&#x27;s most popular after a while looking like it might slip a way, so that&#x27;s a nice get. But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild. You know, you can skip guns and just play that as a very pretty walking simulator.

                    <span>Keyboards are one of, if not the most, integral part of a PC set up. Second only to the monitor. Therefore, finding a good one is imperative - especially for anyone spending long stints gaming while using said keyboard. Within the stellar range of gaming keyboards on offer, there are a few different types: ones with lights, mechanical, compact, wireless - I could go on. The beauty of Fnatic&#x27;s offering is that it covers most bases, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.

                    <span>Katharine and I went hands-on with Babylon’s Fall last week, that online action RPG by PlatinumGames which falls in and out of memory as the years tick by. Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.
As it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.

                    <span>Warhammer 40k has a bunch of interesting gods, and I have to say my least favourite is Nurgle. He&#x27;s a big plague monster that infects everything with grossness, and uh oh, he&#x27;s the big bad in the upcoming turn-based tactical RPG Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters. Developers Complex Games have released a new dev diary talking about how his minions will bring plague across the land and, admittedly, it looks quite cool. But also: yuck!

                    <span>This week, based almost entirely on the fact that we have been enjoying Rio Tropicale (other fizzy drinks are available) the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is doing an episode all about our favourite drinks in games! We didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d manage to get a whole show out of it, but boy did we.
Also tune in to learn about Matthew&#x27;s new (and extremely one-sided) rivalry with an Olympic swimmer, a cavern of lies featuring bar tender Ed Harris, and a digression so self-indulgent we talk about how self-indulgent we are, and decide that it is a good thing.

                    <span>Recently, I’ve moved out of the city and into a little village in the middle of nowhere. Look outside the window and I see trees, maybe a little house nestled atop a hill. I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.
Yeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.

It has the gorgeous pixel art and presentation of a classic tycoon game, as well as all the simulation aspects you’d ever want. But buried under that business management exterior is a game equally interested in exploring moral choices, and one that leaves me thankful it pauses before I have to make a decision.

                    <span>Amazon Studios are &quot;nearing a deal&quot; to develop a TV series based on Mass Effect, according to a recent Deadline report. Excellent stuff. I&#x27;m all for it! If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I&#x27;d much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they&#x27;d follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don&#x27;t think we need to see more of Shepard&#x27;s side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.

                    <span>After releasing Battlefield 2042 in an unready state, Dice today took a step towards fixing and finishing it by releasing a wee patch which tweaks weapon balance and fixes some bugs. Bullet spread on all guns except shotguns is reduced, for starters, making them more accurate. The ludicrous hovercraft is less murderous too. And they&#x27;ve wiped out bugs including one which left players stuck downed, unable to respawn. Read on for more.

It’s a lot like treating yourself to a digital feast, and given that Thanksgiving dinner is, scientifically speaking, the perfect assemblage of food, there’s only one way to determine the best combination of games you can play.

                    <span>After the first series of Resident Evil movies made over a billion dollars in box office revenue, production company Constantine Films is ready to reboot its biggest film franchise. But where the original series deviated drastically from the source material, new director Johannes Roberts – known for his work on 47 Meters Down and The Strangers: Prey At Night – wants to do right by Capcom&#x27;s original games with his new film, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. We caught up with Roberts, to ask what it&#x27;s been like bringing the first two games to life.

Game Informer: What is your relationship with the Resident Evil series?

Halo Infinite is having a big few weeks. On top of the free-to-play multiplayer suite launching ahead of the full game&#x27;s release on December 8, Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure is also the focus of the latest Game Informer cover story! And what&#x27;s a cover story without a brand new Rapid-Fire interview with the one and only Joseph Staten?
Join us as we sit down with 343&#x27;s head of creative to discuss all things Halo Infinite in our patented scorching-fast style. Joseph was kind enough to put up with us for 117 questions that span everything fans will want to know about one of the biggest games of 2021. In true Rapid-Fire fashion, we have plenty of questions centered on getting to the bottom of Halo Infinite. Who is the Weapon? Will there be new maps and firearms added to the multiplayer suite as time goes on? What happened to Chief and Cortana after the events of Halo 5?
It also wouldn&#x27;t be a Rapid-Fire without some questions you probably wouldn&#x27;t think to ask, like what kind of broadway musical does Chief listen to while slaying The Banished and saving the universe? You&#x27;ll get the answer to that question and so much more during this exclusive interview that you can find above!
Is the wait for Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign feeling too long? We understand and want to help you through this time with our exciting new cover story! This month, we&#x27;re diving into a ton of new and compelling interviews, gameplay videos, and more from the team behind the next entry in Master Cheif&#x27;s story. Be sure to check out our quick looks at the game&#x27;s opening level, our campaign impressions, learn more about exploration and progression, and our look into the creation of the devious bots from the earlier versions of the multiplayer test flights. Thanks for watching, and let us know what you thought of the video in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Children of the ’90s may remember the surge of enthusiasm surrounding Pokémon Snap’s N64 release. Unlike other popular Pokémon titles up to that point, it offered the chance to catch creatures not with a Poké Ball but with a camera. The game featured rushing rivers, sunny beaches, and dark caverns, all stuffed with familiar specimens. The most skilled players snapped – to our young minds – unbelievably realistic shots of these roving Pokémon in their natural habitats while the ever-moving vehicle pushed onward. But it wasn’t enough to capture wild pictures of our favorite creatures. We needed to share these works of art with the world.
Short of parading friends past the home console to admire our digital albums, there didn’t seem to be a good way to do so. Enter the Pokémon Snap Station. I…</span>

                    <span>You&#x27;ve probably seen a million lists online about pairing wine with food or wine with music, hell, even wine with movies. But where are the wine pairings for video games? To address this absence, we talked with master sommelier Morgan Harris about what types of wines go best with which games.
Before we start, we should note that wine and game pairing isn&#x27;t an exact science. Pairing wine with food often results in chemical interactions that enhance or alter flavors; this doesn&#x27;t happen with game pairings, obviously. &quot;Fundamentally, wine is a grocery which means it doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of structural overlaps with gaming, which is a leisure activity,&quot; Harris says. &quot;At their base, they&#x27;re very different things, but there is certainly some overlap and both of them are designed to give plea…</span>

                    <span>Every year, when the daylight wanes faster than I’d prefer and the air chills to bitter cold, I retreat from any outdoor activities and turn to the warmth of my computer. That’s where I sink deep into my chair, crack open some sodas and junk food, and boot up my chosen genre to escape the harsh months of Minnesota weather. It’s when I’m most at home diving deep into a good MMO.
Each winter is a new opportunity to explore another facet of the vast worlds I’ve explored many times before. Usually, my go-to MMO is World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing on and off since 2005. Maybe I never hit the current level cap on the last character I was playing, and that’s my jumping on point, or a new expansion is releasing, and I want to get caught up on the juicy lore and character moments leading …</span>

                    <span>How does a video game from another region make it into your hands, and how do companies ensure you’re getting an experience that lives up to the original? As the gaming industry becomes more globalized, video game localization is an increasingly pertinent topic. But few people actually understand what goes into the process. Preparing to release a game in a new country or region comes with many challenges that go well beyond simple translation.
When a game is localized well, it’s free of typos and grammatical errors, the dialogue is natural, and the instructions make sense. But even this is skimming the surface of the localization team’s role in the process. As games become more complex and text-heavy, not only do the challenges continue to grow, but the quality bar – and our expectations –…</span>

Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.
What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.
What do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

Halo Infinite&#x27;s free multiplayer experience offers many avenues of play, including timed events. This week, 343 Industries introduced the game&#x27;s first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.
From now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn&#x27;t here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.
Most unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.
On top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.
Other items in the shop include the Sentinel&#x27;s Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:</span>

If they have their iPads, they&#x27;ll likely retreat into YouTube watching mode, but you can use that screen to bring the family together for some fun game time as well. 
I rounded up a handful of games that should deliver entertainment for groups of kids and adults alike. The difficult task is finding games that are available on a wide variety of devices and offer crossplay support – meaning you can play together, even if you are on PlayStation 4 and the kids are on their iPads.
If you are just entertaining one or two kids, I also included a few games that they should get a kick out of, yet are only available on…</span>

                    <span>Both of this year’s blockbuster FPSes, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, launched with something up their sleeves: bugs. Even after some patches, these darn creepy crawlies aren’t shaken off so easily. These games are plagued by crashes, glitches, and general instability, to the point where playing them can be as fun as wading through a swarm of locusts.
Halo Infinite, though? The multiplayer component that had a bunch of flight tests? Pretty solid. Sure, a few bugs and matchmaking issues, but for the most part, it’s the most stable multiplayer FPS I’ve played this year. What was 343’s magic pesticide? Time. Simple as. Something Vanguard and Battlefield 2042 are only just catching up on.

Oculus have just announced their official Black Friday deals for their standalone VR headset, and all you&#x27;re going to get is a £50 / $50 voucher to spend on today&#x27;s best VR games rather than a discount on the headset itself. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a decent amount to kickstart your VR library, but the credit voucher also has some niggly conditions attached to it that make it a lot less satisfying than a simple £50 / $50 discount off the regular headset price.

Right now in The Sims 4, players are limited to making life choices for these Sims they&#x27;ve created, doomed to watch Neighbour Sims do their own thing. But on November 30th, the Neighborhood Stories update will let you influence what these NPCs do, from starting families to changing careers.

                    <span>Battlefield 2042 isn&#x27;t in the best place right now. It&#x27;s a game lacking many classic Battlefield features, and in amongst those empty spaces? Bugs. Lots of em. Dice know this and they&#x27;ve detailed three updates to address some of these issues, all of which are due out by the end of this year.

                    <span>The world of PC parts can be mighty confusing, especially with so many different options popping up almost daily. New technology here, there and everywhere. Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don&#x27;t worry - we&#x27;re here to help. 
WD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung&#x27;s computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman&#x27;s terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.

The Fortnite and Unreal Engine overlords say that Harmonix &quot;will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite&quot;. The battle royale has seen some fancy musical performances, with elaborate in-game events to promote pop stars including Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, but hopefully Harmonix aren&#x27;t consigned to advertising for eternity?

                    <span>Xbox has announced the Xbox Games With Gold line up for December and per usual, it includes two Xbox One games and two older-generation games. 
Four games are up for grabs this month. They are The Escapists 2 on Xbox One, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition on Xbox One, Orcs Must Die on Xbox 360, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360. Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. 
The Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…</span>

                    <span>According to announcements from both companies, music and rhythm game developer Harmonix is being acquired by Epic Games. 
Epic Games made a statement saying on its website about the company&#x27;s future, saying, &quot;The Harmonix team will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite while continuing to support existing titles including Rock Band 4.&quot;
Harmonix has a brief blog post on its site as well, followed by a short Q&amp;A covering the obvious questions regarding its active support for Rock Band and most recent release FUSER. Here&#x27;s the statement from Harmonix about joining the Epic family: 
For the time being, the company is sticking to keeping its upcoming seasons and events for its games in the pipeline, and won&#x27;t be discontinuing support in any way. Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.
Epic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer&#x27;s Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. 
Does this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?
In a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal.

“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”
TooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. 
However, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. 
“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” 
Meledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades.

                    <span>With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. 
Getting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. 
As you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. 
That’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. 
Head to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller.

                    <span>When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. 
According to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” 
Of course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. 
Do you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below!

Death is one of the few things we all have in common. We all experience death sooner or later, and that can be terrifying because we don’t truly know what awaits us on the other side. Salvation? Oblivion? Death’s Door offers an amusing interpretation of death by framing it as a boring, day-to-day business run by crows. While some of the crows may not find much enjoyment in their work, play…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game &quot;War&quot;, Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic&#x27;s Company Of Heroes does.
So it&#x27;s a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way&#x27;s demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series&#x27; core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.

                    <span>The studio behind Death Stranding have announced they&#x27;re opening a new division in Los Angeles to enter the worlds of television, film, and music. Kojima Productions have confirmed no specific projects or plans yet. Even as someone who has a lot of time and enthusiasm for Kojima&#x27;s self-serious wacky plots, I hope the plan isn&#x27;t for anything as banal as a Death Stranding movie. Their video games are delightful because they&#x27;re video games.

                    <span>Black Friday is weird. Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

                    <span>I was toiling away in the Black Friday deal mines when I uncovered one that our US friends might particularly appreciate: a titantic $1400 off the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced. This slimline gaming laptop, complete with a 300Hz IPS display, is now only $1600 – close to half price, which is an even bigger deal when the MSRP is the same as a serviceable used car.

                    <span>Alright, so I played Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, and just yesterday I finished Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases, and now I&#x27;m like, &quot;When is someone going to put these hot, young investigators into a dating sim?&quot; because that would be extremely funny. You know, Dream Daddy but Dream Detective or whatever.
Thing is, we&#x27;ve got Sexy Young Holmes and Sexy Young Poirot, sure, but two dudes don&#x27;t make a dating sim, right? Why, ITV needs somewhere in the region of 35 fragile young adults to head-wreck every summer in Love Island. So who else would I need hot young versions of for my imaginary dating sim game?

The Everyone Is Here update went live yesterday, bringing new challenges to Motion Twin&#x27;s soulslike that will let you unlock characters from Blasphemous, Hyper Light Drifter, Guacamelee, Skul: The Hero Slayer, Curse Of The Dead Gods, and, most importantly (for me), Hollow Knight. Hooray for Hollow Knight content!

                    <span>Cyber Monday has arrived, offering the last opportunity to grab some cheap Logitech kit this deals season. Most of the discounts from the past week remain in effect, but they&#x27;ll likely vanish come midnight so take a look now if you&#x27;re looking for a new mouse, keyboard, or anything else.

The company&#x27;s board of directors have formed this committee to oversee new policies and procedures &quot;to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination&quot;. And amidst calls for CEO Bobby Kotick to be removed, he&#x27;ll be one of the people in charge of bringing the committee progress reports.

The custom mode editor isn&#x27;t exactly swimming in creativity just yet, but interesting things are slowly beginning to emerge as time goes by. Like Andy&#x27;s Wingsuit Trainer, a course set among the clouds where you wing it through floating hoops as quickly as you can. Bravo Andy. Bravo.

                    <span>I doubt I’d be much cop at counting cards in Vegas, but I have just counted every single item on the patch notes for Precinct, the latest update for Romero Games’ prohibition-era kingpin sim Empire Of Sin. There are over 350 of them, from making gangsters less flirty to giving Al Capone his cigar back on the character select screen. It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. 


“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]&#x27;s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive. The team worked their asses off.”


Thankfully, the launch of the Make It Count DLC - and the accompanying free Precinct update - has been a lot smoother.

                    <span>This Friday is dubbed Black Friday in the USA because it&#x27;s a dark time, when people will literally be maimed or killed in the crush to buy cheap televisions. The lowest ebb of the year before Cyber Monday brings to the light of redemption to the world when kewl d00dz hackers hack the planet. But it does bring cheap video games. GOG have already started a small &quot;Pre-Black Friday sale&quot;, with good discounts including 50% off Disco Elysium and 50% off Cyberpunk 2077. Hmm. I might recommend it at that price?

Over the weekend, Riot Games posted a video giving a new look at the game and explaining how they plan to make it accessible to a wider audience by simplifying controls. They still haven&#x27;t announced a release date, but it looks promising.

                    <span>Hitman 3 is the conclusion to IO Interactive’s sandbox homicidin’ trilogy, but the game itself still has plenty of life in it yet. In a new “Year 2” trailer, IO producer Hakan Abrak has teased some fresh additions coming in 2022, from new modes to PC-specific upgrades like ray tracing and VR support.

                    <span>Following the conclusion of Arcane on Friday, Riot Games and Netflix have confirmed that the animated series based on League Of Legends will indeed get a second season. The only detail they are willing to confirm right now is that the voice actors behind Vi, Jinx, and Caitlyn will return, and I have no idea if that constitutes a spoiler or not because I&#x27;ve only seen the first three episodes. Check out the teasing teaser trailer below.

                    <span>It&#x27;s that time of year again, folks. It&#x27;s the week in November when the sky grows dark, the ground trembles underfoot, and wallets are busted open in the never-ending search for the biggest and best Black Friday deals. You will likely be seeing a lot of these deals posts appearing on RPS over the coming week, but I promise you this one&#x27;s properly good - because it&#x27;s us that&#x27;s on sale rather than a fancy mouse, keyboard or headset.  
From now until November 30th, yearly subscriptions to RPS are 35% off for new subscribers - and all you need to do is head over to our sign up page to get started. No codes or secret password at the Treehouse door required.

Probably shouldn&#x27;t have released them in that state, then. They say they plan to improve them, and did release a bug-fixing patch over the weekend. They will also put the original versions back on sale, and will give them to people who buy the remastered trilogy.

                    <span>Radiohead&#x27;s surprising collaboration with Epic Games is out now. The Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is a virtual environment designed to accompany and celebrate Radiohead&#x27;s classic Kid A and Amnesiac albums. It&#x27;s an odd project, but it&#x27;s one that makes sense for a band that are often experimental and technologically progressive.

Then they&#x27;ve also made items and costumes available for Rocket League, Fall Guys and Fortnite, turning Radiohead into just another brand to be engaged with in Epic&#x27;s dull metaversal future.

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

                    <span>Chums, I have a confession to make. For someone writing about Black Friday PC hardware deals, I don’t know all that much about PC hardware. Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.
