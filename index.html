There are different gears you can equip, and some of them are pretty ordinary. Rotten Chains, on the other hand, is a Special Grade gear, and it is immensely powerful. Unlike most resources, you can&#x27;t trade for it or open chests to find it. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to put in the hard yards in order to secure the gear inside Jujutsu Infinite.


How to obtain Rotten Chains in Jujutsu Infinite


There are two ways to obtain Rotten Chains inside the game. You can obtain it by defeating the Finger Bearer Boss in a raid or craft it directly with the correct resources. After completing the Finger Bearer Boss raid, there&#x27;s a chance for Rotten Chains to drop as the mai…</span>

Completing quests in Jujutsu Infinite is pretty important if you want to improve your in-game progression consistently. Some of them often reward you with valuable resources that can be extremely useful on your journey. Unlike typical resources, the Gilded Apple can&#x27;t be found in chests or traded in the Curse Market.


Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can obtain this item.


How to find the Gilded Apple in Jujutsu Infinite


To begin the process, you&#x27;ll need to activate the Gilded Apple quest from the NPC in the Numa Temple area. This location can be found to the southeast of Shijo Town, where everyone begins their journey. The NPC can be found near the mission…</span>

However, it is expensive, so if you’re not willing to pay for such an enthusiast device, then a cheaper version is on its way.


Before you get too excited, it’s still an expensive proposition. The RetroTink-4K CE (cheaper edition?) will still run you $475 USD. That’s quite a bit cheaper than the $750 for the RetroTink-4K Pro, but it’s still quite expensive. Considering you can get a Nintendo Switch for cheaper, you can see how this is an enthusiast-only device.


To back up for a sec, the RetroTink-4K is a type of hardware that upscales the video output of older devices. Your TV technically already does that, but for an…</span>

The events during Heavensturn events are never particularly challenging, but those during the 2025 event are easier than they’ve been in recent years. Getting your hands on the Great White Tsuchinoko minion is remarkably easy, as long as you have some knowledge of eastern culture and customs, as well as some understanding of in-game lore.

                              <span>It’s always the same at this time of year, the ball is prepped and ready to drop in Times Square, families are getting ready to gather together, and a whole new year full of fresh possibilities is almost upon us. New Year’s resolutions are being made around the world, and one is more common than any other. 


After the holiday season, filled with excuses to gorge and reasons to skip exercising, it’s fair to say that everyone feels a little down about their eating and fitness routines to an extent. The new year offers a chance to set an achievable goal, and if you’re anything like it, it usually has something to do with becoming more physically active. 


It’s an achievable goal, but there are issues when it comes to implementing new fitness regimes into day-to-day life. Many of us work at …</span>

                              <span>Dragon Tokens have confused many Blox Fruits players since they randomly got added to the account of certain players, but it has their use inside the game.


Incidentally, the mysterious item wasn&#x27;t available in the account of every player. Instead, it got added to the accounts of those who have been Blox Fruits for some time now and had downloaded Update 24 before the developers pulled back. As I said, this item has certain uses inside the game, so let&#x27;s understand how it works.


How to get Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits


Update 24 introduced several new things to Blox Fruits, which included an updated version of the Dragon Fruit. Unfortunately, the update was pulled back by the developers, and players who had the Dragon Fruit lost access to it. To compensate the players, they were handed something called a Dragon Token.


Again, this token is of two types. Players having a non-permanent or physical version of the Dragon Fruit were provided with a regular Dragon Token. Those who had a permanent Dragon Fruit were provided with a Permanent Dragon Token.


Incidentally, the price of Dragon Fruit has been raised from 4,000 Robux to 5,000 following the implementation of Update 24.




How to use Dragon Tokens in Blox Fruits


The use of a Dragon Token mostly depends on the type you have. If you have a permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to obtain a permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. The version will be completely randomized, but it&#x27;s a great return since you&#x27;re getting an upgraded version of the Dragon Fruit.


If you received a non-permanent Dragon Token, you can use it to get a non-permanent East or West Dragon Fruit. Again, the final item you get will be completely randomized. If you end up getting a duplicate Dragon Fruit in your inventory, it will be automatically changed to a Mythical Fruit.

But given the large history behind each member of the game&#x27;s cast, there are many more we would love to see. Here are 10 alternative skins we would love to see arrive in Marvel Rivals.


Black Suit (Spider-Man)

Although the character might be a hit gameplay-wise, Spidey&#x27;s Marvel Rivals default and alternative in-game suits are seen by many as a miss, with his PlayStation-exclusive Scarlet Spider being a saving grace. Well, that&#x27;s where the classic Black Suit comes in, as the simplistic look is both a fan favorite and one hell of a fit, so much so that Peter continued to wear…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s time to celebrate the end of 2024 and the start of a new year with a beautiful outfit in Dress to Impress. The Sparkling Resolution outfit features a dress, necklace, and sleeves but is only available until January 2, 2025.


How to get the Sparkling Resolution outfit in Dress to Impress


The Sparkling Resolution outfit is a limited-time set available in the Dress to Impress clothing shop for $6,000 in-game cash or the equivalent of 1,500 Robux. You can buy the set&#x27;s individual pieces or all three items at once starting from December 30 until the event&#x27;s end date, January 2, 2025.

You can view the Sparkling Resolution outfit by selecting the shoe and lipstick button on the left side of your screen and navigating to the dress button.


You have the option to buy each of the three items separately or all at once if you have enough cash. Below is the cost of every Sparkling Resolution piece:



Sparkling Dress: $4,500


Sparkling Sleeve: $1,000


Sparkling Necklace: $500



Purchasing all three pieces costs $6,000 in-game money, making it not only possible to acquire without spending real money but making it cheaper than sets like Myra the Magical Girl. However, it&#x27;s only available until January 2, giving you just a few days to get your hands on this exclusive outfit. 


It doesn&#x27;t come with a hairstyle or makeup, though, so you may have to use a few Dress to Impress codes to complete the set.


Like other outfits in Dress to Impress, you can customize the Sparkling Resolution set to match your current theme. Depending on the theme, you may have to change it to other common colors like white, black, red, or a mix of several hues. Similarly, if you&#x27;re not a fan of purple and want to try something new, you can experiment with various patterns and see what sticks.

In Jujutsu Infinite, chests help you get plenty of resources that are required to unlock power-ups like Domain Expansion and Innate Techniques. Some of these resources, like Maximum Scrolls, are rare items, and their spawn rates are extremely low. Naturally, you would want to use consumables to improve your luck, and a Jade Lotus is perhaps your best friend in this matter.

                              <span>When Grinding Gear Games dropped the announcement for Path of Exile 2 (PoE2), it wasn’t just about continuing the series. It was about shaking things up in a big way, making changes that fundamentally alter the way players would engage with the sequel to one of gaming&#x27;s most impactful ARPGs.


One of the biggest, most defining changes? The approach toward difficulty. From the slower, Souls-like campaign to the highly punishing Endgame, this topic is a firey one for the community. So, let’s talk about it: is the difficulty a bit too much, or is it exactly what the franchise needed to evolve?

Yes, games like Dance Dance Revolution, Rock Band, and Guitar Hero are undoubtedly reserved for those old-school gamers who still have their old consoles, or visit Dave &amp; Busters on a regular basis. However, that doesn’t mean that newer rhythm games don’t exist for current-generation Console or PC players, you just have to look a little harder to find them. 


And they’re worth playing for more reasons than simply passing the time, as well. Did you know that playing rhy…</span>

                              <span>Tilt your head to the sky, all you true believers out there: Marvel Studios rang in the new year with the first trailer for Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, a new animated series set to put a new spin on Peter Parker&#x27;s rise to heroism. 


Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has already crossed many boxes off the standard &quot;Spider-Man origin story&quot; checklist: a do-it-yourself superhero suit, high school drama, and a variation of Spidey&#x27;s age-old mantra about power and responsibility. However, the series&#x27; teaser made it clear as day that this retelling of the Wall Crawler&#x27;s early days is taking big swings and changing some things around.

                              <span>Some of the best swords in gaming are particularly iconic, such as the Keyblade and the Master Sword from The Legend of Zelda. They help give us a power fantasy in video games as they strengthen our heroes and strike fear into our foes. 


So here are the ten most iconic swords in gaming—and naturally—this is my humble opinion. Let&#x27;s go.


10. The Crucible (Doom Eternal)

The Crucible from Doom Eternal is the epitome of badass. This huge red sword with the flared blade tip is one of the main marketing images shown within the trailer of the game, as seen above, ramping up excitement for the 2020 sequel. It lets you slice and dice demons with its sheer power. It&#x27;s filled with demon energy and has some epic text on the blade that makes the…</span>

A full year on from its initial beta launch, now feels like as good a time as any to revisit Palia to see what’s changed. The good and bad news is… well, not that much.

Japanese publication Famitsu has held its traditional end-of-year interview round-up with game creators, speaking to 158 different people about their hopes and aspirations for 2025.
The replies weren&#x27;t totally focused on games – some of the interviewees spoke about what they were looking forward to seeing in the worlds of movies, music and tech in 2025 – but it was interesting to note that two of the Square Enix staffers included in the round-up mentioned Switch 2.

Nightdive Studio&#x27;s The Thing: Remastered launched in North America back on 5th December, giving Switch gamers in that territory the chance to (re)acquaint themselves with Computer Artwork&#x27;s cult squad-based shooter from 2002. However, the European release has been tied up for weeks and it&#x27;s yet to appear on eShops east of the Atlantic.
The developer and publisher of the remaster took to social media with an update, indicating that the game — based on John Carpenter&#x27;s 1982 film, of course — has been submitted to Nintendo of Europe and the team is just waiting for it to appear.

In the same Famitsu interview with Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, Sakaguchi revealed how he won’t be calling time on his career any time soon. Instead, he provided an update about his “new project”, which is believed to be a new “dark fantasy” title from Mistwalker.

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn&#x27;t. One I hadn&#x27;t even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about.
Anyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>Trading is one of the best ways to enhance your in-game development in Jujutsu Infinite, and it&#x27;s immensely beneficial as you approach the endgame content.


There are plenty of resources you will find in your inventory from the daily grind, and they are incredibly helpful. Whether you&#x27;re trying to get the best Innate Techniques or unlock Domain Expansion to improve your build, you&#x27;ll need specific resources. Trading will allow you to give away the resources that you don&#x27;t need and get back items that you&#x27;re short of.


Jujutsu Infinite trading guide


To unlock the trading system, you&#x27;ll need to reach level 300. This task isn&#x27;t as hard as you might think, and make sure to check out our leveling guide to ease the process. Once you reach level 300, you&#x27;ll be able to trade with other players…</span>

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s Wintervestigation quest series is finally wrapping up, with Noir telling you about one last case leading you to confront Sgt. Winter himself. Before meeting Sgt. Winter, you&#x27;ll need to search for some secret files that are part of his Naughty or Nice list.


Sgt. Winter Naughty or Nice list secret file location in Fortnite


You can find the secret files for Sgt. Winter&#x27;s Naughty or Nice list in a tunnel along Foxy Floodgate&#x27;s massive dam. As you reach this landmark, head up the zipline that connects the bottom of the dam to the road and stop around halfway. You&#x27;ll spot several openings to the tunnel, with one entrance having a gingerbread cookie in front of it.

Once you arrive at this spot, use your pickaxe to break open the tunnel before entering. You&#x27;ll spot three exclamation mark icons on top of various filing cabinets, one of which has Sgt. Winter&#x27;s Naughty or Nice list.


There&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll run into the same bug I did where the filing cabinets appear invisible. Don&#x27;t worry if this happens, as you can still interact with them as long as you hover over their general location.

You&#x27;ll also need to watch out for other players as you visit Foxy Floodgate, climb the dam, and examine the secret files. Make sure to have a weapon on hand in case someone arrives before or after you so you can swiftly eliminate them and move on with your quest.


Once you interact with the filing cabinets and the Naughty or Nice list, you&#x27;ll be ready to confront Sgt. Winter once and for all. You&#x27;ll spot him just south of Foxy Floodgate at an unnamed location, giving you a bit of a trek before completing this final Wintervestigation quest. Like before, other players can attack you anytime, so watch your surroundings as you travel to these spots.

                              <span>After much confusion over the last few days, there&#x27;s finally some clarity over Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite. This peculiar resource has been present inside the game since its launch, but there was no way to obtain it, getting players stuck in a particular quest, but that is no longer the case.


Here is how you can get Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite, and what&#x27;s the best way to use it.


Best Frost Petals location in Jujutsu Infinite


For most resources in Jujutsu Infinite, opening chests is the best way forward. That&#x27;s not the case for Frost Petals, which spawns all over Yuki Fortress. While the spawn spots aren&#x27;t restricted to one single location, they can be generally found behind the fort.


Move towards the edge of the map in this region, and you&#x27;ll find plenty of Frost Petals. The middle of the map also has these flowers spawning on the ground. Once picked, the flower will take 10 minutes to respawn on your server. If you&#x27;re willing to be patient and dedicate an hour or so, you can pick plenty of Frost Petals.


Incidentally, this is the only plant that spawns in the Yuki Fortress area. Other plants like Cursebloom and Spring Puffs can&#x27;t be found here. Frost Petals also seem exclusive to the Yuki Fortress area, and you&#x27;ll have to level up decently to access this location.




How to use Frost Petals in Jujutsu Infinite


Frost Petals work differently from other resources like Maximum Scrolls or Purified Curse Hands. You can use five of them to complete daily quests in the Yuki Fortress Area.  If you&#x27;re a beginner, your first priority is leveling up to Level 300 or higher. Doing so will allow you access to this area and help you to enhance your character further. Check out our farming guide to get all the resources efficiently.

                              <span>The Mines in Stardew Valley are filled with weird and wonderful monsters to defeat, each with its own resource drops and method of killing. While most are easy, some may prove problematic, including the Lava Crab. 


The Lava Crab is an enemy deep inside the Mines in Stardew Valley. At first glance, you might not even realize that it is hostile, as it looks suspiciously like a rock. These are very small differences between the appearance of a rock and that of a Lava Crab, such as a smoother highlight, but those differences are hard to spot if you’re speedrunning through the floors. 


Whether you’re hunting for Lava Crabs to get their worthwhile drops or trying to complete the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer’s Guild (which requires you to kill 60 Rock Crabs of any type), here’s …</span>

                              <span>Square Enix announced its new strategy to release more multiplatform games a few months after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth came out exclusively on PlayStation 5. Because of this dichotomy, many wondered if the company suddenly changed opinions because that game sold poorly.


Yoshinori Kitase is an important figure at Square Enix and the producer of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. He recently talked with IGN Brazil and addressed this exact issue, explaining that Rebirth was among the three titles that received the award for Best-Selling Game during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Partners Awards in Japan back in October. &quot;I think being recognized in this aspect gives me the certainty that we have reached a certain level,&quot; said Kitase.

                              <span>Limit Break is a powerful form of enhancement that will be extremely useful in Anime Adventures if you want to boost your characters.


There are several ways to power up your characters in the game. Doing so is extremely fruitful, as the first part of the relaunch might feel boring for many. Thanks to the enhancements, you can power up your characters faster. Here&#x27;s how limit breaking works in the relaunched version of Anime Adventures.


Limit breaking in Anime Adventures, explained


To Limit Break, you&#x27;ll need to have 12 Mythic or higher units and also get a Divine Wish. Getting characters isn&#x27;t a big challenge, and you can do it using different methods. The trickier task is to get the Divine Wish, which is mandatory to enhance your characters.


Complete the following steps once you have a Divine Wish:



Go to the Evolve area.


Talk with the Limit Break NPC.


Select the unit you want to Limit Break using the Pick Unit option.


Click on the icon on the right and decide which units you&#x27;ll sacrifice.


Complete the process by selecting 12 Mythic units and one Divine Wish.


Click Limit Break to upgrade the character of your choice. The characters you sacrificed won&#x27;t return.

Best ways to farm Divine Wish in Anime Adventures


The best way to get Divine Wish in Anime Adventures is by paying attention to the daily challenge. You will be guaranteed one wish daily if you complete the daily challenge. Also, be on the lookout for limited-time events. Some of these events will drop Divine Wish among the rewards.


Once you Limit Break a unit, all characters on your board will get a 5% permanent damage boost. Once you&#x27;ve collected enough characters, make sure to Limit Break your best units to increase your team&#x27;s potential.

It reached a rather surprising level of popularity. It’s an extremely unconventional and unfriendly game.

                              <span>As soon as crossover content was brought up in the context of Helldivers 2, players started getting concerned over what it might entail. Judging by what Arrowhead Games&#x27; CCO Johan Pilestedt has just shared, however, Helldivers 2 crossovers should be fairly innocuous in the grand scheme of things.


More specifically, even though Power Rangers were mentioned as one of the potential Helldivers 2 crossover opportunities, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be on the docket. Not yet, at least. This has unsurprisingly been one of the hot topics on the Helldivers 2 subreddit, with one of the more popular recent threads asking where the &quot;crossover line in the sand&quot; ought to be drawn. The surprising bit came about when Pilestedt himself chimed in on the matter. According to him, the line is drawn right here:

                              <span>Events in Infinity Nikki are ever-changing, so there’s always something new to do. The newest event is called “Into a Starry Night”, and you’ll need to complete some specific objectives to reap the event rewards.


To see everything that you need to do for this event, open up the event menu and navigate to the “Into a Starry Night” screen. Most of the event quests are pretty self-explanatory, and you’ll immediately be given the quests to complete in your quest log. However, one of the quests for the first day of the event can be quite tricky to complete due to the rarity of the necessary item.

                              <span>EasyGameStation has announced via a Twitter post that an updated version of 2007’s roguelite item shop dungeon crawler game, Recettear is on its way. Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale HD Edition will release sometime in 2025 on PC.


Don’t get your hopes up too far, however. This looks less like a remaster and more like a re-release. At least, if the screenshots attached to the tweet are any indication. I mean, truly, Recettear wasn’t technically HD when it was released. It ran at 1280x960 at most, so it wasn’t widescreen, and you’d typically keep it in a window. The screenshots are, at the very least, widescreen resolution. It’s hard to tell if they reach 1920x1080 resolution because the attached shots are formatted in the web-friendly 1200x675.

Things really weren&#x27;t looking good for Atari for a while. Before current CEO Wade Rosen shifted the company&#x27;s focus back to retro gaming, Atari had its eyes firmly on cryptocurreny and... hotels? Yeesh. It wasn&#x27;t great. Now, however, the future looks bright for the once-mighty Atari, with the firm&#x27;s acquisitions of Digital Eclipse and Nightdive Studios seemingly paying off.
To demonstrate this, Atari has released a 2024 recap video in which it showcases every major release from the previous 12 months.

We all know Stardew Valley has been a runaway success ever since it released on PC in 2016. But it continues to sell gangbusters across multiple platforms, and as of December 2024, has reached an absolutely huge milestone.
The farming sim has now sold 41 million copies, ConcernedApe announced on the official Stardew Valley press site. While most of those copies are on PC — 26 million, even — the Switch got a special shoutout, where a further 7.9 million copies have been purchased.

If you’re reading this on October 11th 2024, then 30 years ago today Final Fantasy 3 (aka VI) was released in North America. A lot of memorable games (Super Metroid, DKC, Earthworm Jim, Ridge Racer, and Doom II, to name a few) turn 30 this year, but Final Fantasy VI stands out to me because I was privileged to play and beat it a couple of months before its official release.

Just recently, it was revealed that developer Acquire worked with Nintendo to brainstorm &quot;over 100 options&quot; for the title of its new RPG that would go on to be called Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.
Now, in a fresh interview with Nintendo Dream (thanks, Nintendo Everything), producer Akira Otani states that one of the potential titles in consideration was actually &#x27;Mario &amp; Luigi Wonder&#x27;, but the team was forced to abandon this idea when Super Mario Bros. Wonder released on 20th October 2023.

Nintendo has shared an adorable piece of artwork for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom as it looks ahead to 2025 and &quot;all the wisdom it brings&quot;.
The artwork itself is a pastel-based image of our heroine chilling out atop a small hill with her companion Tri in tow along with a couple of Zols (which, presumably, are friendly echoes of the gelatinous green blobs).

All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven&#x27;t played but I&#x27;d watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don&#x27;t quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year&#x27;s end. So here&#x27;s my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It&#x27;s an unusually diverse triad this time.

Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

Missed the streak? You are simply wrong. Time has no bearing here. Here is the column.

                              <span>Last weekend a Meta engineer posted Linux kernel patches to make use of the AMD INVLPGB instruction for broadcast TLB invalidation. The Linux kernel can in turn invalidate TLB entries on remote CPUs without needing to send IPIs and without having to wait for remote CPUs to handle those interrupts. Synthetic benchmarks shown in that patch series were very promising and thus I carried out some benchmarking over the holidays of this AMD INVLPGB support for the Linux kernel.</span>

Even in the year of the PS5 Pro, we&#x27;ve seen some of the best art styles on show on the Switch.

As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that&#x27;s the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it&#x27;s like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore.

                              <span>The fell moons rise, and in their cold glare emerges a parcel from the dirt. Bloat and gangrene, crimped as if by tourniquet. A dark promise wriggles within. Grip the fibrous handles, feel its jagged soul imprint upon your palm. Now pull! Rend the sinew, tear muscle from bone, hatch their fetid gift! The yoke draws near! Take up the slip and read the words upon its face.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>According to a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims should be supported by extraordinary evidence. A new piracy scare story published on Sunday takes a different approach. The extraordinary claim is that fake IPTV portals run by law enforcement are entrapping &quot;ordinary users&quot; to obtain evidence of their crimes. Supported by exactly zero evidence, the report claims that hundreds of internet users have already been identified.

                              <span>My selection box isn&#x27;t really a selection box. It&#x27;s a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I&#x27;m dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. 


So! Rather than digging out three of the games I&#x27;ve actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I&#x27;m going to gamble on recommending a few I&#x27;ve barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let&#x27;s begin.

The court found that Cloudflare&#x27;s services are instrumental in facilitating access to live pirate streams, undermining Italy&#x27;s &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; legislation. The order, which applies in Italy, affects Cloudflare&#x27;s CDN, DNS resolver, WARP and proxy services. It also includes a broad data disclosure section.

                              <span>Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

                              <span>Around 2016, sports streaming site Rojadirecta closed its doors to visitors from Spain after losing its legal battle with Mediapro. Despite the win, the broadcaster was disappointed that the court had found the company behind Rojadirecta liable, but not company owner Igor Seoane. After the Supreme Court held that Seoane could be held liable, last Friday a court confirmed total damages of $33 million, with Seoane and the company jointly liable for half of that amount.

                              <span>Once-thriving Usenet provider NSE was targeted by Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN many years ago. Under legal pressure, the provider felt forced to shut down its successful business. Though NSE ultimately triumphed in court, that victory came years later. NSE is now demanding millions of euros to compensate for the alleged damage to its business. BREIN, however, sees things differently.

Due to the intervention of Dark Powers and also, half the Treehouse already being on holiday, we neglected to do a round-up of staff Xmas plays before signing off for the year.

If I publish this and it turns out we have two, please divide into rival factions and have a comments war over which is the real one. Apologies! Normal service will resume next year.

                              <span>Sixteen well-known suppliers active in the UK pirate IPTV market have been selected by broadcaster Sky to star in a new phase of the company&#x27;s ISP blocking program. A new order obtained at the High Court is technically an extension of an existing order won last year. However, with significant tweaks, upgrades and an extremely determined opponent, pirates may be about to face their toughest challenge yet.

                              <span>The easiest way to hurt a pirate site, at least temporarily, is by taking away its domain name. Historically, domain name registries have been hesitant to take action but with the right approach, progress can be made. This week, anti-piracy group BREIN reported that following their complaints, the .nl and .eu registries took action against several &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains. On closer inspection, it appears that copyright has little to do with it.

                              <span>Coordinated by Italy last month, a huge law enforcement operation reportedly &#x27;dismantled&#x27; a pirate IPTV service with 22 million users. That&#x27;s an extraordinary number and shows why countries like Italy have adopted mass site blocking measures. Logic suggests that the removal of such a huge player from the market might reduce the need for blocking measures, if only temporarily. The data shows that in the wake of the action, blocking demands significantly increased.

                              <span>&quot;A tactically rich turn-based game with some meaty role-playing elements&quot;, was how Staff Sergeant James Archer characterised his Menace hands-on, back in September. The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.
And by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.

                              <span>I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.
Recently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?

                              <span>Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.
Taxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It&#x27;s not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.

It begins as a &quot;fireball of occult potentiality,&quot; dangling in the Great Hall of the Unseen University, which evolves into a ghostly &quot;embryo universe.&quot; The embryo expands &quot;lightly as a thought,&quot; with spectral continents &quot;sleeting&quot; through walls and people. It surges across the landscape until the entire population and geography of the Disc is exactly duplicated and enclosed by a shimmering shadow-self of &quot;shining threads that followed every movement.&quot;

                              <span>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic&#x27;s board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you&#x27;re not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they&#x27;re already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!

The Winter sale that began yesterday is almost identical to the Autumn sale that ended just two weeks ago, for example. But you can still find one or two gifts if you bore deep enough into the ice. Me? I&#x27;m only interested in one thing. How many of these games are snowy and chilly enough to induce wonderful hypothermia? I&#x27;m on a frostbitten quest to find out.

At least that&#x27;s what the interstellar pilots of Elite Dangerous are celebrating in the galaxy-sized multiplayer space sim. Earlier this month, the Thargoid menace finally landed in the Sol system, putting earth itself under threat for the first time, not to mention other human homeworlds and colonies. This meant players were invited to drop everything and head for home - to embark on one last great stand against the final, desperate, and dangerous alien attacker: a Thargoid Titan called &quot;Cocijo&quot;. Don&#x27;t worry, they got him.

                              <span>Frostpunk developers 11 bit studios have cancelled a new, console-oriented game in response to both &quot;shifting market trends&quot; - in particular, declining player enthusiasm for &quot;narrative-driven, story-rich games&quot; - and specific problems during development. As a consequence, a number of 11 bit staff are going to lose their jobs, though at least half of the affected development team are being offered the chance to move to other projects, including a few unannounced ones.

                              <span>At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.
This is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.

                              <span>The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn&#x27;t the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt&#x27;s sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. 


Speaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri&#x27;s situation at the start of the game.

                              <span>&quot;We are a people who honour democracy,&quot; said the dog, scratching himself. &quot;Per our custom, you may drink of our fresh water.&quot; The dog was called Senator Umeshefaat, and he was very civil, even if he was shedding his black and white fur everywhere. We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator&#x27;s personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was &quot;hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.&quot; I suppose every politician has their enemies. 
That Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there&#x27;s a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn&#x27;t half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud&#x27;s low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.

                              <span>Insults are so serious, these days. They&#x27;re all so insulting, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the roaster and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I&#x27;ve found or made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.

Anyway, I have a job I need to get to and there&#x27;s this guy who&#x27;s going to mentor me on my first day. A guy called Mo, who seems nice but isn&#x27;t particularly talkative. Prefers paper and pencil.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been rumoured for a while that Sony are about to buy Kadokawa Corporation, a monolithic Japanese media conglomerate that means nothing to the bulk of you unless I append the magic words &quot;parent company of Dark Souls developers FromSoftware&quot; and possibly also, &quot;parent company of Spike Chunsoft&quot;. Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... &quot;a strategic capital and business alliance agreement&quot;. What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?

This pioneering file-sharing site, once a hub for millions of users, was abruptly shut down on December 19th, 2004. Today, we revisit the Suprnova story and speak with the site&#x27;s founder about its lasting impact and the YouTube empire he built in recent years.

                              <span>They say hope is the first step on the road to disappointment, and reader, I’ve made a pretty damn big step. Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.
A cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.

                              <span>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod&#x27;s features has ballooned. It&#x27;s now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff &#x27;em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday.

                              <span>First revealed all the way back in December 2023, Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio&#x27;s sci-fi action adventure Exodus hit us with a few things: Matthew McConaughey is involved, it looks a bit like Mass Effect, it&#x27;s being developed by BioWare veterans, and it loves a bit of time dilation. In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things. Like sucker-punching armoured space bears in the face with electro-pistols.

                              <span>After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the &quot;democratic government&quot; of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and &quot;Liber-tea&quot;, they&#x27;ve teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.
From today, you&#x27;ll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone&#x27;s despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there&#x27;s the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing &quot;freedom&quot; to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.
We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead&#x27;s wanton aggression, which absolutely isn&#x27;t a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

                              <span>Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it&#x27;s the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin&#x27;s suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.
The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

                              <span>Italians who simply view pirate IPTV via illicit subscriptions have been warned for months that their activities could be reported to the judicial authorities for potential prosecution. As part of an investigation into a pirate IPTV subscription seller, a total of 23 people have appeared in court in recent months for simply buying a pirate package. Judges in two separate proceedings have now acquitted all 23 after concluding that this type of piracy isn&#x27;t actually a crime.

                              <span>Suing people for consuming content illegally can be a risky endeavor for companies with brands to protect. Nevertheless, sports rightsholders now seem prepared to put brand integrity on the line in their fight against IPTV pirates. Spain&#x27;s LaLiga is already mailing out &#x27;fines&#x27;, ostensibly to people who simply watched pirate streams. Predictably, there&#x27;s more to it than that.

                              <span>Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It&#x27;s a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you&#x27;re a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either &quot;salvage&quot; them or &quot;sentence&quot; them to the incinerator.

                              <span>Great was the adulation last week when FromSoftware announced a new Elden Ring game, Elden Ring: Nightreign - and great the lamentation from certain quarters when it was revealed to be a co-op-focussed experience. If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring&#x27;s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you&#x27;re just sitting there. Playing another &quot;cow&quot; card. Okay.
Guess you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

                              <span>For over a decade, The Pirate Bay has been accepting Bitcoin donations. In dollar terms, this provided a relatively modest but consistent revenue stream. However, if the torrent site had held onto its early Bitcoin, it could have amassed a small fortune, worth $14 million today. The same applies to BitcoinTorrentz, which once charged today&#x27;s equivalent of $8,000 per gigabyte transferred.

                              <span>Sometimes dogs are hard to shut up. Over a year and half after releasing Hrot from early access, the developer of the Quake-inspired shooter has fixed the dogs after discovering that a few of the canines have been, for some players, barking in a hideous and endless loop.

                              <span>At 9 years old, in the plastic seats of a Sega Rally arcade machine, I quickly learned that &quot;automatic&quot; is better than &quot;manual&quot; without understanding why. And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along. Thank you Wreckfest, for all the bottled road rage you allowed me to unleash.

If you don&#x27;t have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I&#x27;ve had a word with Santa&#x27;s elves, and they say it&#x27;s permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll feed him to the Maw.

It returns us to the days of LAN parties and dial-up, of demo discs and Fileplanet – a more innocent era, before multiplayer shooters fell under the spell of progression. Not that innocent, maybe. There were plenty of arseholes back then. Some of them now run very large software companies. But at least there was no grinding to ruin your bunnyhopping.

                              <span>Will the bulletting of my beloved dinosaurs never cease? Turok: Origins will revisit the dino-hunting archery of ye olde Nintendo 64, reimagining it as a story of three native huntsfolk out to lambast large lizards. The big new angle is that it&#x27;ll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

                              <span>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for Tekken 8, and at the same time a trailer dropped a big unmistakable hint for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night&#x27;s Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.

                              <span>Back in the mid &#x27;90s, I was hooked on an PC racing game called Screamer. It got a sequel a couple of years later, and then the series went dormant. Until now, when it&#x27;s seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You&#x27;ll find a trailer below.

                              <span>CD Projekt have screened the first trailer for The Witcher 4, the next instalment in their fantasy monster-slaying series. It’s another single player open world RPG, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Ciri is the protagonist. In fact, she&#x27;s the protagonist for a whole new Witcher saga, though there’s a tease at the end of the footage that crusty old Geralt may return as well.

Like its predecessor, this one’s a party-based CRPG with tactical combat, featuring single player and online co-op. Here’s a trailer. Warning: it has shiny rock people in it, the worst videogame enemy.

                              <span>Sifu and Absolver developers Sloclap have announced Rematch, a 5v5 multiplayer football game with a gentle dusting of science fiction, out in summer 2025. If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers&#x27; previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It&#x27;s like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it&#x27;s due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It&#x27;s also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it&#x27;s a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

                              <span>A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

The trailer also treats us to a few snippets of the game&#x27;s story scenes, shoot-outs and punch-ups. We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

                              <span>Tonight is The Game Awards 2024, the first since Geoff Keighley killed E3 and consumed its heart in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s &quot;embarrassing&quot; shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

                              <span>At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it&#x27;s a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it&#x27;s specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman&#x27;s back. I understand why it&#x27;s supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don&#x27;t.

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

                              <span>In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That&#x27;s a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (&quot;The goal is to do everything, right?&quot;). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it&#x27;s ever been.

                              <span>If Space Marine 2&#x27;s wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends &quot;inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore&quot;. Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

Even after you quit, it lingers on the edge of your awareness like a muffled bassline. It glitters in the air around you like a cloud of spores. It cannot be denied. It can only be…

                              <span>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve&#x27;s new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it&#x27;s only going to be an option - not the new default.

Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. &quot;Page 1 body content is quite short&quot; it says if I go under. How cute is that &quot;quite&quot;? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about Blippo+. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence.

                              <span>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don&#x27;t even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can&#x27;t be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it&#x27;s your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it&#x27;s time to play Skeal.

                              <span>Infamous evolutionary flop Spore, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It&#x27;s a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There&#x27;s an explanatory video below.

The differences are myriad, given that Breaker is also 3D, open world, co-op and a roguelite. It also now has a release date for its launch into Steam Early Access: January 14th, 2025.

It&#x27;s about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.

It&#x27;s been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream. It was also released during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from the Epic Games Store now.

                              <span>Back when I played Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest, I fought a cave-dwelling boss who summoned hordes of grotty subterranean wildlife to swamp me. Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it&#x27;s out on Steam. Not only that, it&#x27;s arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added &quot;scheduled mode&quot; that adds more charm to an already lovely game.
