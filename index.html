                              <span>Grab your pickaxe and secure your book of procedurally-generated poetry, because Dwarf Fortress is out on Steam right, flipping, now. Bay 12 Games&#x27;s hugely ambitious colony sim, which is notionally a game about building a fortress for small, bearded humanoids, but is really an engine for generating elaborate fantasy histories and player-driven stories within them, has been in active development since 2003, with an initial launch in 2006. Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades. It&#x27;s also famously as impenetrable as its title suggests, mainly due to its ASCII visuals and unwieldy, keyboard-exclusive control scheme.

                              <span>UK publisher Rebellion is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary. As part of that, the company is giving away one of its most notable games – Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This is the updated version of Rebellion&#x27;s best stab at AvP, which originally released in 1999, and was published by Fox Interactive.
You can grab the game by heading over to Rebellion&#x27;s storefront, where the offer is displayed proudly on the front page. There is a minor catch. You have to sign up to Rebellion&#x27;s newsletter, after which a Steam key for the game will be sent to you.

That&#x27;s probably why this ultra-premium option launched at an eye-watering $149.99 when it debuted three years ago. Now though, Amazon are offering the Viper Ultimate for its lowest ever price, just $59.99, fancy charging dock included. This is an awesome deal - and I&#x27;m not just saying that because I use this mouse every day (and have done for years).

There has been a lot of good Godzilla news as of late, no matter which version of the big green monster you prefer. Apple TV+ is developing a Godzilla and the Titans streaming series, the Godzilla vs. Kong sequel wrapped up production last month, and Toho confirmed it&#x27;s working on a new film set to release in 2023. Unfortunately, we&#x27;re going to have to wait months, even years, to see what comes of those projects. Arriving far sooner than any of those is the big collaboration between the monster brawler GigaBash and the Godzilla universe. After weeks of speculation, we finally know what&#x27;s coming as part of this DLC update, and it&#x27;s a good bunch of kaiju.
Starting tomorrow, GigaBash owners will be able to download the Godzilla 4 Kaiju DLC pack and get immediate access to Giga…</span>

A nice surprise this morning for Elden Ring fans, as developer FromSoftware has announced that the acclaimed fantasy RPG will be receiving a free update on all platforms tomorrow, December 7, bringing with it the long-rumored opening of The Lands Between&#x27;s many mysterious colosseums.
Having stood foreboding over the battlefields since the title&#x27;s launch back in February of this year, the colosseums of Limgrave, Leyndell, and Caelid will finally raise the portcullis and allow the mightiest of Elden Ring warriors the opportunity to test their mettle within the ancient, battle-worn walls of the granite ring.
According to the blurb accompanying the new trailer, (which you can check out below), the colosseums will see Elden Ring players waging war in &quot;duels, free-for-alls, and team fights&quot;, putting all of their sword &amp; sorcery abilities to the ultimate test. You might have proven your worth against Malenia,Blade of Miquella, but verily, how do you fare against xBarryBlazes420x?
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Further fixes in the works
Krafton and Striking Distance Studios have begun addressing the technical issues affecting sci-fi horror title The Callisto Protocol — The development team has already rolled out new patches on PC and console platforms, hoping to fix some of the bugs and glitches plaguing the occupants of Black Iron Prison.
The first update, which dropped this past week, was delivered to the PC edition of the game, and specifically focuses on the heavy stuttering that has been troubling many reviewers and players. According to Striking Distance Studios founder Glen Schofield, the frustrating stutter issue was an oversight, caused by the wrong coding to be patched at the final hour. It is hoped that this new update will improve general stability for all PC players moving forward.

Yesterday, console players received a patch of their own, which looks to combat frame rate drops and random crashing on the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the survival horror adventure. Additionally, Striking Distance developers noted that they were aware of some problems caused by the visual-heavy title&#x27;s ray-tracing effects. Further investigation is being made into the overall performance of The Callisto Protocol on all platforms, with further fixes and patches coming in the near future.
&quot;We hear you,&quot; said Schofield in a new message posted Sunday. &quot;As we say in the [patch update] tweet, we will communicate and keep you all updated. We want you to play the game as intended.&quot;
The Callisto Protocol is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>From Funkotron to Hollywood
In a pretty surprising announcement that I don&#x27;t think anybody saw coming, Amazon Studios has announced that it has begun pre-production on a new feature film adaptation of the classic Sega Mega Drive adventure ToeJam &amp; Earl — The new movie was announced yesterday in The Hollywood Reporter.
The new film is being produced by Unanimous Media — the studio founded by Stephen Curry — with a screenplay penned by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, who have worked on the Hotel Transylvania franchise, as well as the upcoming Disney+ series, Superfudge. The movie will be co-produced by Story Kitchen, headed up by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad and Sonic the Hedgehog producer Dmitri Johnson.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RQlK-jTIiwU
ToeJam &amp; Earl, created by Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson, hit the 16-bit market in 1991 and concerns the esoteric adventures of two hep-cat space aliens, who become marooned on Earth after their spaceship crashlands on our horrible little planet. From there, the two tripped-out protagonists must gather together the remnants of their ship, while avoiding delightfully satirical characters that symbolize the bizarre nature of human life.
Something of a cult classic, ToeJam &amp; Earl would be followed by two sequels: 1993&#x27;s Panic of Funkotron and 2002&#x27;s Mission to Earth. More recently, 2019 saw the release of crowdfunded title Back in the Groove, which returned the franchise to its split-screen, 3/4 perspective mechanics. While TJ &amp; E have been a part of gaming for many decades, the franchise is tightly held, with most of the games merely &quot;good&quot; at best. As such it seems an odd choice for a modern movie adaptation. However, the colorful universe and way-out characters and situations should make for some pretty twisted entertainment.
The untitled ToeJam &amp; Earl movie is currently in pre-production at Amazon Studios.

                              <span>And I say give it to him
David Harbour is one of my favorite actors right now. He was one of my favorite characters in Stranger Things, and after seeing him in his new Christmas-y comedy action flick Violent Night this past weekend, he cemented his place as one of my favorite actors working today, period. He can do it all -- drama, comedy, and most importantly, the surrogate father trope that been so hot in games the past console generation. Based on his serious nerd cred alone, I&#x27;m surprised Harbour&#x27;s only games credit will be an upcoming horror game along with Jodie Comer, star of the spy thriller series Killing Eve.
There&#x27;s a chance that all might change, however, because in an interview with Video Games FN, David Harbour shared another game series he dreams of working on: God of War. “I really like what those guys in the God of War universe are doing with my buddy Richard Schiff as Odin,&quot; he said. &quot;They sort of mess around with that genre too, and they&#x27;re always surprising in terms of these gods and they wind up becoming--Thor is a big old jerk and Odin being this kind of older intellectual. I&#x27;d be interested in possibly doing some of that.”

Well Mr. Harbour, we would also be interested in you doing some of that. After a series of action-packed roles, he&#x27;s proved he&#x27;d be a perfect fit in both stature and demeanor. Now I&#x27;m not advocating for any form on nepotism, but if Richard Schiff is already a friend on the inside, he might be able to get Harbour an audition, at the very least, for any new roles that might arise in the next God of War game.
Seeing as God of War Ragnarok just came out a few weeks ago, we don&#x27;t have so much as an announcement that another GoW game is in the works, but I&#x27;d bet my money plans have already been lined up for some time now. Now if they can only get David Harbour involved, I might finally be persuaded to give the series a second try...

                              <span>Nobody cares that much about the Game Awards
The Game Awards are nearly here again, and gamers everywhere have taken up the annual tradition of pretending the Game Awards are important. All across my Twitter timeline, I&#x27;ve come across the same old takes, from people lamenting the biggest snubs of the year to people furiously debating the Game of the Year while conveniently ignoring 2/3 of the nominees. At the heart of it all, though, I see the truth: nobody really cares about this stuff.
The Game Awards are not prestigious. Nobody actually cares about the winner of any category for more than an hour after the ceremony airs. Even Game of the Year, ostensibly the biggest award in all of video games, as far as I can tell, just doesn&#x27;t matter all that much. Last year&#x27;s GotY winner, It Takes Tw…</span>

Quality assurance, or QA, employees at ZeniMax Media are currently holding a vote on whether or not they should form a union. Over 300 workers are part of a group that&#x27;s now determining whether it will join growing unionization efforts in the industry.
As the New York Times reports, quality assurance employees at ZeniMax are conducting a vote. Workers will be allowed to sign a union authorization card, or weigh in anonymously over electronic means.
This process will conclude at the end of this month, and will affect QA workers at studios like Bethesda. The employees are organizing under the ZeniMax Workers United banner, working with the Communication Workers of America (CWA).

We&#x27;re fast approaching the launch of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on April 7th, 2023 (yes, it&#x27;ll be here before you know it!) and we&#x27;ve already seen a boatload of characters from the first two trailers, including the likes of Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Funky Kong, and more.
It seems Nintendo is still keeping a few things under wraps, however, as an unannounced character has been spotted via a recent McDonald&#x27;s promotion. The news comes via Twitter user @Kikaim, who recently posted an image showing eight toys that will reportedly come with Happy Meal toys in Japan starting this month. Seven of the eight are pretty self explanatory and include Luigi, Peach, Toad, Donkey Kong, Bowser, and two versions of Mario.

Astroneer, the charming little Minecraft-meets-No Man&#x27;s Sky sandbox, won us over when it was released back in January of this year and we have been enjoying regular updates ever since. Now the good folk over at System Era Softworks have introduced new festive content in an update titled &#x27;Project C.H.E.E.R&#x27;.
Aside from the usual bug fixes and improvements, this update also introduces toy production and delivery (&#x27;tis the season, after all), special event missions and more.

                              <span>Going Cuckoo for Kukoos.
Despite the Nintendo Switch’s reputation for being a family-friendly console, the number of truly kid-focused games on the platform are surprisingly few and far between. And if you take licensed games out of the discussion, the number falls even more. Currently, outside of some notable titles like New Super Lucky’s Tale and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury, there is a distinct lack of big-budget kid-friendly games. Kukoos: Lost Pets aims to fill that hole in the Switch’s library by creating not only a game designed primarily for a younger audience but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family together.
Upon booting up Kukoos: Lost Pets, the first thing that jumped out at us is just how strong the game’s presentation is. In many ways, Kukoos: Lost Pets feels like an episode of a long-lost cartoon show. The overall aesthetics looks like a mix between Fall Guys and Super Monkey Ball, evoking the simple, memorable, and instantly recognizable art style. Character designs are wacky and exaggerated, the environment is full of vivid and cartoony colors, and the writing feels as though it was ripped straight from a Saturday morning cartoon.

We&#x27;ve discussed the glitches seen in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet at length here at Nintendo Life, and while the novelty has largely worn off for many, we simply had to share this one.
As reported by the folks over at Automaton, it seems that some players are starting to see disembodied heads floating through the world when taking part in a specific battle at the entrance to the Naranja / Uva Academy. It apparently occurs when an NPC walks directly through the Pokémon during the middle of the battle (as you do), with the majority of the body disappearing to leave the head floating through space.

                              <span>First look at movie&#x27;s Piranha Plant.
It is difficult to miss promotional material for The Super Mario Bros. Movie at the moment. There have been two official trailers, a handful of posters, the release of the main theme, and that&#x27;s not to mention the F.L.U.D.D.-scale leaks that we seem to come across every week. Now the film&#x27;s marketing department is moving the promo campaign into a whole new dimension (see what we did there?) as Illumination&#x27;s Mario has taken to the 3D billboard.
This should come as no surprise to us by now. In 2022, can you really deem a product &#x27;officially released&#x27; if it hasn&#x27;t had a 3D billboard campaign? We don&#x27;t think so. So it is nice to see Mario jumping in on the hype.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

November was a pretty big month for Nintendo. Not only did the latest generation of Pokémon launch with Scarlet and Violet, but the Switch also benefited from the usual Black Friday offers that inevitably pop up each and every year.
Such a potent combination is bound to lead to some impressive sales and, according to GamesIndustry&#x27;s Christopher Dring, the Switch was comfortably the best-selling console during November in the UK with an increase of roughly 175% month-on-month (exact sale figures are unfortunately not available). The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet OLED Model only accounted for around 8% of total console sales, though it&#x27;s clear that the launch of the latest Pokémon generation gave the Switch family a significant boost with UK audiences overall.

                              <span>One of the big reasons Fortnite became one of the biggest games on the planet is because it could run on anything, from phones to tired laptops to hand-me-down desktops. That’s created an expectation that the game is graphically basic, but as we head into 2023, the shooter—first released in 2017—just got one hell of a…

                              <span>Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. 
IGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that &quot;This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.&quot; First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” 
Given the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. &quot;I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot; 
Sony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.
As a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation.

The game was originally announced in 2020 (before Pentiment) and we took a look at it earlier this year. Now, however, we had a chance to go hands-on. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard for a look at this unique game that is surprisingly reliant on the tactical power of farts.

                              <span>Vývojář Alan Coopersmith, který na X11, resp. X.Org pracuje řadu let už od svého působení ve starém dobrém Sun Microsystems, připravil aktualizaci řady komponent X.Org Serveru. Nejde o žádné revoluční věci, spíše běžnou údržbu posouvající funkčnost zase trochu do moderní doby. Některé balíčky dosaly CI (continuous integration), pro vydávání se přechází z Bzip2 na XZ tarbally, upraveny jsou varování kompilátoru, vylepšena kompatilibita s Clangem či novějšími verzemi Glibc. Aktualizován byl i DDX ovladač stařičkých karet ATI Rage 128.</span>

Criminal referrals, membership of a major anti-piracy group, and links to a company with IPTV-blocking skills, make United Media a special type of partner.

                              <span>For the past week or so, some folks playing Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the PC have been encountering a bug that, at the end of the game’s dialogue sequences, would just go ahead and play a honking loud air horn.

Details were kept close to the chest, and only brief flashes of scenery and action were shown. HBO has now released a third trailer over the weekend, however,…

                              <span>The SK Hynix Gold P31 is widely considered one of the finest laptop SSDs available - because it&#x27;s not only fast, but it&#x27;s extremely power-efficient. That means it produces little waste heat, and allows your laptop to stretch its legs in terms of battery life too. It&#x27;s normally over $200 for 2TB, but for Prime members it&#x27;s now available for $146 - an almighty deal for this drive.

Today is one of those days, as it turns out The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of The King was built using the modified engine of an undisclosed Tiger Woods title. 
&quot;Lord Of The Rings is about large areas, then a castle at the end or a fortress - what&#x27;s like that?&quot;, asks Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield in the video below. &quot;Tiger Woods&quot;, he answers. 

Huh.

The Pokemon-like MMO&#x27;s 1.2 update introduces Showdown, a ranked competitive ladder where players are free to twiddle with their line-up using simulated Temtems. 
The update also tweaks how PvP ranking works, adds new PvP battle zones, and a beauty centre where you can tweak your character&#x27;s appearance. There&#x27;s a new season of cosmetic doodads, too.

                              <span>Season 2 of Overwatch 2 arrives tomorrow, and it&#x27;s a bigger deal than it may sound. Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard&#x27;s venerable hero shooter, but it&#x27;s the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.
I got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2&#x27;s second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I&#x27;ve come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don&#x27;t seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.

                              <span>Sad news, card pals: CD Project Red are pulling back from Gwent, with no new cards to be added after 2023. Beyond that the servers will stay online but the devs don&#x27;t intend to release updates themselves, instead handing responsibility for balance changes over to the community via in-game tools. 
Six years of active development seems like a pretty good run, to be fair.

BioWare have now revealed a sneak peek at an early cutscene, in which chirpy dwarf Varric muses about his old companion/possible ancient Elven god Solas. He&#x27;s the big bad, you see. The Dreadwolf himself.
BioWare have also released a few bits and bobs in celebration of Dragon Age day, including posters for upcoming Netflix show Dragon Age: Absolution, which is out on Friday. I hope it doesn&#x27;t do a Dota.

                              <span>Grab your lute and set off for adventure in Stomp Plonk, a lovely new indie game about exploring a musical fantasy land. Delightfully, its soundtrack is built from loops tied to the animations of people doing things around the world: xylophone plings from little guys tossing coins into a fountain; drum beats from jesters dancing or goblins smashing dead gnomes; barbershop mutterings from pipe-smoking fishermen; long horns from passing ships; organ notes from giant seabirds stretching their necks; and so many more. A bit like Proteus meets Bernband and Alien Caseno with the added ability to make annoying noises by slamming on your lute.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s proposed buyout of Activision-Blizzard is currently being scrutinized by competition regulators in various countries, but despite previous (and existing) objections the American Federal Trade Commision now looks likely to approve the deal. The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. 
There&#x27;s a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan&#x27;s authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it.

                              <span>As I write this I&#x27;m installing the PC patch for The Callisto Protocol, which will hopefully fix the stuttering that I experienced (that everyone on PC experienced, judging by the steam reviews). I will report back. But there&#x27;s another issue that I was still working out my feelings about when I wrote the review, and is a complext thing to explain. It is this:
The Callisto Protocol wants you to learn and experiment with its systems, but it strongly disincentivises this at the same time.

                              <span>Playing Kynseed is kind of like being allowed too much freedom at the pick-n-mix. It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
Kynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.

Ever since Pokémon releases have started to get closer and closer together, we&#x27;ve started to see more 8in-game references to the next game in the series long before it gets announced.
In Pokémon X and Y, there was a &quot;Strange Souvenir&quot; that hinted at a future location — which would turn out to be Sun and Moon&#x27;s Alola. In Sword and Shield, many people speculated that the wallpaper in Hotel Ionia, emblazoned with oranges and grapes, was a subtle hint at the orange/grape theming of Scarlet and Violet. Likewise, the Diamond and Pearl remakes at the end of 2021 had some scarlet and violet flowers that seemed a little too purposeful to be an accident.

One of our favourite new features in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has to be the new Pokédex. Instead of being a dry encyclopaedic list of Pokémon you&#x27;ve seen and caught, ScarVi takes the boring old &#x27;Dex formula and throws it out of the window in favour of a stylish bookcase of Pokémon. And it&#x27;s gorgeous.
We began to notice that some of these &quot;book covers&quot; had a little personality to them after catching a few &#x27;mons, and as we evolved those &#x27;mons, we realised that some of them had stories, too. So we&#x27;ve gathered up some of our favourites in the hopes that you can appreciate them just as much as we do!

                              <span>Going off-scrypt.
The delight of Daniel Mullins’ games is the way they obliterate expectations. If there’s a problem with having such a distinctive creative voice, though, is that we&#x27;ve been trained by his previous games to expect the unexpected. And that&#x27;s why Inscryption&#x27;s arrival on Switch is such a treat: as the first of Mullins&#x27; games to hit the console, many Switch owners won’t have had the chance to play his earlier works. If you’re one of them, you’re in for a treat.
The Switch home screen icon for Inscryption is a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The game loads with a flickery CRT filter over the production logos and then frames the whole work as a dusty old computer game that hasn&#x27;t been played in a long time. That game is a card game, played against a mysterious Dungeon Master-type figure. However, within minutes, it becomes apparent that your eerie foe isn&#x27;t talking to you, the player of the computer game, but to an in-game avatar who is playing the card game inside the computer game. So before you’ve even sat comfortably, Inscryption has you playing a game within a game within a game.

It was back at the start of November that The Pokémon Company announced the first contenders in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s Tera Raid Battles, and now it looks like we know who is going to be turning all crystal-y next.
Following on from Eevee and Charizard, the next &#x27;mon to be stepping up to the plate in the game&#x27;s limited-time Tera events will be Tyranitar and Salamence from 9th-11th December. This time, the two leads will differ depending on which version of the game you own. Tyranitar will be the focus of Pokémon Scarlet, while Pokémon Violet will have Salamence.

The update for Disney Dreamlight Valley is almost here, bringing with it a new Toy Story realm, new characters, new fashion, and a bunch more stuff that we can&#x27;t even guess. But ahead of the December 6th Toy Story update, the Disney DLV Twitter account is showing off some hints at what&#x27;s to come — including some new recipes for the game.
The Disney theme parks are renowned for their exclusive treats and sweets, and the Mickey Gingerbread is a seasonal offering that&#x27;s only available during Christmas. But in Disney Dreamlight Valley, it&#x27;ll be available all year round, and presumably it&#x27;ll be a great way to use up your massive store of ginger, too.

It&#x27;s safe to say that we all love Switch games, but you know what&#x27;s better? Free Switch games. Fortunately, No Gravity Games is once again giving them out by the sack-load this December (if by &#x27;sack-load&#x27; you mean a maximum of 12, that is) as a part of the &#x27;12 Games of Christmas&#x27; - hey, it&#x27;s certainly one way of getting games out there.
The event begins today (5th December) and will run through until 16th December with a brand new game being made available for free on each day. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning right off the bat that this offer only applies to North American eShop accounts.

Swordship looks like something from the world of Wipeout, except here the race is for your life. With buttery cel-shaded graphics and a cool ambient techno soundtrack, it&#x27;s stylistically polished. The frame rate maintains a perfect 60 FPS, with its industrial periphery altering between cities and the colour of the seas moving through several pastel shades.
In a post-apocalyptic future, the fortunate have taken root in megacities beneath the seas. Rogue pilots who fight for the banished race down waterways looking for stray containers, grabbing them when they surface and delivering them via a portal. Pegged as a ‘dodge &#x27;em up’, Swordship is just that, confining you to a volatile rectangular area where you use everything at your disposal to stay afloat.

We first heard about UnderDungeon back in the sunny days of August. With it&#x27;s somewhat Undertale-y vibe and interesting mix of 2D and 3D dungeon exploration, we were excited for it&#x27;s release this year. While it looks like it will be just missing out on that original date, the publisher has announced that it will be landing (on its feet, of course) on Switch on 13th January, 2023 (thanks, Go Nintendo).
If the game has somehow slipped your mind since we last heard about it in the summer, allow us to refresh your memory. UnderDungeon is a 1-bit dungeon crawler where you play as Kimuto, a cat delivery driver tasked with cutting down enemies and bosses with a variety of weapons from the Zelda-like (hookshots, boomerangs, swords) to the not-so Zelda-like (magical bubbles).

Back in 2018 we were completely enamoured by Dead Cells. A roguelite with gorgeous pixel art and enough intense action to fill many hours of play time, the game was, simply put, a blast. Now Sébastien Benard, the title&#x27;s lead developer, is taking that sense of blast all the more literally, as their latest game, Nuclear Blaze, will see us tackling fires, explosions and the mystery behind a secret military facility (thanks, Eurogamer).
Revealed in the above announcement trailer, Nuclear Blaze will scorch its way (digitally) onto Switch on 28th April, 2023, with a physical release also coming from Red Art Games.

                              <span>From Pokéballs to footballs.
The UK boxed charts are in and this week continues the World Cup-inspired triumph of FIFA 23, with the latest entry in EA&#x27;s football series taking home the trophy once again.
It is a slightly quieter one for Nintendo this week, with the other home consoles dominating the top three spots. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet drop down a number of places once again - not that this really affects their record-breaking opening - and Sonic Frontiers continues to hang on in the top 10 after those stellar Black Friday discounts persuaded many on Switch to give it a go (the Switch accounted for 36% of the game&#x27;s total sales, while the PS5 took home 38% and the Xbox Series and PS4 made up 14% and 11% respectively).

                              <span>Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.
Meet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. 


Palworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you&#x27;re catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we&#x27;re still not entirely convinced it&#x27;s a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. 
Thankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we&#x27;ll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.</span>

                              <span>Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. 
Lost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. 


Despite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. 
Lost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Be sure also to check out our related series on video games in development hell.</span>

Following the Fracture live event on December 3rd, the Herald and her chrome army obliterated The Island, sending chunks flying in all directions across space. Then, the island began repairing itself, forming an entirely new world filled with new locations, weapons, and mechanics. Blindly jumping into an all-new map can be a bit overwhelming, so here’s a list of every change introduced in Fortnite Chapter 4.
  



      
												
A New Island
Chapter 4’s most obvious change is the new map. Mainly split between an icy mountain, an autumnal forest, and a series of farmlands, this area has loads of secrets yet to be discovered. Players that log in now will have the opportunity to complete Explorer Quests, which allows them to get XP by visiting parts of the isl…</span>

                              <span>Father-son picture day kicks off
God of War Ragnarok is making it easier to snap those perfect shots today. Photo mode arrives in God of War Ragnarok today, as part of a major update to the title.
The v3.00 update adds photo mode, which was confirmed to be a post-launch addition ahead of Ragnarok&#x27;s release. Today&#x27;s update adds the option to open photo mode by pressing the Square button while inside the options menu.
The Sony Santa Monica team runs down the options in a new PlayStation blog, showing how God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s photo mode will allow for captures in most places. Whether it&#x27;s overlooking a beautiful vista or in the middle of absolutely annihilating an ancient creature of myth, there is time to snap some pictures.
Features include expressions for main characters in various different scenes. I won&#x27;t list them out here in case you&#x27;re still playing, as some are a bit of a surprise. But you will have some expression control over chunks of God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s core cast.
There are also standard options like hiding characters, adjusting field of view or focal length, shutter controls, and filters with controls for fine adjustments.

Take a picture
Photo modes have become a prominent feature in games over the last generation or so, as consoles have made saving and uploading in-game screenshots easy. For big Sony games, they&#x27;ve often been pretty solid offerings too.
God of War Ragnarok is, from what I&#x27;ve seen, a gorgeous game with a variety of locales to explore. Basically, it seems like good fodder for photo-snapping. And if you&#x27;ve already bought and beat it, now you&#x27;ve got an excuse to trek back over the Nine Realms all over again. The update is live today for all God of War Ragnarok owners.

                              <span>It really is the most wonderful time of the year
I got the chance to review We Are OFK a few months ago, and it turned out to be one of the most pleasant surprises of the year for me. The music was fun, the visuals were beautiful, and it turned out to have some of the best-character focused writing I&#x27;ve seen in games in a long time. We Are OFK turned out to be more of an interactive mini series than a game, but if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing like I am, it&#x27;s definitely one to check out.
Now we just got our first update from the team behind We Are OFK since the game came out back in August, and it&#x27;s kind of a free DLC, of sorts. The band is releasing a holiday song in collaboration with Sony Music Soundtracks -- their own cover of the seasonal classic &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; -- which will be accompanied by an interactive music video like the ones from the base game. I love a good holiday single/album from musical artists I love, so it&#x27;s fun to see OFK getting in on the action. The free update will be available for all players on this Friday, December 9.
https://twitter.com/OFKband/status/1598799498524098561
The next tweet in the thread following the announcement also says that OFK &quot;got offered some special secret collabs.&quot; I have no idea if this is in regards to their music, games, or both, but it sounds like exciting news based on the emojis in said tweet. Based on the Steam reviews for We Are OFK, it looks like I wasn&#x27;t the only one who thoroughly enjoyed the game, so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what the team continues to put out in the future. And of course, I&#x27;d love to see other artists and game designers follow suit, because the industry needs more chill interactive narrative experiences.

                              <span>An early Steam page listing points to March
It looks like we&#x27;re getting some news about the new Star Wars Jedi entry this week. An early Steam page listing seems to point towards a launch date for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, just ahead of this week&#x27;s Game Awards.
Users spotted earlier today that the Steam store page for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor had been updated with a bunch of information, including a launch date of March 16, 2023. The page was noticed, shared around the internet, and quickly scrubbed, but not before it was read and catalogued by several sites (thanks, Gematsu).
The info arrives ahead of The Game Awards 2022, which airs this Thursday, December 8. Respawn and awards showrunner Geoff Keighley have confirmed that Survivor will be showing off its first gameplay at the show.

Peering into the future
While Electronic Arts and Respawn haven&#x27;t confirmed anything yet, it does look like we&#x27;re getting a look at Survivor either way. The new game is a follow-up to 2019&#x27;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which followed rogue Jedi Cal Kestis as he fled the Empire and mastered his powers.
Meanwhile the sequel Jedi: Survivor picks up five years after Fallen Order. It looks like Cal is still dealing with a universe hostile to the Jedi. But we haven&#x27;t learned too much on what the years mean, or where the conflict has gone, since the conclusion of the first game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4HLDaBGdnLc
If the Steam page info pans out to be accurate, it looks like Cal might be picking up a blaster alongside his trusty lightsaber. Obi-Wan might deem that to be a bit uncivilized, but Cal&#x27;s going through some stuff, so I think we can let it slide.
We&#x27;ll find out more info at The Game Awards 2022 on Thursday, December 8.

                              <span>Flashy fighter to strut its stuff
Bandai Namco has officially confirmed that the next iteration of its flagship fighting franchise is getting to make an appearance at The Game Awards 2022 — Tekken 8, clumsily/sort-of revealed during EVO earlier this year, will be on deck this Thursday to show off more of its UE 5-based pugilism.
A short teaser, posted to Twitter by the publisher, features the sequel&#x27;s red-hot, chain-based logo, followed by the hashtag &quot;#Savethed8&quot;, alongside a &quot;12/08/22&quot; stamp — conveniently the day of The Game Awards.
Tekken 8 was first hinted at/revealed during a confusing segment at the end of the Tekken leg of EVO 2022. Following a presentation that did not, in fact, reveal Tekken 8 at all, the hosts were instructed to basically &quot;go crazy&quot; as if they had just seen a major reveal — leaving viewers scratching in their heads as to what was so dang exciting. The situation was cleared up at the Sony State of Play presentation in September, where Bandai Namco officially announced the sequel along with an impressive first trailer.
https://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1598739581381349394?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;arkfL9EHBOU4UWpdS71Y7g
 
Tekken 8, the latest entry in a franchise dating right back to PlayStation&#x27;s launch days, will utilize the power of Unreal Engine 5, presenting character models and effects unlike those seen in the series to date. Bandai Namco has already noted that the new fighter is being built for PC and current-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X only, suggesting that some pretty hefty hardware will be required for those running local tournaments. Onnly two characters have been officially revealed to date, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama, but we can probably expect more combatants to be revealed this Thursday.
Tekken 8 is in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. The Game Awards kicks off December 8.

                              <span>Big first-party Xbox Series X|S titles will see a price hike, including Starfield
Xbox manufacturer Microsoft has confirmed it&#x27;s bumping up the price of its major first-party games. The tag on a new major Xbox game in 2023 will be going from $60 up to $70.
IGN broke the news that Microsoft&#x27;s major, built-for-Xbox Series games are seeing a tick up to $69.99 USD. Regional pricing may differ, though specifics have not been outlined yet.
A spokesperson told IGN that the price reflect &quot;the content, scale and technical complexity&quot; of the games. Titles seeing the bump will still be available on launch with Xbox Game Pass.
This $70 price point will apply to some of the Xbox heavy-hitters for the new year, including Forza Motorsport, Redfall, and Starfield.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zmb2FJGvnAw
The price of the game
Xbox head Phil Spencer said in October that he did think the company would, at some point, have to raise prices &quot;on certain things.&quot; The price point was going to stick headed into the holidays, but once we&#x27;re into 2023, that will see the tag finally shift.
It&#x27;s a bump that several other companies have already made, too. PlayStation has hiked its prices up to $70 for its blockbuster first-party games, and publishers like Ubisoft have made similar moves. Others, like Capcom, haven&#x27;t made the shift.
This comes amid a move to hike the price of hardware, too. Sony has also increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in select regions. And on the VR side of things, the Meta Quest 2 saw a price hike earlier this year.
Microsoft declined to comment to IGN about any potential console price increases.
Frequently, the rising cost of development has been cited as a factor in price increases. But as those initial tags go up, it certainly does make Xbox Game Pass seem like a good offer.

Overwatch 2 is fully engulfed in its launch season, following on from its October launch across PC and console platforms. And while players are already getting to grips with newer heroes such as Junker Queen, Soujourn, and the powerful healer Kiriko, developer Activision Blizzard is already prepping the way for the first character of Season 2, the powerful Omnic monk, Ramattra.
A Tank class character, Ramattra seems immediately comparable with OG OW hero Zenyatta, both characters being spiritual beings of Omnic build. Quite unlike Zenyatta, however, Ramattra has a far more aggressive nature — having initially been built as a war machine during the Omnic Crisis. As a Ravager model, Ramattra only knew violence and combat — laying waste to his enemies during the extended b…</span>

I suspect that there&#x27;s a pretty sizable chunk of people who would gladly call the Metroidvania their favorite video game genre, but who have never played a Metroid game. That&#x27;s a problem. Sometimes, when a classic is too classical, it can become a bit of a headache. Revisiting a really beloved game can become a chore when you&#x27;ve seen its best ideas executed better by games that came later.
Not so with Metroid. Nearly every 2D Metroid game is still a very good time, even when placed next to the wave of wonderful indie Metroidvanias we&#x27;ve seen recently. Unfortunately, &quot;nearly&quot; is the operative word in that sentence. There are definitely downright bad 2D Metroid games, just as there are great ones. So allow me to walk you through every 2D Metroid game, from the clunky…</span>

As the year is nearing its end, Riot Games is spotlighting one of its League spin-offs. Project L, the League of Legends fighting game in development at Riot Games, got a new gameplay deep-dive today, showing off its tag system and battles in even more detail.
First revealed in 2019, the still-codenamed Project L looks to take the brawls of Runeterra and bring them into the 2D fighting arena. Today, executive producer Tom Cannon and game director Shaun Rivera talked a little bit about the actual systems at work in Project L.
While the project started out as a one-on-one fighter, according to Rivera, the team swapped to a tag system about two years ago. Fights in Project L are two-on-two, much like BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle or the first Marvel Vs. Capc…</span>

This week will see the return of The Game Awards, as the great and good of 2022&#x27;s run of digital entertainment gather together in hopes of bagging some recognition for their efforts — all squeezed between endless game trailers and piss-break live entertainment. It&#x27;s usually a long affair... a really long affair. Last year&#x27;s event, including the pre-show, clocked in around the four hour mark.
However, as reported by VGC, host and organizer Geoff Keighley has seemingly taken some of the tired-eyed feedback of TGA viewers and media types on board, suggesting that this year&#x27;s event should be a little less bum-numbing.
&quot;One thing we’re doing this year is we’re trying to make the show a little bit shorter,&quot; Keighley said in a Twitter-based audio stream. &quot;I won’t say anything offici…</span>

Nexon&#x27;s great fighter DNF Duel might not have exactly taken the world by storm, but it&#x27;s still alive and kicking thanks to its slick action, wild combat, and fun roster of characters — and that roster is about to get a little bigger, with the reveal of the game&#x27;s first post-release DLC fighter, Spectre.
Very little has been revealed about this sultry swordswoman, save for her fleeting appearance in this brief teaser trailer. With flowing pink hair, a dual sword set, and a clear eye for fashion, Spectre has looks that kill with an attitude to match. Unfortunately, we were not granted a release date for her grand debut, though one would expect that this mysterious new fighter will enter the ring at some point in 2023.

This past weekend was a huge one for Epic Games juggernaut release, Fortnite — Not only did Season 2 Chapter 3 come to its conclusion via Saturday&#x27;s earth-shaking &quot;Fracture&quot; event, but it was followed by the reveal of a litany of new content headed to the defining battle royale release. Hidden among all this excitement, however, was some important news for those who build &#x27;n&#x27; brawl on PC via Windows.
As of Chapter 4 Season 2, The PC edition of Fortnite will be supported on Windows 10 only, with native official support halting on previous versions, including Windows 7 &amp; 8. Speaking in a statement on its official blog Epic Games noted that, as the game moves forward into the next generation, the developer wishes to secure its future on more contemporary platforms, shut…</span>

                              <span>(Well, a little belatedly, at least)
Yesterday, December 4 might have seemed like any other day, but lo, it was, in fact, Dragon Age Day, and to celebrate the beloved fantasy RPG franchise, Electronic Arts released a new teaser trailer for its long-in-development, long-time-coming sequel Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.
The cinematic preview, unfortunately, offers not a dot of gameplay footage, and in fact only runs a scant 60 seconds in length, (truly you are spoiling us). Still, it does give fans something of a re-introduction to the mysterious and wise mage, Solas, also known by his pseudonym of Fen&#x27;Harel — The Dreadwolf. Legend tells of a cataclysmic battle that saw Solas seal away both the Creators and The Forgotten Ones, preventing both all-powerful beings from ever again becoming involved in mortal events.
This event was known as The Great Betrayal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;z06j2aQSCLM&amp;t
Having all but vanished from existence since performing this almighty deed, it seems that Solas has returned, with a plan to break the seals and wreak chaos and destruction among the worlds. According to the dwarf warrior Varric Tethras, who narrates this preview, it will be up to the player&#x27;s party to stop The Dreadwolf and prevent this frightening act of annihilation from ever coming to pass.
The new trailer is probably a little underwhelming to those fans who might have been expecting a little more for this year&#x27;s DA Day, but it looks like the waiting with have to continue a little longer as developer BioWare continues its work on the epic sequel. Additionally, it is worth remembering that this week sees the arrival of the new animated series Dragon Age: Absolution, which will premiere on Netflix from December 9.
Dragon Age Dreadwolf is currently in development at BioWare.

It&#x27;s technically the last eShop Selects of the year. Yep, the next time we do this, it&#x27;ll be 2023, even if we&#x27;ll be looking back at December&#x27;s games.
But let&#x27;s not get too far ahead of ourselves yet! We&#x27;ve got November to look back on — a month dominated by Pokémon, but an early Indie World presentation meant we got a few surprise releases on the eShop. Have any of them made a dent? Let&#x27;s find out in Nintendo Life&#x27;s picks for the best games on the Switch eShop games of last month!

                              <span>That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m doing listicles on weekends now
Easily one of the most-anticipated games of 2023 is Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2. As the follow-up to the highly successful Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the PlayStation 5 exclusive Spider-Man 2 will introduce Venom to the series and there is still some speculation the game will include some form of co-op, even though Insomniac Games has denied this. Whichever way it goes, you can be sure that the game will be at the top of many Game of the Year lists come next December.
As I shiver in anticipation for that game, I&#x27;m often tempted to boot up some of the older Spider-Man games I have scattered around the various game devices I&#x27;ve collected over the years. Peter Parker has shown up in a wide array of games, starting back in the 1980s wit…</span>

Good day and good weekend, friends of Destructoid! I hope all of my friends in the U.S. of A. enjoyed their Thanksgiving/Turkey Day weekends, and that the extended holiday offered you a little respite from the weekly grind. Today, as the cold, cold tendrils of my office tell me, we have hit December, and the final month of the year, Yep, just like that, 2022 is preparing to make its way outta the door, donning aviator shades and with a shit-eating &quot;Deal With It&quot; grin on its face. Thanks for that.
Still, we shall focus on the smaller picture, namely this week, this weekend, and the fine times that the coming days will bring to you, to me, and to all of us. Because, dear readers, it&#x27;s Whatcha Been Playing?

                              <span>Another chapter, another season of skins to collect
Following yesterday&#x27;s somewhat longwinded finale to the third chapter of Fortnite, the game is finally back online with Chapter 4 Season 1. At the end of the last chapter, spectators watched as the game&#x27;s island was destroyed and then slowly reassembled. For Fortnite Chapter 4, that means getting to know this island from scratch once more. What locations are in? Which ones are out? And most importantly, what do I get if I buy the season pass this time?
Some of those questions are answered in the launch trailer below. As teased in the cinematic trailer released on Saturday, Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher is in, as is Doom Guy. My Hero Academia is getting some representation too with Izuku Midoriya. Also, dirt bikes. Lots and lots of dirt bikes.

That map looks like it&#x27;ll be fun to explore though I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t miss the days when there was a massive cliffside and waterfall right smack in the middle of it.
As for that season pass, Doom Guy is available starting on page 5 with the rest of the skins for the season belonging to original characters, including The Ageless. Geralt will get his own set of missions that&#x27;ll unlock later this season.
With the update to Fortnite Chapter 4, current-gen graphics have arrived for the game. Even though I predominantly play on Xbox Series S, I can see some serious changes in how Unreal Engine 5.1 is handling the game. Especially the lighting. The lighting is gorgeous. In fact, I&#x27;m tempted to download it to my PS5 to see if there are further improvements my Series S isn&#x27;t doing.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for strategy games which boil their mechanics down until they almost become puzzle games, particularly if they also involve building rather than war. I&#x27;m thinking of games like Concrete Jungle, Slipways, Terra Nil and now, maybe, Farlanders.

That last game may be less familiar. Farlanders is a turn-based strategy game about terraforming Mars via building placement and adjacency bonuses, and it&#x27;s due for release next month.

                              <span>There are so many games released each year that I sometimes only notice a couple of years after the fact. Unfortunately that&#x27;s sometimes long enough for a game to be unreleased again. So it is with Fuser, Harmonix&#x27;s 2020 music game in which players create new works by mashing up other people&#x27;s songs. It&#x27;s being delisted from sale later this month and its &quot;live services&quot; are being switched off.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not tv, it&#x27;s not video games, it&#x27;s HBO
Arguably one of the most anticipated new shows of 2023 is the HBO adaptation of The Last of Us, the hit PlayStation game that spawned a million bad takes about storytelling. We&#x27;ve been talking about this show for quite some time and now we&#x27;re just weeks away from its debut. After a couple of short video teases and character posters, the producers of the sure-to-be-viral show finally dropped the debut trailer. And hey, what do you know? It looks like another high-quality production from HBO.

Music choice aside, I think that&#x27;s a pretty dope trailer and certainly has my hopes up that this will be better than that lousy House of the Dragon show. Of course, with the production team working on The Last of Us, I have some pretty high expectations. Chernobyl is one of the most unsettling shows I&#x27;ve ever seen and considering this IP is Neil Druckmann&#x27;s baby, I highly doubt he&#x27;d want anything reaching the airwaves that doesn&#x27;t live up to its legacy. Add in a stellar cast and some great visuals, and this show is giving me a reason to restart my HBO Max subscription even if the guy running things over at Warner Bros. Discovery is a real piece of work.
The Last of Us will debut on January 15 on HBO and HBO Max. That&#x27;s plenty of time to beat the game if you&#x27;re someone like more who got bored of the whole thing halfway through and hasn&#x27;t picked it up since.

Even if you don&#x27;t play Fortnite, odds are you&#x27;ve heard of the Chapter 3 ending event: Fracture. It took place earlier today, and in a classic dramatic end-of-chapter fashion, a new island was forged.
Here&#x27;s what happened!

The Chapter 3 Fracture event kicked off at 4:10PM ET
Although the predetermined start time was 4:00PM ET, there&#x27;s a customary wait for events to actually kick off; which was also the case with Fracture (10 minutes, here). After queuing up, my party was warped to a very small island with a TV, which displayed a countdown ticker.
After the time was up, a cutscene played, which showcased The Herald (the big bad of this season) fighting a group of resistance members. Although it seemed like they …</span>

                              <span>Let&#x27;s get this party started.
The Final Fantasy series might be the single most popular party-based JRPG series ever made. Since the release of the very first game all the way back in 1987, every single numbered entry in the series has had a crew of one kind or another. 35 years later, nearly everyone who&#x27;s ever played one of these things has a favorite party member, a companion who&#x27;s stuck by them through thick or thin. An old pal who&#x27;s been handy on the battlefield and friendly in the overworld.
In some ways, it&#x27;s impossible to list the five best party members in the history of Final Fantasy. The five &quot;best&quot; party members for most people will ultimately end up being the protagonist and four of the strongest characters from their favorite game. To avoid falling into that trap, I&#x27;ve decide…</span>

                              <span>A surprising new retro project
Well-regarded composer and engineer Yuzo Koshiro is working on a new game for an old system. He&#x27;s putting together a game for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.
Koshiro shared some pictures of the project, running on an old TV to boot, over on his Twitter. It may look old, but it&#x27;s a new game &quot;harkening back&quot; to famous franchises from the &#x27;80s, according to Koshiro.
His team plans to release this game for the Mega Drive (or Genesis in North America). They&#x27;re considering a few different ideas for launching it, including selling actual physical carts.
Koshiro posted a series of tweets digging into the design and development of this project. He says the team wants to respect games of the days they love, and will make a game with a &quot;new system, fascinating graphics, characters, and a soundtrack.&quot;
https://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro/status/1597788200491442176
Alongside the soundtrack, Koshiro is also back as a designer. He wants to make the difficulty &quot;manageable,&quot; and make it so everyone playing the game can clear all the stages in easy mode.
As for the music, Koshiro will be going for some of the classic tools. It&#x27;s the first time about three decades he&#x27;s worked on Mega Drive, so that&#x27;s a pretty exciting prospect.
A classic throwback
Koshiro has garnered well-deserved acclaim for his composition and sound work in games, with Streets of Rage being one of the obvious highlights. Knowing Koshiro&#x27;s back not just for some new tunes, but a new game on the Mega Drive, is some exciting news for retro fans.

The composer&#x27;s been busy, too. Alongside this new project, Yuzo Koshiro is also set to contribute some tracks to Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight studio Yacht Club Games.

Given how quickly Google gave up on Stadia, a part of me that is genuinely surprised Apple Arcade is still alive and kicking. The subscription service for Apple devices made big waves when it debuted in 2019, but the chatter around it has been fading. It had a strong year last year with the debut of Fantasian and several other high-profile titles, but the 2022 Apple Arcade release schedule has been as quiet as a church mouse. There were no big-name games to speak of this year that were exclusive to the platform, and looking ahead to 2023, it&#x27;s hard to know whether or not anyone should keep their $5-a-month subscription going.
Despite the lack of headlines, Apple Arcade did see a decent number of memorable games in 2022. Chief among them was…</span>

Launching in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master was the biggest challenge offered to block-dropping fans to date. While TGM, (as it is known by the Tetris community), follows the typical rules and methodology of Alexey Pajitnov&#x27;s world-best puzzler, this particular edition offered up a marathon 999 levels to be conquered as well as the dazzling &quot;20G&quot; mechanic to truly push expert players to their limits.

Out of the games I played this year that had some reasonable budget and were perhaps a bit more conventional, Two Point Campus stands out as a clear favorite. I had expectations going in, and while they weren’t substantially exceeded, they were certainly all met. It was one of the few games that, after writing my review of it, I wanted to delve back into. And I did, before I inevitably had to move my focus elsewhere.
I knew I was going to return to it the second DLC dropped for it, and here it is with Space Academy. I figured it was an eventuality since Two Point Hospital was fortified with extra scenarios. It’s not like Two Point Campus feels limited or barebones, but if you want more Two Point Campus, here it is: in space.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 has officially come to a close. 
Chapter 3 began last December and now, we officially know Chapter 4 begins tomorrow, December 4. Like with previous chapter launches, Chapter 4 brings with it an all-new map to play on that will be filled with new locations and returning favorites. There&#x27;s a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 &quot;A New Beginning&quot; trailer, which you can watch below: 


Here&#x27;s another look at the Chapter 4 map: 
Elsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. 
Before all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 &quot;Fracture&quot; finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. 
Players were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. 

Fortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed.

                              <span>HBO has released a new trailer for The Last of Us, its upcoming TV series based on the hit Naughty Dog game of the same name. And it looks awesome (and sad...very, very sad). 
The show&#x27;s first bit of footage was released back in August and slowly, HBO has been revealing more and more about The Last of Us. We&#x27;ve seen Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in previous footage, but today&#x27;s trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: 


As you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David&#x27;s henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we&#x27;ll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):

                              <span>Dudunsparce is already the biggest joke of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Pokédex. There’s almost no visible difference between this new Pokémon and its pre-evolution Dunsparce save for an extra segment on its body. Even still, yours could be special.

Now, having been out since June on other platforms, PlayStation owners will finally be able to play the game.

                              <span>Google have started issuing refunds for their recently canned game streaming service, Stadia. Those who&#x27;d bought any games, hardware or add-ons have already been told they&#x27;ll get their money back by January 18th, which is when the lights go out and all access to Stadia games shuts off.
The situation sucks for the Stadia team, and the numerous developers who were caught short by Google&#x27;s failure to communicate Stadia&#x27;s imminent demise. If you&#x27;ve spent the past three years mostly buying games through Stadia though then crikey, that&#x27;s a nice windfall.

                              <span>Within the joyful depths of tabletop board gaming lies a genre known as &#x27;take-that&#x27; style card games. They revolve around people pulling out cards that suddenly give them extra power or abilities, with counterplays almost entirely dependent on whether you happen to draw the right card in response. Munchkin is the king of these, at least in terms of popularity, having sent millions of players all over the world into dungeons where they competitively slay goofy horrors. 

I cannot stand it, but it is now on Steam in early access, and statistically speaking a lot of people will be very happy about that.

Hordes of people on Steam are reporting the same issues that Alice Bee did in her review, plonking Callisto&#x27;s rating into Mostly Negative. Developers Striking Distance Studios have acknowledged the issue and say they&#x27;ll drop a patch later today to fix it, but we&#x27;ll see.
They&#x27;ve also revealed their post-launch roadmap, so hopefully it&#x27;ll run well enough by February for you to enjoy the New Game+ and Hardcore modes.

                              <span>Unlike buses, Valve games do not come in threes. That isn&#x27;t about to change anytime soon, but one of the main writers behind both Portal games has revealed that they&#x27;ve got a &quot;pretty awesome&quot; idea for Portal 3. Erik Wolpaw say he and fellow Portal 2 penner Jay Pinkerton have even floated that idea around Valve, to a positive response. It&#x27;s totes on the cards, is what it sounds like.  
The news comes from Wolpaw&#x27;s recent interview with YouTuber DidYouKnowGaming, which is also worth a watch to learn about all the ideas Valve didn&#x27;t wind up using in Portal 2. At one point it had bullet time.

                              <span>My keyboard is broken, so this has been a fun week of workarounds that sort of work but not quite enough to play most things. That&#x27;ll teach me to spend more than the £5 one that lasted for a decade I guess.
Fortunately, a few of the little turn based tactics games I&#x27;d had on the backburner for a while was Immortal Tactics Colon War of the Eternals, an excellent little fantasy combat game set on miniature hex grids. On paper, it&#x27;s a stock fantasy game with a himbo, edgelord, and nerd fighting to kill monsters and unlock new characters. But what does paper know?

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide launched on November 30th following several weeks of pre-order beta, but some players are already rather ticked off that the full-price game includes microtransactions. In particular, Darktide players are miffed that the co-op action game offers bundles of its Aquila premium currency that fall just short of the cost of some items in the store, meaning you’d have to stump up for several bundles to afford those. Taking to Darktide’s Discord to ask why you can’t just buy a specific amount of Aquilas for the items you want, one player was told by a spokesperson for Fatshark that adding such a feature would be “immeasurably complex”.

                              <span>I was dismissive of my first few games of Marvel Snap, intrigued by the next few, then hooked within ten. Second Dinner&#x27;s lightning-fast CCG manages to pack a surprising amount of nuance and strategy within six turns, while cleverly leaning on that brevity to play around with ideas that wouldn&#x27;t work elsewhere. It&#x27;s neat! And free! You should try it. 
All the more so, now that the latest update has added Collector Tokens that let you buy specific cards rather than leaving you solely at the mercy of booster packs. There are also 16 new cards, nerfs to some old ones, and a smattering of other improvements.

                              <span>At the beginning of November, we announced we were going to write a bumper crop of supporter articles for the month to celebrate the launch of our new introductory offer on our monthly Standard subscriptions. Normally, these exclusive supporter articles are reserved for our Premium subscription tier, but because we wanted to give those Standard introductory folks a taste of what Premium has to offer as well, we decided to make a bunch of them visible to all subscribers.  
About a week into November, we realised that we didn&#x27;t have a very good way of flagging which of those articles Standard subscribers could actually read (our bad), and due to a combination of holidays, illness and general busy-ness, we completely failed to come up with a solution. Apologies! To remedy that, I&#x27;ve now listed all of them below. Enjoy!

If you reckon you&#x27;d like to cover PC gaming for RPS then read on.

The work experience programme is only for applicants from ethnic minorities who live in the UK, and applications are open from now until the end of January. We&#x27;d love for you to join us, so check out the entry requirements and get in touch.

It’s set in a slick-looking metropolis positioned by the sea called Rockay City, check. The Epic Games Store is involved somehow, got it. Oh, and let’s get Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home actor Michael Madsen in to drop Geoff Keighley’s lost wallet off at The Game Awards HQ, yeah. He’s Geoff’s biggest fan after all. Excuse me? I don’t understand.

                              <span>An appeal made by Activision Blizzard that blocked Blizzard Albany’s QA staff from unionising has been rejected by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). GIbiz report the publisher tried to argue that the entire staff of Blizzard Albany should vote on the unionisation effort rather than just the development studio’s QA team, but the NLRB disagree.

Capcom have announced that Monster Hunter Rise will hit Game Pass in January 2023, a great entry in their brill beast-bashing series. Microsoft have also detailed some more of the games coming to Game Pass before then, including Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga next week. That one might be a fun way to distract the kiddywinkles over Christmas. Read on for more future Game Pass additions.

                              <span>Sometimes when we get sent review code for a game, the PR will say that they&#x27;ll be getting PC code later, but if we want we can have a console code so we can get a head start playing the game. There are a lot of reasons that might happen, but I&#x27;ll be honest: it&#x27;s never a great sign. I&#x27;m usually pretty chillaxed about the occasional wonky animation or frame stuttering when a game runs, but in this case The Callisto Protocol runs so badly on PC that if it were my child and the coach wasn&#x27;t putting it in to play football - even as a sub in the last five minutes, you know, just to give it a go, like - I&#x27;d be saying, &quot;Yeah, bench the sucker, I get it.&quot;
The stuttering and slowing down whenever anything moves is especially problematic in a horror game where your survival depends on quickly dodge-reacting to sudden threats. So I can&#x27;t, right now, recommend you get The Callisto Protocol on PC. If Striking Distance get it running properly? Eh. Maybe.

Following the studio’s successful Kickstarter earlier this year, Game Informer sheds light on Mina The Hollower’s origins as developer Alec Faulkner’s side project, how he pitched the game to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team hopes to deliver a game as prolific as Shovel Knight.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Play enough games, and you start to develop an eye for the ones that are going to demand a lot of your time and focus. Within minutes, I knew Firaxis’ comic book-powered adventure with the Marvel superheroes would be one of those games, filled as it is with numerous currencies, cosmetics, and gameplay systems. Midnight Suns is a strategy/RPG of tremendous depth, character development in both storytelling and upgrade…</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol, Glen Schofield&#x27;s spiritual successor to his Dead Space series, is finally out and to celebrate the day, Striking Distance Studios has released a content plan detailing six months of DLC for the game. 
As previously announced, The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s season pass DLC will feature brand-new death animations, presumably to be featured in the game&#x27;s new story content. According to this new content timeline, that additional story is expected to release sometime next summer. Before that, though, all players will receive New Game+ and a Hardcore Mode while season pass owners will also get the outer way skin collection, the contagion bundle, the riot bundle, and the aforementioned story content.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise is embarking on a new hunt on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in January. Its recent expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, will follow suit sometime next Spring. 
The latest entry in the uber-popular series comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 20. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console, PC, and cloud at launch. The current-gen versions specifically boast 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay, and 3D audio, among other customizable options. However, a disclaimer on a new trailer states that 3D Audio will come to the Xbox One version in a Spring update. The PS5 port also supports DualSense haptic feedback for ranged and shielded weapons. The game is priced at $39.99 across all platforms. 


Monster Hunter Rise first launched in March 2021 for Switch before migrating to PC in January of this year. Sunbreak made its way to both platforms this past June. In addition to this news, Capcom reveals that Rise has sold over 11 million units since its launch.

                              <span>Neon White is finally making its way to PlayStation consoles, roughly six months after the game&#x27;s initial release on Switch and PC. 
Publisher Annapurna Interactive and developer Angel Matrix announced this news today, revealing that Neon White hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on December 13. This fast-paced, speedrunning FPS is well worth your time if you haven&#x27;t played it yet and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Neon White review. 


&quot;Neon White is a lightning fast single-player speedrunning FPS where players sacrifice their guns for godlike parkour moves,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Assume the role of White, an assassin handpicked from Hell, and compete with other demon slayers for a shot at redemption and a chance to live permanently in Heaven. The game utilizes a unique card-based weapon system, bite sized hand-designed levels, and a breakneck soundtrack by Machine Girl to turn players into speedrunning freaks. 
&quot;As players unravel Heaven&#x27;s mysteries, they will discover the other demon slayers are more familiar than they first appear, and through the visual novel inspired story, they learn it&#x27;s never too late to seek forgiveness.&quot; 
Check out this new trailer released today for the game&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation debut:

                              <span>Ubisoft and Bungie have revealed that crossover cosmetics are coming to both Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Destiny 2. 
The items will drop into both respective games next week on December 6 and it&#x27;s then that you&#x27;ll be able to purchase these themed cosmetics from the Assassin&#x27;s Creed in-game store and the Eververse store in Destiny 2. As for what to expect, the image below includes some looks: 
However, that doesn&#x27;t seem to feature all of the cosmetics we can expect to see. If you don&#x27;t feel like waiting until next week to see what makes its way to Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, you can check out MAK Moderator&#x27;s video (as spotted by Forbes) on YouTube below: 


What&#x27;s interesting is that MAK Moderator&#x27;s video also features some Monster Hunter-themed cosmetics, meaning there&#x27;s likely a collaboration with that series set to be announced soon as well. 
&quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla players can purchase a Destiny 2-themed character pack, which includes armor sets, swords, a scout skin, and a mount skin,&quot; Ubisoft&#x27;s announcement reads. &quot;Players can also grab a weapons pack which includes four unique spins on Destiny&#x27;s iconic subclasses, each with their own gameplay perks and custom effects. As Destiny 2 begins its next season on December 6, players will be able to visit the Eververse store to get their hands on an Assassin&#x27;s Creed-themed ship, Sparrow, Ghost, and finisher cosmetics, as well as three armor ornament sets.&quot;

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet hit Switch just a few weeks ago on November 18 and while the game excels at a lot, it struggles on the technical side. Various glitches, bugs, and frame rate drops are present throughout a lot of the game, something we noted in our review, and fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with this aspect of their Paldean journeys. It seems Nintendo is taking these frustrations to heart in a rare admission in the latest update for the game. 
The company tweeted last night that a new software update of Scarlet and Violet was going live today alongside the following: &quot;We take the feedback from players seriously, and will continue to work on improvements to the games.&quot; 


Nintendo further addresses these issues in the actual patch notes for the update too…</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios has released a new trailer for Like A Dragon: Ishin and it features a look at the various combat styles and weaponry we&#x27;ll be using in the game. 
For the uninitiated, Ishin is a from-the-ground-up remake of a Yakuza spinoff released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 back in 2014. However, this spinoff never made its way to the West so when Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February, it will be the first time a lot of players will be able to play this game. To get prepared, RGG Studios has released a brand new trailer detailing some of the combat and associated mechanics present in the game. 
Check out the Like A Dragon: Ishin combat trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;In 1860s Kyo, a solemn samurai&#x27;s fight for justice stands to change the course of Japan&#x27;s history forever,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Draw your blade and join the revolution in this heated historical adventure.&quot; 
Players who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like A Dragon: Ishin will receive early access to the game starting February 17 (the standard release date is February 21) and the following in-game items: 
Shinsengumi Captain&#x27;s Set
Room Growth Support Kit
Sword Upgrade Materials Kit
Gun Upgrade Materials Kit
Third Division Armament Expansion Kit
The Dragon of Dogma Skin
An additional three weapons: 
	
Kijinmaru Kunishige, a dark sword with a white hilt
Bloody Sheen, a sword soaked in blood
Black Ship Cannon, a cannon taken from Western Ships

For more about the game, watch the Like a Dragon: Ishin reveal trailer and then watch this five-minute trailer released back in September. Be sure to read our list of upcoming remakes, which includes Ishin, after that. 
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023.

                              <span>Capcom has announced that the second closed beta test for Street Fighter 6 will begin later this month and you can register for a chance to check the game out during it right now. 
This second beta will officially begin on December 16 and run through December 19 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, and it will feature cross-play across all three platforms. As for what&#x27;s available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6&#x27;s training mode. 


If you&#x27;d like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It&#x27;s important to note, though, that completing Capcom&#x27;s application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You&#x27;ll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well. 
In the meantime, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 cover hub for all kinds of exclusive information and videos about the game. Here&#x27;s a taste of what you can find there:

This is a great pickup for PC gaming, especially if you like platformers, racing games, action titles and the like, of which there are plenty on PC.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers split opinion like most Sonic games do when it released earlier this year. Even Ed in our Sonic Frontiers review was split between finding it fun and frustrating. 

Well, maybe this will help: Sega have announced three updates to come in 2023, all of which will be free, and the last of which will add new playable characters and story.

Path Of Exile 2 had been pencilled in for a 2022 release, but it’s now looking like the sequel could arrive in time for the series’ tenth anniversary. A beta is planned, too, and dates for that will be announced when the game is shown at Exilecon.

                              <span>For the last six months, I&#x27;ve been slowly picking my way through Company Of Heroes 2 for the first time. I&#x27;m about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn&#x27;t quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. 
Imagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3&#x27;s dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I&#x27;ve ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they&#x27;d earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it&#x27;s been a while.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all worn the rose-coloured glasses when it comes to old games. It&#x27;s a real hazard of the job when you started out covering stuff from the 90s. It&#x27;s less common though, to fall afoul of whatever its opposite is. The uh, yellow-tinted glasses, maybe? My point is that I did you all a disservice when I described Emperor Of The Fading Suns as &quot;an intriguing, ambitious, crap mega 4X&quot; last year. It was a remarkable game, and more remarkably still, its developers Holistic Design Inc. recently updated it with a major patch, 25 years after its original release.

It&#x27;s a lot better than I remember. And only some of that is down to the patch.

                              <span>Some games are just December games. When the air turns biting, I hear their siren song in my bones. They Are Billions. Frostpunk. Phoenix Point. Factorio. None of them are exactly what you would call a Christmas-y game. In fact, they&#x27;re all pretty bleak and threatening in tone. But they&#x27;re also amazingly comforting.
Just imagine: sitting down in your favourite chair, electric heat pad on your back, cat on your lap, mug of hot chocolate or coffee by your side. Legions of undead roiling at the gates, trying to break through your cosy little town&#x27;s defences. Ahhhhh. It&#x27;s Christmas.

                              <span>Never ones to be outdone, Valve are partnering with The Game Awards to give away one of their Steam Deck handheld PCs every minute during the three-hour livestream event on December 8th/9th. They&#x27;re the 512GB model too, so you might want to raise an intrigued eyebrow and nod slowly. If you’re wondering which standouts from 2022 are up for awards on the night itself then here’s a video of host Geoff Keighley saying game names for ten minutes, below.

                              <span>With two chunky single player campaigns and a sizable multiplayer component on the way, it&#x27;s no secret that Company Of Heroes 3 is Relic Entertainment&#x27;s biggest COH game yet. After playing a chunky new preview build last week, it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;ll be lots to dive into come release day on February 23rd. But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they &quot;still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly&quot; via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they&#x27;ll go &quot;where the players are&quot;.

                              <span>I knew the hulking Ogryn would be my class in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide as soon as I shot his starting gun: a shotgun which holds a single shell the size of a can of beans. Sounds excessive, but that&#x27;s the kind of firepower you need when four outcasts face thousands of cultists, mutants, and demons. The follow-up to Vermintide is once again a Left 4 Dead-style cooperative first-person shooter with a fair whack of melee and, having played a lot of the beta and a little after launch, it&#x27;s a joyously grubby brawl with a great cast of weirdos.

                              <span>Ray tracing has been temporarily disabled in newly released co-op accent simulator Warhammer 40,000: Darktide due to issues with AMD and Intel graphics cards. Devs Fatshark say they’re looking into what’s causing the problems. Anecdotal reports from the Darktide subreddit seem to suggest that ray tracing was staying on for people who’d set the fancy lighting technique to off. For now, Fatshark say they&#x27;ve turned off ray tracing by default for all players until they can figure out what’s going on and implement a fix.

That&#x27;s just one detail from a nearly 3 hour-long interview Howard gave on the Lex Fridman podcast, where he also talks scrapping space strandings, and (gasp) why he prefers to play on consoles to PC.

                              <span>In a game about someone navigating the competing pressures and existential angst inherent to choosing a career, it seems appropriate that an update would let them sack it all off and go fishing. Sable hasn&#x27;t quite done that, because yesterday&#x27;s update sends you hover-biking off after enough fish to earn the right to don the new, professional mask of a desert angler.
On your bike, then.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 was the first game I ever played in VR. Back in the primordial days of 2013, I was lucky enough to get my ungainly sausage-mitts on an Oculus Developer&#x27;s Kit – the prototype headset that eventually led to the Oculus Rift. Understandably given the name, there were not games for the developers kit outside of a few incredibly basic demos. But there was Half-Life 2, for which Valve had implemented a hacky VR mode that you could activate with some console tomfoolery.

Asassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s free, final content update has arrived a week early, sending Eivor off to North America for one last hurrah.
There are actually two links to Mirage, because this final chapter features *more* of its protagonist, Basim, who Valhalla persevere-ers will have already met. I bailed after 15 hours and so have very little idea what&#x27;s going on, which is a shame because I&#x27;d love a chinwag with Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Wave hello to Makena, Efe, Noor, Kai, Ari, Sunny, and Zuri. Watch the trailer below to see the new default skins teaming up to build a giant alpaca.

                              <span>I&#x27;d argue that Azeroth&#x27;s unending expansion has taken the shine off a world that used to positively sparkle. Still, no matter what I think about World Of Warcraft today, it still holds a special place in my heart as an important formative experience.
Even the time capsule that&#x27;s Classic WoW probably couldn&#x27;t capture the same buzz of the past, mainly because I, as a being of flesh and bone, am not a teenager anymore. But I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s one place that still captures the essence of WoW more than WoW itself nowadays: YouTube. Or to be more specific, channels which provide hour-long music and ambience from some of the game&#x27;s most memorable zones.

                              <span>Being interested in both sci-fi and strategy games, I’ve always wanted to reshape the galaxy. The free 3.6 Orion update for Paradox’s spacey grand strategy Stellaris is live now, and it&#x27;s done that, but in a way I hadn’t quite imagined. Among the changes with this update are six new galaxy shapes to mix up the pattern of your interstellar empires a bit. Orion also rebalances fleet combat, bringing in elements of the open beta that began back in October. Paradox have chucked in a few reworks of bits and pieces from Stellaris’ numerous expansions too, including changes to the Utopia DLC’s Ascension path. You can see more about that by watching the video below.

                              <span>For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in &#x27;if&#x27;s and &#x27;maybe&#x27;s. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It&#x27;s exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we&#x27;ve come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there&#x27;s never any question about whether your moves will or won&#x27;t work here. You&#x27;re playing as the world&#x27;s most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you&#x27;re not already bulletproof, you&#x27;ve certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.

Question is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it&#x27;s easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis&#x27; XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they&#x27;ve come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I&#x27;ve played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.

Its TLC NAND and DRAM cache also mean that performance remains high even in sustained write scenarios, unlike cheaper QLC/no-DRAM drives. 
The Crucial P5 Plus normally costs £100+, but today it&#x27;s down to £92.51 on Amazon UK - one of the best prices we&#x27;ve seen for this model although not quite the best ever.

This season, the game’s taking its inspiration from Greek mythology with a new time-limited mode, Battle For Olympus, giving the heroes some godlike powers early next year. You can take a look at some of what’s lined up for Overwatch 2 Season 2 in the trailer below.

The CPU supports PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, but it also works with cheaper DDR4- and PCIe 4.0-based hardware. 
It&#x27;s normally £200, but it&#x27;s down to £167 on AWD-IT which is a pretty decent deal if you want to build a powerful gaming PC on a budget.

Harvestella wants to be a jack of two trades, but winds up a master of none. Part action-RPG, part farming/life simulation, this combination can sometimes be enjoyable, but the two styles clash more often than not. The result is a sluggish grind more likely to repel fans of each genre than bring them together.
As an amnesiac warrior, you awaken on the outskirts of a quaint village, unaware of your origin and purpose. Four powerful, monolithic crystals called Seaslight govern the environmental stability of the picturesque continent, namely its seasons. However, a …</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI has received a few trailers throughout the year, and it&#x27;s set to hit PlayStation 5 and PC sometime next summer. But an exact release date is still unknown. However, in recent weeks, speculation about a release date reveal has begun to ramp up, with many predicting a FFXVI appearance at The Game Awards next month. 
Today, the official TGA Twitter account added fuel to that fire by revealing that FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, who we interviewed about the game earlier this summer, will be a presenter at the show this year. Plus, he&#x27;s being welcomed to give &quot;a very special live presentation.&quot; What that means remains unknown, but all signs point to something to do with FFXVI. Perhaps he&#x27;ll be playing the game live, or maybe The Game Awards orchestra will do an arrangement from…</span>

                              <span>When Sonic Frontiers came out at the start of November, it received one of the better receptions from fans and critics of any 3D Sonic the Hedgehog title. In my review, I praised many elements of Sonic Team&#x27;s first &quot;open-zone&quot; attempt, but my main takeaway was, &quot;I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries.&quot; While those future entries are likely years away, the developer today gave us a glimpse into how it plans to expand Sonic Frontiers throughout 2023 through a content roadmap.
The Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…</span>

                              <span>Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.
Goodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. 


KO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. 
Goodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>The developers of the Yakuza series say that the beloved cabaret mini game will return in Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. That&#x27;s good news for anyone who played Yakuza 0 and found it weirdly compelling to wring salarymen from their wallets by plying them with drinks.

                              <span>Far Cry continues to take a liberal approach to its expansions with Lost Between Worlds. The DLC for Far Cry 6 takes Dani Rojas, the protagonist from the base game&#x27;s daft revolutionary narrative, and traps her within a kaleidoscopic and extraterrestrial version of Yara. There you&#x27;ll need to work with an alien AI to collect crystals and defeat crystal people. It&#x27;s out on December 6th and you&#x27;ll find the first trailer below.

                              <span>Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.
But removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.

Ahead of that though, we’ve been introduced to another member of the game’s expanding cast of the still-living. New undead slayer Amy has been given her own teaser trailer, which you can watch here.

                              <span>A conversation in the RPS Treehouse the other day reminded me that there is only one game I have ever completed for the first time and then finished again, all within the span of a week. That game was The Walking Dead: The Final Season.
Having played all three previous seasons of Telltale&#x27;s choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it&#x27;s no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine&#x27;s story by The Final Season. I&#x27;m not a big kid person, typically, but you&#x27;d have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn&#x27;t you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she&#x27;s grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.

                              <span>University sim Two Point Campus is shipping its students off out into the actual universe when the game’s first big expansion arrives on PC on December 6th. Space Academy adds new interplanetary campus locations, including a cheesy asteroid, along with more student archetypes, courses, and classrooms for your college. You can catch a glimpse of what’s ahead in the new term by watching the video below.

                              <span>Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we&#x27;re a few years clear of Slay The Spire&#x27;s chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I&#x27;ve sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence &#x27;em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we&#x27;ll see the launch of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It&#x27;s a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I&#x27;m saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. 
Made by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It&#x27;s a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That&#x27;s because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you&#x27;ll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, it&#x27;s both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.

                              <span>Having returned to World Of Warcraft after many, many years away from Azeroth in our new Inventory Space video series, I&#x27;m taken aback by how disjointed the new player experience has become. Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they&#x27;ve made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big? Or put another way: am I unable to grasp just how vast its become?

                              <span>Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven’s deliberately scene-chewing take on Robert Heinlein’s dubious classic of military sci-fi, has been adapted for PC a fair bit. Games based on the interstellar action of the movie tend to end up veering towards the strategy genre though, such as the recent Terran Command. Well, Offworld Industries have loaded up a dropship with Starship Troopers: Extermination and plonked the licence right where it belongs on Planet Co-op FPS. It’s targeting a 2023 release, and probably the head carapace of a very confused giant alien insectoid, too. You can watch a short teaser for the game below.

                              <span>Microsoft might consider offering Sony a 10-year licensing deal for Call Of Duty to persuade European Union regulators to approve their Activision Blizzard acquisition. Reuters report that sources familiar with the deal claim an offer could come ahead of the European Commission’s January deadline for their statement of objection, a formal list of the body’s concerns about how the $68.7 billion (£57 billion) buyout deal might affect competition within the games industry. If Microsoft show willingness to offer concessions and ease the EU regulator’s competition concerns, that could potentially speed up the regulator’s decision-making process.

                              <span>Nintendo and animation studio Illumination shared the latest trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie today. Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was on hand to introduce the new trailer; Anya Taylor-Joy (who is playing Princess Peach) and Seth Rogan (who voices Donkey Kong) also shared selfie videos of themselves sharing their contractually obligated excitement about participating in the film.
The trailer showed more of the Mushroom Kingdom and primarily focused on Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. We also heard more from Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario, Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi, and Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser (who explicitly refers to Mario as being a human). The trailer shows Mario training, fighting Donkey Kong, driving a kart on a rainbow road, traveling with Peach, and there was also one quick moment where we saw the human world.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7, 2023. You can see our live reaction to the trailer below.</span>

This news comes by way of a new Overwatch 2 Season 2 trailer released today, which you can view below, alongside a new blog post from Blizzard. In the trailer, we get a look at the new tank hero joining the roster, Ramattra, as well as the new Shambali escort map going into the game&#x27;s regular rotation alongside returning favorites. Plus, we see Junker Queen&#x27;s new Mythic skin available in the new battle pass as well as a look at some of the holiday skins from upcoming holiday events.

                              <span>Before the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal revealed that following the game&#x27;s launch, four-player co-op, a heavily requested feature by fans, would be added in the form of a new mode called Heroic Assault. That mode, as well as a new two-player mode called Showdown, are both live now in Gotham Knights thanks to a new update. 
The base campaign of Gotham Knights allows for two-player co-op play, but getting all four of the knights together wasn&#x27;t possible. That&#x27;s still the case while playing through the game&#x27;s story, but the new online cooperative Heroic Assault mode, which tasks players with defeating enemies and completing challenges across 30 floors, supports four-player play.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red has revealed that its upcoming remake of The Witcher will be open-world. 
This news comes by way of a quarterly financial call held yesterday by the company in which CDPR briefly touched on this remake being handled by developer Fool&#x27;s Theory, as reported by VG247.  While not much was revealed, CDPR did reveal in the slide pictured below that Codename: Canis Majoris, which we now know to be The Witcher Remake, will be a &quot;story-driven, single player open-world RPG&quot; and a &quot;modern reimagining of 2007&#x27;s The Witcher.&quot;
This might come as a surprise because that 2007 game wasn&#x27;t open-world and instead took players through small hub-like levels in the city of Vizima. 
Unfortunatley, this slide is essentially all that was revealed in regards to The Witcher Remake. It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to &quot;please be patient&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be a while until we can share more details&quot; when the company announced this game last month. 
The Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename &quot;Hadar.&quot;

The &#x27;dynamic&#x27; injunction requires Internet providers to block access to unauthorized IPTV streams during the current NHL season. It&#x27;s the second order of its kind and, if effective, it won&#x27;t be the last either.

In brief emails to customers, Uploaded owner Cyando blames &quot;the situation&quot; for the site&#x27;s closure, but provides no other details. It seems likely that Uploaded is being pushed off a cliff before a quagmire of legal action suffocates it to death.

No one could. But the infobahn baron played a role in my tale&#x27;s thrilling conclusion, and so my publishers are unthrilled by recent developments. They&#x27;re holding the novel&#x27;s launch back so I can address &#x27;the Musk issue&#x27; with a sequel released simultaneously. So as a Cyber Monday treat, allow me to top up your thrill levels with excerpts from book two: Original Content, a Non-Fungible Future drop.

                              <span>Yoshiro Kimura and his studio, Onion Games, are known for being off-beat. They make games that go in hard on their own strange internal worlds, wrapping up a particular sense of passion and energy in earnestly oddball humour. Undertale makes for a handy comparison - which makes sense, because many of the team worked on Moon, one of the games that inspired it. 
I&#x27;m telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year.

                              <span>I&#x27;m extremely excited to announce Inventory Space! A new video series in which Liam and I spend our precious free time with massive live-service games to see how much they demand from our schedules. Are we able to truly experience everything these games have to offer without sacrificing the bits of our daily routines that keep us from withering away at our monitors? How many hours do you really need to invest in order to fully experience a game? And is it even worth it, in the end? 
Inventory Space will – hopefully – give you a better idea of whether mammoth games will slot into your life neatly, or not at all.

                              <span>Oi, you. Are you looking for a good time? A cosy time? I&#x27;ve got *opens trenchcoat* Townscaper, a no-stress little building toy. You&#x27;ll see colours for days, mate. Buildings popping up in all manners of shapes and sizes, no objectives or nuffin&#x27;. Ahh, you want the new stuff, eh? Well lucky you, I just got some Gourdlets in.
Gourdlets is another city-building sandbox with no purpose beyond placing stuff you think looks nice, only this time little blob dudes will come visit and interact with what you&#x27;ve built. The first taste is free, by which I mean there&#x27;s an Itch demo you can tinker with while we wait for the Steam version.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy road, but the new generation of plucky Settlers are at last approaching their destination. Now known as The Settlers: New Allies, Ubisoft&#x27;s Settlers reboot is due to come out on February 23rd.
Katharine quite liked what she played of the town-building RTS last January, but the devs decided feedback from their closed beta meant the game warranted more time in the oven, and thus a third major postponement since the game&#x27;s original 2018 announcement. Come watch the trailer below to see what&#x27;s new.

                              <span>Gaming monitors are great, but if we&#x27;re being realistic, they can very easily become one of the priciest building blocks in your entire PC gaming setup. If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

                              <span>After more than six years of making games together, indie development team Sokpop Collective are just about to reach their 100th release in December. Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.

                              <span>Unlike with most flavours of PC hardware, the list of good Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals is noticeably smaller than the catalogue of quality, discounted notebooks that Black Friday brought. That’s partly stock running out, and partly retailers just being less willing to extend these sales over the weekend. Killjoys. Still, we’re not out of luck yet, nor out of laptops – as you’ll see below, there’s still a variety of deals to choose from, especially in the UK.

                              <span>Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That&#x27;s 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?
The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn&#x27;t after a nostalgia kick.

                              <span>Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you&#x27;re mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what&#x27;s a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It&#x27;s not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

                              <span>Synced (formerly Synced: Off Planet) is heading into open beta on December 10th, and has quite a few hyphenated terms applied to it. This sci-fi game is both squad-based and match-based, a roguelite hero-shooter, and Tencent&#x27;s publishing division Level Infinite even go as far as describing it as a rogue-looter, of all things. Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian. Come and see what to expect when the beta begins in an exclusive gameplay trailer below.

Thought it’s more than a handful, really – multiple big, stretching fistfuls of quality PC storage deals are still running, and should continue to do so until the clock strikes midnight. Or until they run out of stock. Hopefully the former.

The group is well-known for its steady and prolific release schedule, but last Friday things went quiet. EVO&#x27;s mysterious absence fuels rumors of a potential bust, but nothing is confirmed thus far.

Offworld is making Extermination in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and in the game, players will engage in squad-based FPS combat to exterminate the arachnid threat fans of the 1997 film will know really well. Those squads will need to work together in order to complete objectives, acquire resources necessary to continue the fight, build and defend a base of operations, and ultimately, escape to the one extraction point as a team.

                              <span>Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they&#x27;ve also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 &quot;fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island,&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer&#x27;s Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU&#x27;s future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC&#x27;s entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are &quot;planning to give more DC characters TV shows that&#x27;ll add to the story for the DCEU,&quot; Gunn responded, &quot;Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It&#x27;s an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios&#x27; MCU. However, MCU plans don&#x27;t include video games because Marvel&#x27;s video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel&#x27;s Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it&#x27;s important that each studios&#x27; Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it&#x27;s the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer&#x27;s Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that. 
Do you like the idea of games connecting to the DCU or do you prefer Marvel&#x27;s approach to video games? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

Last week a California court found Arvin De La Santos liable for $150,000 in copyright infringement damages, a &quot;landmark&quot; win according to Triller. The details of the case provide a little more nuance.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

                              <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN has revealed that one of its reports played a role in the criminal investigation of Z-Library. The report in question reportedly identified a number of suspects. Whether the resulting law enforcement actions will be effective in the long run is unknown but BREIN plans to seek a site-blocking order if the shadow library reappears on the surface web.

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…</span>

The nine realms are dark and dangerous, but through all of that shines a beam of unexpected light, and I am not talking about Brok, the dwarf who seems incapable of finishing a sentence without including some kind of vulgarity before meeting the period at the end. I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…</span>

                              <span>In each issue, Game Informer prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We&#x27;d like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.
You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on December 20.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What&#x27;s the best gaming-related gift you&#x27;ve ever received?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...</span>

It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                              <span>Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn&#x27;t faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game&#x27;s success to share how Sonic&#x27;s second outing became one of Sega&#x27;s driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

                              <span>The propellers spin down, and I step off the puddle-jumper plane onto the tarmac of the tiniest airport I’ve ever visited. Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...</span>

                              <span>In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard jump into Outer Terror, an upcoming pulp action-horror game coming to PC sometime soon. 
The two discuss the game&#x27;s visual style, how it plays, its similarities to Vampire Survivors, and everything else going on in this exclusive preview. This demo build features a small snippet of one of the game&#x27;s five volumes and our gameplay showcases how the on-screen action works, the horrors from beyond, and how quests work in Outer Terror. 
Check out Outer Terror for yourself below in this installment of New Gameplay Today: 


As you can see, Outer Terror is shaping up to be a great time, perfect for those moments where you&#x27;ve got 10 or 15 minutes to blitz through hordes of the undead, monsters from beyond, and more. For more about Outer Terror and what to expect from the game, check out our coverage of the game from last month. 
Outer Terror hits PC via Steam and the VoxPop Games Store (with exclusive content on that storefront, too), but a release date has not yet been revealed.

It’ll be a night of celebrities, game announcements, and an infamous afterparty full of alcohol, confetti, and blaring music. It’ll take over Twitter, and leave more than a few people nursing headaches the following day.
But today, instead of focusing on his big night, studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama is sitting in a conference room talking about why he loves Neon Genesis Evangelion. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo&#x27;s history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.</span>

                              <span>Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …</span>

                              <span>Over the years, what defines a game as the “action” category has gotten more ambiguous than ever, as many games now include aspects of multiple core genres. However, one thing remains certain – games in this category give the player a polished, exciting experience. So, what is this list all about? This isn’t a Top 10 Action Games of All Time list or a Top 10 Action Games of a Generation list. Instead, we’re tackling this one from the angle of what’s important, what’s incredible, and what’s fantastic right now. As in today. This week. This month.

                              <span>Each time a new Street Fighter entry rolls around, we get introduced to a new cast of characters and reintroduced to some of our favorite series mainstays. Street Fighter 6 is no different in this regard. Amid the new additions like Kimberly, Jamie, and Luke, longtime players can find comfort in the presence of fighters like Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, and Ken appearing as well. However, even those returning fighters have some changes to their looks, outfits, and personalities for this sixth mainline entry.
During our trip to Osaka, Japan, where we visited Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, we sat down with Street Fighter 6 art director Kaname Fujioka to learn more about his time at Capcom. &quot;The biggest inspiration for me wanting to join Capcom and work on fighting games was Street Fighter II,&quot; he says. &quot;I w…</span>
