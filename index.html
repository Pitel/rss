Konami and Apple Arcade teamed up for another game, and this one&#x27;s got a quirky musical twist. Amazing Bomberman flips the script on the series&#x27; familiar explosion-dodging action with score chasing and battlegrounds that change to suit the song.

A new stability patch is live for TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, across all platforms. The update is set to address bugs and make game stability improvements for all the turtle-powered action.
According to publisher Dotemu, the patch addresses some &quot;tedious bugs&quot; and adds a number of improvements, both for gameplay and online features.
&quot;Tribute Games to the rescue!&quot; Dotemu declared on Twitter, shouting out the TMNT developer alongside the announcement of the update.

The patch notes are fairly lengthy. In it, Tribute Games and Dotemu detail a number of fixes, some big and some small.
For example, under the Gameplay Bug Fixes, there&#x27;s a fix for enemies sometimes getting frozen after a Fling Slam. That&#x27;s a bit jarring to the acti…</span>

We&#x27;ve seen a lot of video game adaptations over the past few years, but none of them have been quite as successful as Riot&#x27;s League of Legends TV show Arcane. The Netflix series was praised by critics and fans alike, has already won multiple awards ahead of the 2022 Emmys, and Season 2 of the show has been confirmed for quite a while.

                              <span>Somewhat confusingly, it&#x27;s a Neo Geo Pocket Color version of two games in one bundle
Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters is now available on Switch is not something I ever thought I would be able to say out loud. But given the massive success of the platform, I guess it shouldn&#x27;t surprise me.
Thanks to a tip from a reader, it&#x27;s come to our attention that the game is now available on the eShop for $7.99, with no fanfare and no official announcement from the publisher or Nintendo&#x27;s weekly eShop drop. This edition is actually an &quot;arrangement&quot; of two games (Power Battle and the sequel, Power Fighters), in the form of a Neo Geo Pocket port. The gist of the &quot;Power&quot; spinoffs: you take Mega Man, Proto Man, and Bass (with Duo as a fourth option in the sequel) against a gauntlet of boss enemies (robot master…</span>

                              <span>Even more Resident Evil joins the ranks of Dead by Daylight
Three classic Resident Evil characters, including one of the series&#x27; most iconic villains, are joining in on the asymmetrical horror. Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker are all coming to Dead by Daylight soon.
Revealed today as part of Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s look-ahead showcase, the three characters arrive as part of an update called Resident Evil: Project W. It&#x27;s probably safe to say the &quot;W&quot; stands for Wesker.
While Albert Wesker, the Mastermind, will take on the role of Killer, two heroines are joining the roster to help the others out. Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong will be Survivors, part of the crew trying to evade the killer and make it out alive.

                              <span>FIFA&#x27;s final days keep EA in the premiership
It&#x27;s the turn of long-time developer/publisher Electronic Arts to share its results from the most recent quarter of the 2023 financial year. And while many publishers are showing a slump in overall revenue, EA seems to be relatively healthy, powered by its ongoing dominance over the sporting game industry.
Overall revenue for EA is up 14% year-on-year, which translates to a meaty $1.77 billion USD. Net income is also up — offering a huge 52% rise which equates to $311 million. It will probably come as zero surprise that the FIFA franchise is still one of the aces in EA&#x27;s portfolio, with FIFA Mobile and microtransactions service FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow in both revenue and users. FUT has, notably, seen its user base rise by 40% in the past 12 months.
It also seems that EA&#x27;s purchase of Codemasters was a very savvy decision, as the UK developer&#x27;s F1 22 has actually outperformed on the publisher&#x27;s expectations. Codemasters was, of course, purchased by EA for $1.2 billion back in early 2021. EA was hoping that the acquisition would give it a dominant stake in the racing game market, and it seems that the British studio is already delivering on those hopes.
This year&#x27;s FIFA entry, FIFA 23, will be the final football sim released with the official FIFA branding. While EA has a huge task ahead in rebranding one of the biggest and most profitable gaming franchises on the planet, the community knows where its dedication lies, and it seems hugely unlikely that the loss of the FIFA brand will harm EA&#x27;s bottom line in the bigger picture.

                              <span>A Warcraft mobile project has apparently been shuttered
Activision Blizzard and NetEase have collaborated on several projects, including the recent Diablo Immortal. But a new report claims a potential Warcraft mobile game has fallen through.
Bloomberg reports that a World of Warcraft mobile game has been shuttered. The project was in development for three years, but according to Bloomberg&#x27;s sources, the two companies disagreed over financial terms and ultimately called it off.
The team of over 100 developers has allegedly been disbanded. Some were reportedly offered internal transfers. A spokesperson for NetEase declined to comment on the matter to Bloomberg. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson gave no comment.

Warcraft in the palm of your hand
The canceled project, code-named as Neptune according to Bloomberg, was a massively multiplayer online RPG set in the World of Warcraft universe. The report says it wouldn&#x27;t be a direct one-to-one of the mega-hit WoW, but a spinoff set during a different time period.
NetEase and Blizzard have collaborated on several major projects, so the report comes as a bit of a surprise. Alongside Diablo Immortal, which has received some frustrated reactions from fans, NetEase also publishes World of Warcraft and other Blizzard franchises in China.
Though fans haven&#x27;t been wild about the microtransactions, Diablo Immortal has continued to see growth, and World of Warcraft is building up to the launch of its next expansion Dragonflight.
Whether this is a stumbling block or not, it looks like mobile Warcraft plans are on hold for now. Or at least the reportedly MMO-based ones, that is. There is the upcoming Warcraft Arclight Rumble, a game similar to Clash of Clans that&#x27;s coming to Android and iOS.

                              <span>111.08 million units, to be exact
Thanks to a new financial briefing in August of 2023, Nintendo has updated their sales figures, and it&#x27;s looking good as the Nintendo Switch 111 million unit mark has just been cleared.
The numbers have been fully updated on Nintendo&#x27;s investor relations page, showcasing a staggering 111.08 million units sold for Switch hardware (combined across all models), as well as 863.59 million units of software. The Switch already surpassed the Wii in total hardware sales (which is at 101.63 million), and it&#x27;s about to beat it software-wise, too. (The Wii has 921.85 million units sold in that arena.) The record is still held by the Nintendo DS, once king of the roost, with 948 million units of software sold across its lifetime.
What is the best-selling console/game system of all time as of 2022?
Unpacking it all, the Nintendo is solidifying its place as the fifth best-selling system of all time, behind the PS2, Nintendo DS, Game Boy/Game Boy Color, and PS4, respectively. The Switch is well on its way to crack the PS4&#x27;s 117.2 million mark, then it&#x27;s coming for the Game Boy next (which has 118.69 million units sold). From there it&#x27;s more of an uphill climb to crack into the top two. The Nintendo DS has a figure of roughly 154.02 million lifetime sales, with the PS2 sitting at an estimated 155 million.
We&#x27;ll get there when we get there — if we get there. For now, Nintendo is still riding high with the Switch.

Mediatonic has revealed the newest collaboration for its madcap battle royale title Fall Guys — SNK superstars Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui from hit slugfest The King of Fighters have had their finely tuned anatomies squished into bizarre bean form, and are coming to the free-to-play title this week.
Mai and Terry, who first found fame in the legendary one-on-one fighter Fatal Fury, have been faithfully recreated in their iconic wardrobe. Mai is rocking her notoriously revealing kunoichi gear while Terry is keeping the spirit of &#x27;91 alive in his denim jeans, sleeveless jacket, and famous baseball cap. I mean, they&#x27;re certainly faithful recreations, but Good Lord they both look pretty durn weird.

In addition to the new skins, Fall Guys fans will be available to purchase a &quot;Shiranui Style of Ninja Arts&quot; nameplate and Terry&#x27;s famous &quot;C&#x27;mon&quot; C&#x27;mon!&quot; taunt/emote. The King of Fighters content will be made available in-store between August 4-8 on all platforms, so be sure to move fast if you wanna be Buster Wolfing your way through hundreds of other beans — all embarking on the quest for the coveted crown. Expecting a lot of tumbling, rolling, falling, and slapstick buffoonery en route.
Fall Guys — which recently went free-to-play on all platforms — is currently seeing something of a resurgence in popularity, hitting an impressive milestone of 50 million players just last month. You can check out the simple but surprisingly moreish multiplayer title for yourself right now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>We get a look at more farming, socializing, and one of the town&#x27;s residents
Square Enix is sharing some more info about its slice-of-life farming RPG Harvestella today. A new blog highlights one of the locals, some of the in-game activities, and the very hometown itself of Nemea.
Nemea is the town in which Harvestella takes place, and life there is governed by five seasons. While we&#x27;re familiar with autumn, winter, spring, and summer, Nemea&#x27;s fifth season is a bit more dangerous. Quietus arrives between each season, and it carries a deadly dust that keeps residents indoors and destroys crops.
So clearly, figuring out what&#x27;s up with Quietus is a sizable preoccupation for the player. But in today&#x27;s Square Enix blog, we get a bunch of looks at Nemea, a gorgeous town with flowers constantly in…</span>

                              <span>It sold over four million since March 25
Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the fastest-selling Kirby ever, according to a new passage from Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial report (page 13).
Here&#x27;s Nintendo&#x27;s breakdown:
&quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released on March 25, saw global cumulative sellthrough in its first 15 weeks of over 4 million units. This marks the highest sellthrough of any entry to date in the Kirby series, which celebrated its 30th anniversary in April of this year.&quot;

Despite being the fastest-selling Kirby ever, as of right now, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land — the 1992 Game Boy original — is the only title in the series that is towering over it. Dream Land has held the title since the series started, and has peddled over five million copies to date according to Nintendo. Having beaten it at least 100 times on car rides for over a decade (the &quot;Extra Game&quot; playthrough addition was genius), this checks out! It&#x27;s crazy to think that all those years ago there was a Kirby game where Satoru Iwata served as a programmer, and Smash boss Masahiro Sakurai directed it.
How does this new figure relate to the overall big picture of Nintendo software? Well, Forgotten Land is doing pretty great overall! It has a long road ahead to crack into the top 10 all-time Switch list, and puts things into perspective where Kirby is, franchise-wise. The same thing goes for Metroid! These are big-time properties, but the games are generally smaller successes.
Thankfully, Nintendo isn&#x27;t pulling a Square Enix and is still putting Kirby games out. These numbers are definitely enough to keep things moving on this series, and we even have a spinoff coming in the next few months. Although a lot of franchises have peaks and valleys of popularity and are occasionally shelved, you really can&#x27;t keep Kirby down.

An exciting update for fans of the excellent rhythm-action series Crypt of the NecroDancer: developer Brace Yourself Games has announced that it has some new &quot;super-secret&quot; news pertaining to the beat-heavy dungeon crawler — news it will share with us all as soon as tomorrow, August 4.
&quot;Brace yourselves, everyone,&quot; teased the indie outfit on Twitter, &quot;because we&#x27;ve got some super-secret NecroDancer-related news comin&#x27; at you this Thursday, August 4th.&quot;
https://twitter.com/NecroDancerGame/status/1554190959117602816?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;yDjdwf4TYKrSqnLkT2cTkw
Released back in 2015, Crypt of the NecroDancer takes the classic fantasy adventure of yesteryear and marries it with intense rhythm-action gameplay and a simply delicious electro-score. Players guide a young warrior maiden as she picks her way through an array of monster-filled dungeons, moving and fighting to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack.
An incredibly infectious and compelling adventure, NecroDancer has only grown in popularity over the ensuing years, reaching the dizzy heights of a Nintendo collaboration for the acclaimed Legend of Zelda spin-off Cadence of Hyrule. As for this new venture... It could be another franchise collaboration, it could be a brand new DLC expansion, or we could even see the reveal of a new sequel or spin-off title. For now, we&#x27;ll just have to be patient, as the truth will be out soon enough.
The announcement will go live on the official Brace Yourself Games YouTube channel tomorrow at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. We&#x27;ll be sure to bring all of the dancefloor-clearing news right here on Destructoid. Crypt of the NecroDancer is available right now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

                              <span>&quot;I haven&#x27;t nailed down exactly to what degree the two will be connected&quot; says creator
Stardew Valley creator Eric ConcernedApe Barone is at it again, blowing up the internet with a single screenshot of Haunted Chocolatier. And some tweets! This week, they mused on how Haunted Chocolatier lore could be connected to their prior project.
After sharing a single screenshot from Haunted Chocolatier, Barone noted some hours later that &quot;someone pointed out the perspective looks kinda weird around the passageway, and on the drop down spots.&quot; Agreeing, they shored up the area and shared a live screen of the improvement. They clarified that they use Paint [dot] net as a tool for pixel art, and changing objects is akin to &quot;re-drawing stuff,&quot; which is &quot;time consuming.&quot; There&#x27;s &quot;no engine,&quot; as it&#x27;s &quot;all from scratch again,&quot; though they are using Monogame framework instead of XNA.
From there, Barone continues to do a Q&amp;A session of sorts on Twitter, responding to a fan that they &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; if the game will come to mobile, before tweeting &quot;probably not, to be honest&quot; (likely fueled by their experience with Stardew on mobile). When asked if the character design of what appears to be the main character is final, Barone replied: &quot;Nothing is final,&quot; at the moment and they are &quot;in the middle of everything.&quot; They re-iterate that &quot;it&#x27;s not a farming game,&quot; though there might be &quot;some plant cultivation.&quot;
This, however, is perhaps the most interesting part: &quot;It&#x27;s gonna be its own separate game with a self-contained identity... it&#x27;s not a &#x27;Stardew [Valley] 2.&#x27; But there might be some shared lore, I haven&#x27;t nailed down exactly to what degree the two will be connected.&quot; The secrets of the Haunted Chocolatier lore grow stronger every update! Having the game be completely unique with some hat tips for fans to enjoy is probably for the best.

                              <span>Take a look at the new Paldea region for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
Today, we got a new look at Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the next mainline entries in the series. Alongside a deeper dive into the people, places, and goals set out for prospective Pokemon Trainers, we also now have a full map of the Paldea region.
Paldea is the name of the new region for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, home to a variety of little monsters to discover. While we&#x27;ve had hints about the new region before, today we got a top-down view of the whole landmass.
Across the entire region we can see lakes, deserts, mountains, and more. A port town resides on the right-hand side, while a large city sits in the center. Also, there&#x27;s one big, cloudy region at the center.

It certainly seems like we won&#x27;t be wanting for variety. There&#x27;s a good mix of all kinds of different biomes here, so it should be easy enough to geo-locate some Pokemon of differing types.
Exploring the open world of Paldea
What&#x27;s also different about this Pokemon entry and region is that Scarlet and Violet are open-world games. As confirmed in today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents, the new Pokemon games will allow players to tackle the three different story threads at their own pace.
So if you wind up catching some strong Fire Pokemon and feel bold, you can head right on over to the Ice Gym and challenge the newly revealed Gym Leader, Grusha.

Or maybe you&#x27;d rather go check out that aforementioned port town, or head right to the big city. It&#x27;s all connected and available, and with the power of your mighty motorcycle Legendary Pokemon mount, the Paldea region of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is yours to explore.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will launch for the Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

We haven&#x27;t heard much in terms of the release date of Metroid Prime 4, or any info at all really, but Nintendo did a least mention it in their latest financial briefing.
They mentioned quite a few games, actually. Going forward, here is what their first-party major games slate looks like as of August 3, 2022:
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet — Summer 2022
Splatoon 3 — 9/9/2022
Bayonetta 3 — 10/28/22
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet — 11/18/22
Breath of the Wild 2 — Spring 2023
Metroid Prime 4 — TBA
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp — TBA
Out of all of these, Nintendo also chose to specifically highlight these to investors: Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass: Wave 2, Splatoon 3, and Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet. All of those are &quot;near future&quot; type products set to release by the end of September. Curiously, though Dream Buffet still just has a &quot;summer&quot; date, they list it under the &quot;by the end of September&quot; category in the brief, hinting at a release window (summer in all likelihood confirmed that anyway, but this seemingly is not going to get hit with a delay as of yet). The company also reminded everyone that a new Switch OLED model was coming on August 26 in honor of Splatoon 3. Metroid Prime 4 is still sadly TBA, as is Advance Wars.
DLC seems to be the plan for long-term growth, as Nintendo pointed out that &quot;sales were also steady for add-on content, including Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Happy Home Paradise&quot; in that same brief, and many of the above games have some form of DLC or season pass content already announced; or likely in the works.

Yukes, THQ, and All Elite Wrestling (AEW) have &quot;officially announced&quot; the company&#x27;s first-ever foray into the video game world, AEW: Fight Forever. While the existence of the game was no secret, the teams put out today&#x27;s statement after multiple retailers — including Amazon UK and Xtralife — revealed several features, modes, roster members, and the cover art to the debutante wrestling title.

According to the retailer listings and the official statement, the digital ring-rocker will feature newly optimized tag mechanics, support for online Vs/co-op multiplayer, as well as a huge arsenal of over 40 weapons, daily in-game challenges, and much more. A selection of featured match types includes standard one-on-one, multi-wrestler, and tag-…</span>

                              <span>Memories are all we have
The Annapurna Interactive Showcase from last week might have only been 25 minutes, but it was packed with all kinds of new trailers and info on upcoming releases. One game I hadn&#x27;t seen before was Hindsight, and as a lover of narrative games (especially those published by Annapurna), I knew it was one I wanted to try out.
In Hindsight, you play as a woman named Mary, traveling through her memories as she recounts her relationship with her parents, her mother in particular. The two have a somewhat strained relationship, wherein Mary&#x27;s mother is controlling, which is often at odds with Mary acting like a normal kid.

                              <span>It&#x27;s running through February 28, 2023
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet aren&#x27;t scheduled to arrive until November 18, but a special Pikachu distribution event is already a go.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mZf-vIpVDLo
Sneakily announced at the end of a trailer that debuted during the August 2022 Pokemon Presents stream, the event kicks off roughly around when the game starts. It&#x27;s for a &quot;special Pikachu,&quot; and will be in line with the new &quot;Terastallizing&quot; form mechanic that&#x27;s been introduced in this generation.
It knows the move &quot;Fly,&quot; and is also a flying Tera type. The event will run from the game&#x27;s launch (when you can access it), through February 28, 2023. It&#x27;s similar to other early access events from mainline games: the idea is to incentivize players into picking up the game early. That&#x27;s pretty much all we have in terms of details at the moment.
As for the technical fine print, The Pokemon Company notes that you can acquire this through normal mystery gift means — which also confirms the feature for Scarlet and Violet (as if there was any chance it wasn&#x27;t coming back). You do not need a paid Switch Online membership to access the special Pikachu distribution event, and it takes &quot;one to one and a half hours&quot; to work up to the point where the mystery gift feature is enabled.

Thanks to a new Pokemon Presents stream, we have new info on some Pokemon Scarlet and Violet features.
Nothing in terms of major bombshells dropped, but there&#x27;s plenty of stuff for fans to unpack. The narrative includes &quot;attending an academy as a student,&quot; with the core objective of embarking upon a treasure hunt with &quot;three grand stories.&quot; Of course, one of them is a series of classic gym battles.
Legendaries can be used as mounts, with &quot;sprinting or drive mode&quot; for land travel, &quot;swimming and aquatic&quot; for sea, and &quot;gliding build/glide mode&quot; in the air. You&#x27;re encouraged to &quot;ride your Legendary Pokemon to traverse the expansive Paldea region and explore every nook and cranny together.&quot;

The Pokemon Company showed off the August 2022 Pokemon Presents stream today, and gave us a few updates on events, spinoffs, and core titles.
Here&#x27;s what you need to know!

August 2022 Pokemon Presents big news:
The Pokemon World Championships will be held on August 18-21 in London in person with &quot;thousands of players from around the world&quot; competing (with card game, video game, and Pokken Tournament elements). Pokemon Go and Pokemon Unite are part of the festivities too.
Pokemon Go is running an event in Sapporo, Japan, featuring Ultra Beasts, and the Pokemon Go Fest finale is on August 27. Daily adventure incense has been added, once a day, for 15 minutes (it can attract legendary Pokemon).
The team reiterated the Pokemon Unite first anniversary eve…</span>

D3Publisher, known for giving us titles like Onee Chanbara Origins and the Earth Defense Force series, has pulled back the curtain on its latest work for hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash fans to get excited about. After dropping a short teaser for the game late last week, the publisher released the debut trailer for Samurai Maiden this morning. From developer Shade Inc., perhaps best known for Gun Gun Pixies and the Bullet Girls franchise, the action title puts players in control of Tsumugi Tamaori who, after falling asleep following her history lesson, wakes up in Sengoku-era Japan. It&#x27;s there she meets Nobunaga Oda, who gifts her a sacred sword she&#x27;ll need to defeat undead mobs that have taken over the land. Tamaori may be out of place in the past but she won&#x27;t be alone. Along the way, she&#x27;ll hook up with three ninjas from the Honnoji Temple to aid her in her mission.
The three teammates will come in handy when players want to unleash attacks using the Gokage System – which combines her sword skills with their ninjutsu specialties – to help fight through the hellish hordes. As the girls adventure together and grow their bonds, they&#x27;ll also gain access to special abilities that can be unlocked when they share a kiss, something that&#x27;s hinted at the end of the trailer below. Before you get too excited, keep in mind this game is rated &quot;T&quot; for Teen.

The trailer makes a good enough first impression on me that I&#x27;ll have to keep tabs on Samurai Maiden as we draw closer to its release date. I know Shade Inc. might not have the most polished resume, but it doesn&#x27;t take that much for a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash to keep me entertained.
Samurai Maiden will launch this winter for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam.

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are the focus
An August 3 Pokemon stream is confirmed! The Pokemon Company tweeted out the news this morning, noting that there will be a 9AM ET presentation on that day.
The tweet says that there will be &quot;updates on Pokemon apps and video games, including Scarlet and Violet,&quot; so at least one project is called out by name. The rest is up in the air, but given the format for the past year or so, we kind of know what some of the usual suspects are.
In case you forgot what they look like, we have a recap of a previous presentation here. They can provide numerous details for mobile/spinoff projects, with a big finish that focuses on &quot;mainline games.&quot; There&#x27;s a 99.9% chance we&#x27;ll get confirmation of more creatures (and a look at some returning Pokemon), as well as some quick looks at several mechanical changes/additions to the formula with the new generational leap.
Here is what we could see touched upon in the August 3 Pokemon stream:
Pokemon Unite anniversary event updates

                              <span>New Blood announces two dates at once
While the date for one game is moving back a few weeks, another is sliding in to take its place. Publisher New Blood confirms that Gloomwood will have its Early Access launch pushed back, with Ultrakill Act 2 taking its spot.
While the immersive sim Gloomwood was set to hit Early Access on August 16, the game will need some extra time to come together. A few issues have cropped up over the last few months, according to a statement, as well as some developers coming down with COVID-19. The team made the decision to push its release date back by three weeks, to September 6.
https://twitter.com/NewBlood/status/1554532639259783168
It&#x27;s a little extra time for those who have been patiently waiting, but from the ash arrives a new launch to take its place. New Blood confirms that the second act of Ultrakill, a retro-inspired FPS inspired by the heydays of the &#x27;90s, arrives on August 16.
Ultrakill, which is in Early Access right now, has an overwhelmingly positive reception so far on Steam&#x27;s user reviews. And while it&#x27;s only $20 at the moment, the price will be going up on August 16 with the launch of Act 2.

Hot swap launches
While Gloomwood fans may be waiting a bit longer for their particular brand of immersive sim, there is at least more Ultrakill on the way to tide them over. And really, both seem to scratch an itch of retro-inspired first-person PC gaming. Just each in their own little way; Gloomwood in sneaking and surviving, and Ultrakill in over-the-top shooter fashion.
It&#x27;s a fun swap that New Blood has done, and I&#x27;m down with it. Plus, Gloomwood also has a pre-alpha demo available on its Steam page right now, if you&#x27;re quite eager to try it out. Ultrakill also has a demo, and Act 1 is currently in Early Access.

                              <span>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

                              <span>Throughout 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII&#x27;s Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren&#x27;t able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you&#x27;ve missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game&#x27;s launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million
Pokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million
Super Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million
Super Mario Party: 18.06 million
Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million
Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million
Ring Fit Adventure: 14.54 million
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well. Nintendo Switch Sports sold 4.84 million units, Mario Strikers: Battle League sold 1.91 million, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land sold 1.88 million units, making it the second-best selling Kirby game of all-time.

After that, feast your eyes upon all the new Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet revealed in today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents showcase.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game&#x27;s entitlement on Google Stadia but another&#x27;s rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month&#x27;s offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company&#x27;s new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.</span>

During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents livestream, The Pokémon Company revealed a ton of new details surrounding the first fully open-world RPGs in the Pokémon franchise, Scarlet and Violet. During the extended trailer and subsequent deep dive, we received new info about the region in which the games take place, how multiplayer works, some of the Pokémon players will encounter during their adventure, and the new Terastal phenomenon that allows Pokémon to change.
In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players embark on an adventure in the Paldea region, a massive area full of lakes, mountains, wastelands, and more. Outside of its natural lands…</span>

The Pokémon Company describes the Paldea region as &quot;a land of vast open spaces dotted with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, and mountain ranges.&quot; Players can expect everything from small farming villages to bustling port towns.
You can see the full trailer from today&#x27;s livestream below:

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling’s first triple-A wrestling title, AEW: Fight Forever, takes a few significant steps towards becoming a reality. After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW&#x27;s in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. 
First off, here’s what the box art looks like:

While hardware sales of the base Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite have surpassed 111 million units sold, sales are down nearly 23% overall. 
More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch&#x27;s sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

​NBA 2K is still in a rebuilding phase. While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year&#x27;s game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.
We still don&#x27;t have insight into any of this year&#x27;s modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan&#x27;s career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word &quot;authenticity&quot; to sum up this year&#x27;s changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:
Easier Play
More Pro for the Pro Stick
Hang on the Rim
Shooting is a Weapon
Killing Stalls with Adrenaline 
Defensive Play
Improved A.I.
Badges Sound More Confusing But Better?

Back in 1999, Pokémon Red and Blue launched at the perfect time for me; I was ten at the time of its release and had already gotten a good sense of what Pokémon was all about thanks to the anime show. Soon enough, my friends and I were completely hooked: we traded together on the playground at school, speculated about what the upcoming Gold and Silver iterations would bring to the table, and discussed the latest anime episode in absurd detail - much to the annoyance of our teachers, I&#x27;m sure.
Then something happened. After Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire launched in 2003 for the GBA, four years after the franchise first got its claws into me, I just... stop caring so much. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint why it happened at that particular moment in time, but I can at least break down my reasoning.

Square Enix is keeping its end-of-year release calendar extremely busy. Even if you discount titles like Star Ocean: The Divine Force and Valkyrie Elysium, its Switch line-up — which includes The DioField Chronicle, NieR: Automata, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion — is a force to be reckoned with.
But those are all multiplatform releases or ports — and we know we haven&#x27;t covered everything there — but there&#x27;s one game Square Enix is releasing that is a Switch console exclusive. Harvestella was revealed during Nintendo&#x27;s most recent Partner Direct, and it looks like something a bit different for the RPG developer.

To the surprise of everyone, a lesser-known Mega Man game has just shadow dropped on the Switch eShop in the US. At the time of writing, it isn&#x27;t yet available on the eShop in the EU, but we&#x27;ll be sure to update you if it crops up.
Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters is a Switch port of a Neo Geo Pocket Colour compilation, comprising of portable versions of Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters. The game launched back in 2000 but it was only available for customers in Japan.

If you played the excellent Neon White recently and were surprised to learn it was published by Annapurna Interactive, brace yourself to be completely unsurprised with this one: they don’t come much more Annapurna-y than this. Hindsight is a story that plays out through gentle interactions, with no complex objectives or skill challenges, and it’s beautifully presented and brimming with nostalgic charm.
The game presents a series of static 3D scenes from the narrator’s life, within which you can turn the camera to find interactive elements. The locations are everyday settings – rooms of a home, a restaurant, the seaside – and the protagonist is present in all of them, experiencing or reflecting on events. The interactive parts may be further apparitions of the protagonist, which you select to move the camera over to them, or even objects that glint to signal their significance.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are the newest Pokémon games on the block, and the first new mainline entry in the series since Pokémon Sword and Shield came out in November 2019. Scarlet and Violet will be out later this year — the 18th November, 2022, to be exact — and they&#x27;re both based around the Iberian Peninsula, so expect a lot of Spanish and Portuguese cultural references.
Here are all the new Pokémon we know about so far:

                              <span>And that&#x27;s just one of three main stories!
During the latest Pokémon Presents broadcast, it was reiterated that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet would be fully open world; a first for the mainline series after the franchise dipped its toes in the water with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
To hit this home, it was confirmed that players will be tasked with challenging eight gym leaders, much like previous games. What&#x27;s different this time, however, is you&#x27;re completely free to choose which gym you want to tackle first, opening up a world of possibilities for players to weave their own story within the region of Paldea. One Gym Leader has already been confirmed, too: Grusha, the leader of Glaseado Gym, an ice-type specialist.

                              <span>Welcome to Paldea.
The Pokémon Company has unveiled a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as part of its Pokémon Presents broadcast earlier today.
The trailer itself unveils the name of the brand new region you&#x27;ll be exploring: Paldea. In addition, we get a good look at some of the traversal mechanics via the Legendary Pokémon and a glimpse at the new &#x27;Treasure Hunt&#x27; narrative feature. This introduces what looks like the game&#x27;s main &#x27;hook&#x27;: a mechanic called &#x27;Terestal Phenomenon&#x27;, which basically makes your Pokémon buddies go all shiny and crystalised.

Were you thinking we were about due for some Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet information? Well, today&#x27;s your lucky day! Earlier this week, The Pokémon Company announced that a new Pokémon Presents will be taking place today, 3rd August.
Not only that, we know we&#x27;ll be getting some new info on Generation 9, the first open-world Pokémon RPGs. Other info will contain updates on the franchise&#x27;s apps and other media, so it seems likely we&#x27;ll get some more Pokémon Unite details — seeing as the game just celebrated its first birthday. and Pokémon GO is still going strong, of course, so it&#x27;s likely it&#x27;ll make a brief appearance.

It&#x27;s been a little while since we&#x27;ve heard anything about WayForward&#x27;s River City Girls 2. Revealed last year and confirmed for a summer 2022 release date, the beat &#x27;em up sequel — and spin-off to the Kunio-kun series — is looking to bring multiple improvements to the game.
However, Nintendo Everything reports (via Gematsu) that the game will now be released on 1st December in Japan. That&#x27;s a little bit outside of last year&#x27;s projected summer 2022 release window! This date was confirmed in the latest issue of Famitsu.

Who remembers Risen? This PC and Xbox 360 action RPG, developed by the German company Piranha Bytes, came out in 2009. At the time, reviewers praised the game&#x27;s visuals, gameplay, and voice acting, but the Xbox version came under a lot of criticism for being a bit of a technical mess.
Now, Gematsu has spotted that the game has been rated for a Switch port in Germany. Filed by rating board USK, the game is supposedly coming to PS4 and Xbox One too and will be published by THQ Nordic.

After becoming the most successful Kirby game in the UK ever last week, Nintendo now reports that the latest Kirby game has seen the highest sell-through of any Kirby game to date! This comes from Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial report, which was published earlier today.
That news means that Forgotten Land has been a pretty fast seller, selling over 4 million units in 15 weeks — pretty big numbers for Kirby! Sitting at 4.53 million sales, that makes this 3D game the second best-selling Kirby game ever.

Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors.

That&#x27;s incredible value, working out as just 7 cents per gigabyte, and marks a sea change in the affordability of NVMe SSDs.

Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight.

The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

YouTube). Přímo HDR streamování pak funguje jen s YouTube HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) a formátem HEVC, OBS může pro zachytávání HDR streamu využívat hardware s podporou HDR (např. EVGA XR1 Pro, Elgato 4K60 Pro Mk.2, AverMedia Live Gamer 4K). S HDR však nefungují některé filtry (Apply LUT, Chroma Key, Color Key, Image Mask/Blend, Luma Key, Sharpness). HDR také bude funkční zatím jen na Windows, na macOS a Linuxu je podpora nehotová.</span>

                              <span>Following in the footsteps of football leagues and boxing promotions, Canal+ has obtained a court order compelling local ISPs to block dozens of sites accused of illegally streaming Formula 1 events. The order is the latest in a long line of anti-piracy actions in France, where fledgling regulatory body Arcom has added hundreds of domains to the country&#x27;s official blacklist in just a few months.

Google Stadia may not have seen the massive success that the company was hoping for, but almost three years after its launch, the streaming service is still holding on. Now it seems that Google has a plan to get more players onboard, because they&#x27;ve just announced that they have over 120 game trials (and more on the way) that you can hop in and try out right now, no payment or Stadia account required. The catalog includes hit games like Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Little Nightmares, Saints Row: The Third, Terraria, Spiritfarer, and many more. Of course, this deal isn&#x27;t without its stipulations.
The trials may in fact be free, but players&#x27; time with each game is limited from anywhere between 120 minutes to 30 minutes, which is pretty insubstantial depending on which game you&#x27;re playing.
So, it&#x27;s looking like this is a better deal if you&#x27;re already looking to try Stadia — as one Reddit user points out, playing the trials of games like Hotline Miami is actually a great way to see if Stadia&#x27;s streaming will work with your network and hardware.

If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of money on a console or PC gaming rig, Stadia is a nice option, in theory, assuming that it works for you. Okay so maybe there are a lot of &quot;ifs&quot; at play here, but that never stopped Google, clearly.
Regardless of the logistics, others on Reddit praised the trial model, and said they wished Steam would do the same thing. Games are expensive, and only raising in price, so it makes sense that players would want to try out a game before they commit to dropping some major cash for the full thing. If you&#x27;ve ever looked at Google Stadia and thought, &quot;it&#x27;s a good idea, but...&quot; this is a good no-risk opportunity to give it the ol&#x27; college try.

                              <span>The company tries to cool concerns about $45 Overwatch 2 skins
A survey making the rounds in Overwatch circles has caused quite a commotion over the sequel&#x27;s monetization plans. But Blizzard Entertainment has issued a statement saying the survey is &quot;not indicative&quot; of the final product.
The Overwatch 2 survey, as shared on social media by Twitter user Portergauge, asks some questions about various tiers of skin prices for Overwatch 2. It asks about Legendary skins, priced out at $24.99 or bundled with more cosmetics for more cash, and &quot;Mythic&quot; skins, priced at $44.99.
These supposed $45 skins caused some commotion. Overwatch 2 is moving towards a loot box-less model, and that will mean some different monetization, as the multiplayer is going free-to-play.
Right now though, Blizzard is sayi…</span>

[Update: Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS4/PS5), Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PS4/PS5), and Little Nightmares (PS4) can now be claimed by PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers — and more Yakuza games are on the way.]
Right on cue, the sneaky petes over at Dealabs have leaked Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus offerings for the coming month of August — and this one is a real doozy, as subscribers at the Essential tier or higher will bag themselves the fantastic releases Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS4/PS5), Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PS4/PS5), and Little Nightmares (PS4).

                              <span>The long-awaited update is &#x27;making very good progress,&#x27; according to ConcernedApe
While fans have understandably grown impatient waiting for the much-later Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile update, the game&#x27;s creator assures us that it is still on the way. In the latest status check, Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone said on Twitter that 1.5 may be ready before the end of 2022 — a far-off ETA, for sure, but something to latch onto at least.
&quot;The 1.5 update for [Stardew Valley] mobile is making very good progress,&quot; he tweeted. &quot;It should be out before the end of the year. Mobile players... thanks for your patience.&quot;
Update 1.5 includes Ginger Island, a new getaway to explore and expand, as well as numerous improvements to the core game. You can have a fish tank, watch ducks swim, move your bed, sit on chairs, raise ostriches, and try a beach farm layout. The list goes on.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_337736&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot;] Ginger Islands is one of the best parts of Stardew Valley.[/caption]
From the sound of it, all Barone can really do is relay and reiterate information as the Stardew Valley porting team continues working on the expansive update. And, in the meantime, he&#x27;s busy working on his upcoming life-sim game, Haunted Chocolatier.
Whenever the day comes, there&#x27;s going to be a huge sigh of relief. Android and iOS players have been waiting for anything concrete, and with today&#x27;s news, we&#x27;re getting there.
This is the kind of long-lasting game that players (and the creator) can&#x27;t seem to walk away from, and update 1.5, in particular, is a culmination of everything it represents as a wholesome slice-of-life experience. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again — Ginger Island is a highlight, and it&#x27;s wild that it&#x27;s a free update. I loved searching for collectibles.

After hosting an open beta in May, GungHo Online Entertainment and Supertrick Games have announced a new, later-than-expected release window for Deathverse: Let It Die on PS4 and PS5. The hack-and-slash carnage will now have to wait until fall 2022.
As producer Shuji Ishikawa explained on the PlayStation Blog, the team chose to hold Deathverse: Let It Die past its original spring launch &quot;due to the results from the open beta.&quot;
The developers are &quot;working hard to make this game the best it can be,&quot; according to Ishikawa, and part of that means &quot;incorporating the feedback from the open beta survey.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;The total walkable area&quot;
Just how big is the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world compared to the second game? A whopping five times as large, according to the developers.
This raw figure was disclosed via part three of an official developer interview series, featuring Tetsuya Takahashi (senior director and chief creative officer at Monolith Soft), Koh Kojima (producer and director at Monolith Soft), and Genki Yokota (producer and director at Nintendo).
After being asked about the scope of the game, and how big it was intended to be as the third entry in a major series, Kojima laughed, and really let loose just how big the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world really is:
&quot;Come to think of it, we were just talking about this yesterday in the office. That the world would be crazy big for this title. So I actually did the math, and it turns out that the total walkable area in this game is over five times larger than in the second title. It was like... &quot;Yikes!&quot;

Kojima elaborates, citing the hindsight of accumulated knowledge from prior games to really allow this map to sing. This allowed the team to get more &quot;creative&quot; instead of just re-using variations of the same landscape concepts, and cites the danger of over-designing things like &quot;wall pattern&quot; aesthetics, which can cut into development time needed to implement more gameplay. Draw distance was apparently a priority though, and I think that was a good call — despite the limitations of the Switch hardware, the game managed to really surprise me at times with some amazing-looking vistas.

                              <span>Right now a combination of a Box discount and an Ebay voucher code are making two MSI AiO liquid CPU coolers extremely cheap. The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

                              <span>Herschel &quot;Guy&quot; Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a &quot;AAA game studio&quot; with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio&#x27;s first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it&#x27;s a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society&#x27;s first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it&#x27;s less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games.

As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t help that Beahm tweeted, &quot;I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine&quot; back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty&#x27;s visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen.

Even if you&#x27;ve made it rich in Sea of Thieves and are loaded to the gills in gold, you can only purchase one of each type of ship: the Sloop, Brigantine, and Galleon. Within the teaser video above, we see the Sloop goes for 250,000 gold, the Brigantine for 375,000, and the four-person Galleon at 500,000. Once one of these vessels is yours for the keeping, you can give it a name, and it&#x27;ll appear on a wooden plaque on the ship&#x27;s crest.

                              <span>To reduce piracy on the Switch console, last week Nintendo used a DMCA notice to target a popular &#x27;sigpatch&#x27; repository on Github. While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

Pár týdnů práce vývojářů (no, vlastně jde prakticky jen o Gerta Wollnyho) nyní vyústilo v rozšíření této funkcionality i na starší modely. Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.</span>

                              <span>Update: The same card is now on sale at Ebuyer for £310 - the next best price after CCL&#x27;s stock sold out. Original article continues below: 
I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL&#x27;s excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will finally hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC too, in just a few months – Oct. 25 to be exact – and Warner Bros and WB Montreal have been steadily releasing more and more information about the multiplayer Bat-family game. 
Today, as part of IGN First coverage, the studio released the first 16 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay and the focus is exclusively on Batgirl. If you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, don&#x27;t fret – there&#x27;s not much revealed story-wise in this gameplay, but it does feature a look at the first mission as well as some of the in-game mechanics we&#x27;ll be utilizing to solve mysteries and fight crime. According to the video, this takes place right after the prologue. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Gotham Knights, be sure to watch this Batgirl-centric trailer and then check out this one detailing some of Robin&#x27;s moveset. After that, check out Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s executive producer and director for details about alternate suits, missions, and the Elseworlds-like cooperative play.

However, it wasn&#x27;t the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. 
I played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I&#x27;m glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR&#x27;s latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all. CDPR choosing not to give reviewers codes for tho…</span>

If it&#x27;s like past presentations, we&#x27;ll likely get a trailer or two for the upcoming ninth generation of Pokémon as well as new details regarding the world of these games. I&#x27;m hoping we get a look at the mid-stage evolutions of the starters and more information about the region.

                              <span>Disney revealed back in May that its upcoming Rogue One prequel series, Andor, would premiere on Disney Plus on Aug. 31. Disney has delayed its release by a few weeks as it will now premiere on Sept. 21. However, on Sept. 21, three episodes will go live. 
This news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney. Running nearly two and a half minutes long, this trailer sets up the beginning of a rebellion led by Andor and others such as Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma (all played by the actors that portrayed them in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). You can check it out for yourself below: 


Elsewhere, Disney also released a fancy new illustrated poster for Andor today:

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. 
One of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. 
“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” 
If you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. 
You’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).
In the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review.

                              <span>I assumed we must have written about The Siege And The Sandfox before, but nope. It therefore falls to me to tell you about this &quot;2D stealth Metroidvania&quot;. Those words alone are enough to get me interested, but there&#x27;s a trailer below that shows it in action if you need a little more.

If you&#x27;re not so lucky, then good news: Valve say they&#x27;re speeding up production and everyone who has currently ordered one should receive their Steam Deck before the end of the year.

                              <span>Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest update introduced a new player reporting tool, which allows players to submit &quot;inappropriate chat messages or dangerous behaviour&quot; for moderators to review. That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren&#x27;t happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don&#x27;t like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

I&#x27;ve had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that&#x27;s down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

A two-week TorrentFreak investigation has determined that members of MPA-Canada and ACE, including Bell and Rogers, have been tracking the service&#x27;s operators for years. Legal action is already underway, but the process isn&#x27;t going exactly to plan.

                              <span>All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA&#x27;s official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don&#x27;t think so, you can call into Madden NFL&#x27;s ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA&#x27;s snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA&#x27;s involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...
@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ

89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!

Yo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!

The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year&#x27;s ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player&#x27;s rating? We&#x27;ll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I&#x27;d call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
EA Sports PGA Tour
First announced in 2021 with a Spring 2022 launch window, PGA Tour marks EA’s return to making golf games after a years-long hiatus. The publisher nabbed exclusive rights to the Masters Tournament and the game even includes the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t know much more about the game besides a few courses and events, and EA has on…</span>

                              <span>One of the allures of PC gaming is building your rig to the specs you need. Last year, while I didn&#x27;t pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT&#x27;s streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.
If you don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.
When you go to Build Redux&#x27;s website, you see the option to build your PC, but not in the way you would expect. You pick your top three games from a preset list of f…</span>

                              <span>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23&#x27;s on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We&#x27;ll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix&#x27;s Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA&#x27;s Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>&quot;A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.&quot; This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game&#x27;s fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can&#x27;t dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game&#x27;s other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 03 update, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</span>

                              <span>Piracy lawsuits should be pretty straightforward. Rightsholders must provide solid evidence that someone shared a copy of their content without permission. However, in a piracy case filed by adult entertainment company Strike 3 the purported &quot;Hollywood style quality&quot; of the porn videos is now a topic of contention.

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

                              <span>During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

                              <span>Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

Díky sekvenování DNA známe dědičnou informaci mnoha organismů a tím pádem i proteinů, které produkují. Problém je v ve velmi složitém 3D poskládání proteinu, který má velký vliv na výsledné vlastnosti. Připomeňme například přes dvacet let starý a stále běžící distribuovaný projekt Folding@Home.</span>

Čeká vás odpoledne workshopů a přednášek věnovaných Fedoře, kde se budete mít šanci seznámit a diskutovat s dalšími vývojáři, přispěvateli a uživateli. Pokud byste se chtěli zapojit jako přednášející, během odpoledne se budou sbírat návrhy na lightning talky, které program uzavřou. Poté jsou všichni účastníci vítáni na večerním posezení u piva v brněnském Technologickém Parku.</span>

It was previously aiming to release in September, but in an update on Twitter the developers say Darktide will now launch on November 30th. 

The upside is that they&#x27;re going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

There was some fresh gameplay for Thirsty Suitors and Hindsight, plus a newly revealed game from Wilmot’s Warehouse devs Hollow Ponds. We were treated to a few glimpses at what Kentucky Route Zero team Cardboard Computer and If Found… devs Dreamfeel are working on too. The latter involves cats.
Don’t fret if you didn’t catch the Annapurna Interactive stream today, because we’ve got all the info you need to know right here. Read on!

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

                              <span>Alice is away this week, leaving the lads to their own devices to discuss the best nice blokes in video games. A coincidence? Who can say. What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

                              <span>The world’s greatest detective who isn’t Batman will once again tangle with the many-tentacled forces of darkness in an upcoming remake of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

                              <span>I really appreciate when games don&#x27;t hold your hand. They don&#x27;t waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can&#x27;t freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

                              <span>Following an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, five people have been charged with distributing pirate IPTV services. RCMP officers raided GaloTV (Soltv) in 2021, seizing hundreds of set-top boxes, receivers and broadcasting devices. One of the men was previously sued by DISH and agreed to settle a civil suit for more than half a billion dollars.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.</span>

                              <span>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.
A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</span>

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. 


Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you&#x27;re not blasting apart enemies, you&#x27;ll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister&#x27;s wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex&#x27;s emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala&#x27;s mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It&#x27;s a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you&#x27;re still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade&#x27;s most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.
A dev diary during today&#x27;s Annapurna Showcase doesn&#x27;t reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog&#x27;s face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy. 
Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero here.</span>

During The Playlist, Van Aken raves about Rollerdrome and shares why it&#x27;s one of his most anticipated games after playing it. To round out the show, we answer a few listener questions about how the Steam Deck compares to the Nintendo Switch and which portable games we&#x27;d like to re-release onto home consoles.

                              <span>During February’s Nintendo Direct, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got a lot of overdue attention with the announcement of 48 race tracks – new and old – coming to the arcade racer by 2023. The first wave dropped in March alongside a 2.0 update. Wave 2 is just around the bend and promises the Turnip and Propeller Cups next month. This means we’re getting some familiar courses across multiple consoles, including the Super NES, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, Wii, and Mario Kart Tour games. Here are the details for each cup based on a recent press release:

                              <span>Now&#x27;s the time to claim Japan&#x27;s seedy underbelly for yourself. Yakuza: Like A Dragon is packaged into the free PlayStation Plus August catalog. However, eight other Yakuza are coming to the subscription service starting this month.
According to the official PlayStation blog, Extra and Premium members can download/play Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s classic, crime-riddled journeys in Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 next month. Later this year, those same subscribers get access to Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, and Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. That&#x27;s hundreds of hours of fantastic Ryu Ga Gotoku content. Be sure to check out our reviews or previews for the games below:
Yakuza 0

Yakuza 6

Last week, screenshots of the next Yakuza game surfaced. Whether we&#x27;re in for a numbered entry or sequel to Like A Dragon remains to be seen. But we know that the lovable Ichiban Kasuga and co. are making their triumphant return.</span>

It’s Tuesday morning. I’m late. I’ve missed the embargo deadline for Rollerdrome. Across the games press, website authors have already published previews and stories about their time playing Roll7’s blood-packed sports title. 
But I can’t stop playing Rollerdrome. 
Instead of writing, I once again queue the Barbican Arena competition, the last leg in my six-level demo. The level begins in a long, claustrophobic tunnel lit in red light. I have everything I need – rollerskates and a shotgun – to put on the show of a lifetime. Ahead of me are echoes of a crowd clapping in unison, an ominous metronome inv…</span>

                              <span>Since the disclosure of Retbleed earlier this month as the newest CPU security vulnerability around speculative execution, I&#x27;ve posted some Intel/AMD benchmarks looking at the mitigation cost for the affected older generations of processors. Last week I also looked at the accumulated CPU mitigation cost on AMD Zen 1. Today is a similar comparison over on the Intel Xeon E3 v5 &quot;Skylake&quot; side with looking at the cost of just the Retbleed mitigations and then the overall CPU mitigation cost when toggling all of the various vulnerabilities with the &quot;mitigations&#x3D;off&quot; flag.</span>

                              <span>In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play a new Bayonetta game in just a few short months. But hey, let&#x27;s not forget the classics, either. 
Today on Game Informer Live, we&#x27;re revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive people will say is one of the best games of all time. 
But that&#x27;s not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the first and second archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we&#x27;re finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together. 
We&#x27;re going live on our Twitch page at 3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg posted a new report about Grand Theft Auto 6&#x27;s development, based on sources close to or within Rockstar Games. The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game&#x27;s design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …</span>

                              <span>The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

We&#x27;ve got two Samsung drives here, the PCIe 3.0 Samsung 980 and the PCIe 4.0 Samsung 980 Pro, as well as another strong PCIe 4.0 option, the Crucial P5 Plus. All three offer great value for money at their reduced price point, so let&#x27;s cover each in turn!

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

                              <span>Strategy games are the go-to option when you&#x27;re looking for something to really get your brain working. But they can seem unreachable when your synapses are being melted from without rather than through overuse. Happily, we found an excellent solution last summer, and being a wily fox, I had a plan ready for this year. 2022&#x27;s now-traditional Low-Intensity Strategy Game For When Burny Light Make Think Hard is, of course, The Battle For Polytopia.

                              <span>When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. &quot;Usually, by the time a game comes out, I&#x27;ve compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven&#x27;t done that with Hob&#x27;s Barrow yet,&quot; he says. &quot;Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it.&quot;
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce &quot;Incantamentum&quot; correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. &quot;I said, &#x27;Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you&#x27;re going to be adding voice acting to this because it&#x27;s screaming for it&#x27;,&quot; Gilbert tells me. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, we will if we can find a publisher who&#x27;ll do it for us.&#x27;&quot; So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

                              <span>There are some things in this world that just take you completely by surprise. Drop bears, for example. It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998&#x27;s terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser. You can watch the original pitch trailer for Jurassic World that Blackley created below.

                              <span>More information about Rockstar’s next Grand Theft Auto game has slipped out of a new report from Bloomberg. Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series&#x27; history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

See, Animal Crossing and animated Disney movies have both long been big deals in the Wheeler household, and the new game seemed to be riffing heavily on the former. A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.

                              <span>The Force isn’t strong with the remake of classic RPG Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, which has been delayed indefinitely following a badly received demo shown internally at the end of June. Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised. Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more &quot;realistic&quot;.

                              <span>Urbek City Builder looks like a traditional entry to the genre: you place buildings, cars and little people begin to scurry about, and you gradually expand your urban sprawl. The twist is that there&#x27;s no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building&#x27;s resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It&#x27;s out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

The same leak also includes the first screenshots of Reborn, and a feature list that suggests Reborn is more than a straight port of 2010&#x27;s Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together.

                              <span>Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you&#x27;re up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy&#x27;s going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games&#x27; chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
&quot;In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I&#x27;m fucked up,&quot; he tells me. &quot;In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.&quot;

                              <span>The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red&#x27;s fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD&#x27;s limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we&#x27;re starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

                              <span>&quot;Do you do Strava?&quot; people often ask upon learning I like cycling. This is not the question they wish to ask. They are trying to feel out a stereotype, attempting to maintain the civil spirit of small talk by not saying aloud, &quot;So are you a prick about cycling?&quot; To broach the subject of stats, let&#x27;s talk about Wren, an idle RPG powered by going for a real bike ride then connecting the game to your Strava or Fitbit. I got a puncture in the course of playing the game for this post, such is my dedication to you, reader dear.

Rollerskating has gone in and out of fashion too, and anyone who&#x27;s glanced at Instagram for the past couple of years will know which stage of the wave we&#x27;re at.

                              <span>Popular sports streaming site Rojadirecta has found itself on the losing end of a piracy battle in Italy.

However, the court didn&#x27;t grant all Mediaset&#x27;s requests.

                              <span>Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn&#x27;t exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise&#x27;s excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…</span>

                              <span>WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let&#x27;s throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

                              <span>Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Ch. 2.

                              <span>Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg

Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a &quot;holy&quot; site. I&#x27;ll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there&#x27;s not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata&#x27;s best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, &quot;So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.&quot; McDonald also said that it&#x27;s impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…</span>

                              <span>American Truck Simulator&#x27;s tenth expansion is almost upon us. The freight simulator&#x27;s Montana DLC was announced in November last year, and now developers SCS Software say it&#x27;ll begin its journey on August 4th. There&#x27;s a new trailer and a longer in-game video to watch below.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards have hit a new low-water mark on Ebay, where a 10% off code (HOT10) has brought them to £660. This is the price for a Zotac Trinity model, but if you prefer Inno3D&#x27;s designs then you can get one of their cards for just £10 more. Either way, you get an impressive level of performance for half the price that some were paying just a few months ago.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 processors are getting ever cheaper, with the mid-range Ryzen 5 5600 today crossing the £130 barrier for the first time. You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

The Hollywood-supported group says it has reached a €70,000 settlement with a major vendor after information exposed through the court located the person in Brazil. BREIN, meanwhile, reports that it has shut down dozens of illicit IPTV vendors and hundreds of sites that offered these services.

                              <span>Christopher Boomer, whose games have been viewed over two billion times, recently obtained a DMCA subpoena compelling Roblox to identify alleged pirates. In its response, Roblox says the subpoena could affect hundreds of thousands of innocent gamers. In an interesting twist, Roblox cites a recent high-profile DMCA case involving Twitter and the right to anonymous speech.

                              <span>Hey, I don&#x27;t want to go to work today. I want to stay home and play all my video games. Luckily, I can do just that. Care to join?
Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I&#x27;ll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix&#x27;s fantastic Neon White on our Twitch channel. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my highest score ever, if you&#x27;re wondering – but I&#x27;m starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal. 
After that, I&#x27;ll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build from last week. We&#x27;re building the Real Grade Wing Gundam, and there&#x27;s still lots to work on. Come watch these little hands cut, sand, and assemble.
Hope to see you there!</span>
