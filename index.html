                              <span>The old waiting game...
Square Enix has splurged out on a selection of mysterious trademarks, recently filed in Japan and seemingly related to its iconic RPG title Final Fantasy VII Remake as well as multiple unknown IPS.
The first of the three trademarks, as noted by Gematsu, is for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. A title that is already available on PS5 and PC via Epic Games Store. The trademark could suggest that a re-release is being prepared, perhaps for the PC via the Steam Store or for another platform entirely.
The other two trademarks are a total mystery, and see the publisher lay claim to &quot;Final Bar Line&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth Striker&quot;. Interestingly, both titles sound like they&#x27;d be more fitting as subtitles than actual game names, which has led some to theorize that they may represent spin-offs from some of Square&#x27;s franchises, such as Kingdom Hearts, Dragon Quest, or, of course, Final Fantasy itself.
For now, it all remains little more than speculation. But, with another summer of gaming reveals up ahead, it will be interesting to see if any of these new names will be coming into play in the latter half of 2022.

                              <span>Player Toxicity Expected
Funcom has released a new trailer for its upcoming doomsday shooter Metal: Hellsinger — the new video features the unmistakable vocals of Serj Tankian, long-time frontman of metal band System of a Down. Tankian joins a roster of metal legends that will soundtrack the next-gen shooter&#x27;s violent chaos.
&quot;What can you even say! We have so many System of a Down fans in the studio, adding Serj Tankian to our already incredible roster of vocalists feels unreal,&quot; said David Goldfarb of developer The Outsiders. &quot;He completely killed the track and made it his own in a way only Serj could. We are so excited and can’t wait to see everyone playing!&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vig4_lsrpto
As FPS fans will immediately note, Metal: Hellsinger features the typically apocalyptic vibe of the genre&#x27;s roots, founded in titles such as Doom, Hexen, Quake, and Heretic. In a fun new twist on the classic first-person gameplay, however, players will be rewarded for their ability to run &#x27;n&#x27; gun to the beat of the game&#x27;s bass-pounding score, chaining together combos and meaty acts of destruction in time with the music — A gimmick similarly explored to solid effect in 2021 release BPM: Bullets per Minute.
Tankian joins a horn-throwing roster of composers that already includes Arch Enemy&#x27;s Alissa White-Gluz, Trivium&#x27;s Matt Heafy, and the dulcet tones of Lamb of God&#x27;s Randy Blythe. More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. It feels as though Mike Patton should most definitely be here, but the Faith No More/Fantomas frontman is currently taking a well-earned sabbatical from work, so that may just be wishful thinking on my part.
Metal: Hellsinger is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

It&#x27;s Thursday, so you know what that means! No, not being disappointed that Harmonix still hasn&#x27;t added in &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; as Rock Band DLC. That&#x27;s certainly my Thursday tradition, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be yours. I&#x27;m of course talking about Super Rare Games putting out another limited-run game on Switch! Up for grabs in this week&#x27;s contest is Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos.
Strictly limited to 4,000 copies, this one is destined to sell out — whoops my bad! I couldn&#x27;t even make it through writing this post without it selling out. It&#x27;s gone. Considering you can&#x27;t buy it anymore, you might as well win a copy here!

Classic PlayStation games are coming to PS4 and PS5 in June with the new $120-per-year PlayStation Plus Premium tier, and as it turns out, they&#x27;ll have trophies — at least, some of the games will. In a tweet this afternoon, Bend Studio shared a surprise clip featuring an all-new trophy, &quot;An Explosive Start,&quot; for the PS1 classic Syphon Filter.
In a response to a fan on Twitter, Bend Studio design manager Eric Jensen said he &quot;helped out with a few of [the trophies], mostly naming.&quot;

With the disappointing release of Fallout 76 almost five years behind us, fans of the series are itching for any and all updates on the future of the beloved IP. Bethesda, on the other hand, seems to have its hands full with Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls title, so the odds of getting any new official Fallout are looking pretty slim. Thankfully, the fans are willing to take things into their own hands, because the Fallout modding community just dropped a huge bomb, as it were: Fallout London, a DLC-sized story mod of Fallout 4 that explores life after the nuclear apocalypse in England.
Fallout London&#x27;s development team released a gameplay trailer that clocks in at just over eighteen minutes long, which first shows scenes of various …</span>

                              <span>Fans are up in arms, but I think they have a point
The Iron Giant was an important movie to me growing up. I always loved the animation style, and although it&#x27;s a movie that&#x27;s known for being a tear-jerker, it earns it with some excellent writing. It&#x27;s a shame that Warner Bros. Animation shut down in 2004, because they had some truly iconic films back in the day. I don&#x27;t know anyone who wasn&#x27;t touched by the story of friendship and pacifism that we saw from The Iron Giant. I think a lot of us who grew up with the film feel a bit protective over it because of how earnest it was — or at least, that&#x27;s how I feel. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m up in arms about the Iron Giant kicking some ass in MultiVersus, and I know I&#x27;m not the only one who feels that way.

                              <span>Players have speculated that Obi-Wan Kenobi could be making his way to Fortnite soon for a number of reasons. For starters, the upcoming Disney Plus show, Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins next week and Disney and Fortnite have an extensive history of collaborating ahead of big releases like movies or TV shows. There’s also the fact that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber is already in Fortnite as it was one of four added to the game during its May the Fourth Star Wars Celebration period. 
Now, it’s official: the Jedi master is coming to Fortnite to find the high ground. More specifically, he’ll hit the Fortnite Item Shop on Thursday, May 26, at 8 p.m. ET. That’s just in time for his big Disney Plus show, which begins the next day. As for what to expect, here’s a look:

                              <span>TT Games’ Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga hit consoles and PC last month and since its release, it’s received two new character packs. Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. 
While this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.


Here’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: 
Numerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:
Issue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.
Issue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.
Issue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.
Implemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:
Fulminatrix
Home One
Invisible Hand
Venator
As you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect.

Bend Studio announced in a tweet today that Syphon Filter is going to come packed with trophies to obtain when it releases as part of the upcoming PlayStation Plus expansion. The tweet reads, &quot;Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus.&quot; The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called &quot;An Explosive Start.&quot; A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name &quot;Excellent work, Agent.&quot;
With the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.
PlayStation Plus&#x27; revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.

We&#x27;ve got a bounty of new Live A Live news! Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming remake of the Super Famicom RPG received a livestream today, featuring the director of the original and producer of the remake, Takashi Tokita, and the now-legendary composer of the original, Yoko Shimomura. And in that stream, we got a handful of new trailers that each show off one of four different time periods.
We&#x27;ve already seen Prehistory and Imperial China, so these next four will be new to anyone not familiar with the game. One thing to say, though, is they all look amazing. Thanks to Square Enix Asia for posting the English trailers!

This past week Capcom has been releasing video demonstrations for the many weapons of Monster Hunter Rise, with a focus on new Switch Skills that&#x27;ll be introduced with the Sunbreak expansion. Another three videos have now landed to showcase more smart moves.
This time around we have the Bow, Charge Blade and Gunlance, all very useful in the right hands. The Bow in particular wins a lot of style points in terms of the moveset and some of the hunter animations - if you&#x27;re going to take down monsters from a distance, you may as well do it with extra flair.

TT Games&#x27; LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has just received its first update on Switch. In what has become the LEGO game with the biggest launch of all time, The Skywalker Saga has been upgraded to version 1.0.4 to give the game a little bit more Force. Or just make it a bit more stable, really.
Little fixes are always welcome, and there are a couple of Episode-related issues that might have tripped a few eager brick Jedi up. Here are the patch notes straight from Warner Bros.&#x27; LEGO Games Support:

This review originally went live in 2015, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival on Switch as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

                              <span>PROJECT-TRITRI to be revealed next week.
Japanese publisher FuRyu — known for bringing us RPGs The Alliance Alive, The Caligula Effect, and Monark — has launched a countdown for a brand new action RPG, PROJECT-TRITRI. Obviously that&#x27;s not going to be the final title... unless FuRyu is going for Project Octopath Traveler and Project Triangle Strategy vibes.
The game is currently in development by Three Rings, who has worked on the wholesome Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town. We won&#x27;t find out much more about the game until 26th May, but we know it&#x27;s coming to Switch (and PlayStation 4 and 5) and is aiming for a Q2 2022 release date, which is *checks calendar* pretty soon! The week wait might be a bit agonising for JRPG fans, but we have a few teasers to get us even more excited. All of the information we&#x27;ve included below has been translated by Gematsu — so thanks, Gematsu!

Switch Online&#x27;s Nintendo 64 application received an update earlier today bumping it up to Version 2.3.0. Apart from the release of Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, it seems Nintendo has also made some adjustments behind the scenes.
Nintendo doesn&#x27;t release patch notes for app updates like this one, but there are other ways of finding out what&#x27;s changed. Well-known Nintendo dataminer OatmealDome reveals adjustments to a number of existing N64 titles including Star Fox 64, Dr. Mario 64 and Mario Golf - which serves as a reminder Nintendo is continually improving the overall experience of the N64 library on Switch.

Nintendo is always filing patents for all sorts of ideas, but they don&#x27;t always see the light of day. This latest one might be a bit different though.
This new one will target cheaters by attempting to identify any software modifications. This would be achieved by implementing an attestation program that continues to check for possible code changes to the software.

                              <span>The May update for Amazon Games and Smilegate’s multiplayer online action RPG Lost Ark introduces a new class this week that really enjoys smashing things up: the Destroyer. The ‘Destined For Destruction’ update also brings a brand-new Guardian Raid, Deskaluda, which looks like a dragon made out of Victorian iron fencing and ooze-green Dulux. Axe-wielding goat lad Valtan arrives this month to finally incorporate team-based Legion Raids into the Western version of Lost Ark too.

                              <span>We did a lot of cool things during our time at this year&#x27;s PAX East. We attended a wonderful talk by &quot;Skyrim Grandma&quot; Shirley Curry. We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show&#x27;s official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge.

The Future Games Show is back on June 11th at 12pm PST/8pm BST, while the PC Gaming Show is set for 12.30pm PST/8.30pm BST on June 12th. I&#x27;ll delude myself into thinking that’s pretty much everything happening that weekend scheduled now.

Most of them come out of Summer Game Fest, Geoff Keighley’s annual onslaught of livestreams and world premieres, but there are a few non-Keighley branded streams taking place as well. To help you get a grip on what’s going on and when, we’ve compiled all of the announced presentations with dates, times, and a brief description of what each entails. We&#x27;ll update this list as more livestreams are announced.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 was announced late last night, and I can’t stop watching the short trailer that debuted the title. Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous. We have almost no information on the game as of now, but that won’t stop us from thinking about the possibilities of what may come with SF6 or what we want the next big chapter in the series to be.
Capcom is no stranger to live service games, nor do they lack experience in seasonal content. Street Fighter V had plenty of both, with four seasons of new characters, plenty of costumes, and new stages. N…</span>

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
EA Sports PGA Tour

The publisher nabbed exclusive rights to the Masters Tournament and the game even includes the Ladies Professional Golf Association.

However, after leaving Activision, Sledgehammer Games, and the Call of Duty franchise behind a few years ago, he wanted to do something new – something uncompromised.

                              <span>Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. 
Marvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. 


“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” 

At launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. 

Beginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. 
In regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more.

Editors John Carson, Alex Van Aken, Marcus Stewart, and Alex Stadnik will do battle in the MultiVersus closed alpha to see how Warner Bros. zany take on Smash Bros. style fighting is shaping up.

The delayed new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be released in Q4 of 2022. 
Back in April, CD Projekt Red announced that it had taken the development of a new-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in-house and that as a result of this shift, the update had been essentially indefinitely delayed. Following reports that the delay was in &quot;development hell,&quot; CDPR put out a notice that this was not the case and now we know that the new-gen update will be released sometime in the final three months of this year. 
Let&#x27;s make this 7th anniversary even better, shall we?

Player First Games is well on its way to releasing its fighting game MultiVersus, a new multiplayer platform brawler that pits the extensive list of characters from the Warner Bros. catalog against one another in chaotic button-mashing battles. It&#x27;s easy to compare MultiVersus to other fighting games in the genre, like Nintendo&#x27;s juggernaut Super Smash Bros., but after spending a handful of hours throwing fists, kicks, and lasers with the WB crew, there&#x27;s plenty that impressed me about MultiVersus that makes it stand out, and should be a game to …</span>

It is currently untitled but the Ukraine-based studio, which is planning to relocate its developers to safety with help from an Epic MegaGrant from Epic Games, is referring to it as Project Palianytsia. Alongside this working title, Frogwares has released four pieces of concept art to set up the game, which it calls “a mix of eldritch horror coupled with Victorian-era mystery.” It says the game is aimed at fans of The Sinking City and its Sherlock Holmes series. 

“We are revealing the game now in this way to simply show people we are pushing on and also as a clear middle finger to those who thought they could just roll into our country hoping to disrupt and ruin our lives,” Frogwares communications ma…</span>

                              <span>Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

Photorealism in games can be really fun. Having characters and environments that look just like real life can help immerse you in a game&#x27;s world, and it can be exciting to see how graphics continue to improve year after year. But here&#x27;s the thing — I sometimes feel like we can obsess a bit too much over how real or not real a certain game&#x27;s art style is, picking apart every environment and every little detail on the character models.
I think back to the PS1 era, when people thought that the first Metal Gear game was as realistic-looking as they come. Players gushed about the immersion because of how lifelike it was. We laugh about it now, but anecdotes like that really speak to how much our minds fill in the gaps when it comes to storytelling, somet…</span>

A new collectible card game is mixing superheroes and villains with some digital card game talent. Marvel Snap is a new CCG set in the Marvel universe, from a team founded by former Hearthstone developers.
In today&#x27;s reveal, we get a good look at the general art style before heading into some Marvel Snap gameplay. Snap is taking a multiverse approach, with tons of Marvel characters represented in card form.
Decks consist of 12 unique cards, as players duke it out over different cubes and zones. Both players play simultaneously, vying for cosmic cubes.

There are also multiple locations to win, and the ability to double-down if you think you&#x27;re sure to win. It has some Gwent vibes to it, which is a bit …</span>

It appears that the fanservice fanatics over at CyGames are getting set to launch a brand new franchise, following on from its application for &quot;Akiba Maid War&quot; with The Japan Trademark Association.
Cygames, renown for cutesy cult franchises such as Granblue Fantasy, The Idolmaster, and Dragalia Lost, was granted the trademark on May 10, picking up the domain name for the property soon after. No details were revealed as to the context of Akiba Maid War, with only a simple logo released so far. As noted by Gematsu, the Japanese text &quot;Akiba Meido Sensou&quot; is a fun pun, as &quot;Meido&quot; is phonetically pronounced &quot;Maid&quot; but as written is the word for &quot;Underworld.&quot;
That&#x27;s all well and good, CyGames, but frankly, I just want my tea and biscuits. Failing that, I just want to dress up as a maid. No doubt we will hear more about Akiba Maid War as the year progresses, as it&#x27;s getting to be about that time. Maybe it&#x27;ll be a great third-person console adventure, maybe it will be a garbage gacha mobile game. Until Cygames is ready to spill the tea, it could go either way. Schrodinger&#x27;s Maid, if you will. (You won&#x27;t.)

                              <span>June is starting to stack up
Summer is just around the corner. Alongside the sunshine and blue skies, more games showcases are cropping up for the annual airing of game showcases, like the Future Games Show.
GamesRadar+ announced today that the Future Games Show will air on Saturday, June 11 at 3 p.m. ET / noon PT. The show will air on Twitch, YouTube, and several other major streaming locales.
https://twitter.com/FutureGamesShow/status/1527334286893801488
The show advertises it will have &quot;over 60 minutes&quot; of trailers, world premieres, and surprises in store.
Are you ready for the summer?
It&#x27;s the middle of May, just a few weeks out now from June, and already the month is getting lined up. Several showcases are already slotting their times in for the second weekend in June, kicking off with Summer Game Fest Live on June 9.
The sister show of Future, PC Gamer&#x27;s PC Gaming Show, airs the following day (June 12) at 3:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 p.m. PT. And on the same day as Future Games Show, both the Guerrilla Collective and the Wholesome Games Direct will show off some games too.
Xbox and Bethesda, meanwhile, air their joint showcase on June 12 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT.
Other major platforms and publishers, including Sony, Nintendo, and Square Enix, have yet to formally announce their plans. Several signs are pointing to some Final Fantasy news in June though, so we can expect to see something from the publisher then.
All of these streams and announcements fall under the same week we&#x27;d usually be heading out for E3, even though there&#x27;s no E3 this year. The ESA confirmed it&#x27;s fully sitting out this year, planning to return in 2023. The Summer Game Fest has meanwhile risen in the interim, and will at least be kicking off the summer festivities. It&#x27;s not a normal year, but it hasn&#x27;t been for a while now. At least we know one weekend in June will still be crammed full of video game showcases.

Yep, yer boy Chris Moyse is here with more gaming news for those Of A Certain Age. Publisher Leonardo Interactive and developer Smallthings Studios have announced a brand new game starring one of the point &#x27;n&#x27; click genre&#x27;s formative home computing heroes, Simon the Sorcerer!
Neither a remaster nor a remake, Simon the Sorcerer Origins will be a prequel to the original 1993 Adventure Soft classic, as a rebellious young man falls under the tutelage of his friend, guide, and mentor, Calypso. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will retain the exploratory, point &#x27;n&#x27; click gameplay of yore, complete with item puzzles, a wide cast of characters, and a comical, tongue-in-cheek script.
Check out an early development trailer below, courtesy of IGN.

According to Leonardo Interactive, this officially licensed prequel features slick, cartoonish artworks, and sporting dynamic transitions that allow gameplay to flow seamlessly in and out of cutscenes. As players explore Simon&#x27;s newfound powers, they will learn of the events that led up to his mythical 1990s escapade.
Fresh off of Ron Gibert&#x27;s recent Return to Monkey Island announcement, point &#x27;n click fans will be stoked to hear of Simon&#x27;s return. Hopefully, this brand-new adventure will capture the magic and enchantment of its old-school roots. Simon the Sorcerer Origins will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

From today until Thursday, May 26, you can download Borderlands 3 for free from the Epic Games Store — or just add it to your never-actually-gonna-play-this PC game pile.
Is it worth your time? Well, that depends on how into Borderlands you were in the early days and how open to the series you are today. I&#x27;m the type of person who can tune out a lot of the grating NPC chatter and just enjoy the character-building, loot-snatching, kinda-mindless-in-a-good-way setup — but maybe that&#x27;s too tall of an order for you in 2022.
Borderlands 3 is particularly fun with co-op partners by your side (that goes for all of these games), and there are neat overpowered guns waiting to be found. Speaking of which, the PC version does allow cross-play, so if yo…</span>

Publisher Nacon delivered a lot of good news during yesterday&#x27;s Nacon Connect presentation — including the reveal of a GreedFall sequel and a new WRC title — but this was slightly offset by the bum news that the next entry in the Test Drive Unlimited series, Solar Crown, would no longer be meeting its originally planned 2022 release date.
&quot;With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development,&quot; writes Nacon in a statement on Steam. &quot;We therefore want to thank the fan community for your support and daily involvement on the game&#x27;s official Discord channel and within communities on the various social media platforms.
The attractive road racer, which was originally scheduled to launch this fall, will now arrive at some point in 2023. In addition, Nacon announced that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the sequel have been canceled, with Solar Crown now solely in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and, perhaps surprisingly, Nintendo Switch. Perhaps the most ambitious TDU title to date, Solar Crown hopes to fully replicate a digital version of Hong Kong Island as the backdrop for its polished, high-speed racing action.
Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is currently in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. A closed beta is expected to launch later in 2022.

Cotton Fantasy is relatively noteworthy game, a localization of Cotton Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll. It&#x27;s a cute &#x27;em up that involves a witch riding a broomstick: so I&#x27;m sold in theory already. You can find the rest of the eShop offerings below. Other releases include Touken Ranbu Warriors and Deadcraft.
At the moment, we&#x27;re kind of just waiting for the other shoe to drop. June is going to be a packed month, and will host both Mario Strikers: Battle League and Fire Emblem: Three Hopes (which I really want to call Three Fates). Surely, there will be a few &quot;surprise drops&quot; in there somewhere.

                              <span>The shinier Wild Hunt looms closer
Geralt&#x27;s adventures won&#x27;t be waiting too long to hit the newer generation of consoles. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt next-gen version is now slated to launch sometime in Q4 2022.
The news arrives today via The Witcher Twitter account, roughly lining up with the seventh anniversary of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s launch. The next-gen version, which should bring The Witcher 3 onto PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as its own version, is planned to release in Q4 2022.
https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1527299944834510854
The next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has slid around a fair bit. It moved into 2022 and then, most recently, slid into an undefined window. Alongside that news, CD Projekt also confirmed that it was bringing development in-house, rather than over at Saber Interactive. The team at Saber had previously handled The Witcher 3&#x27;s Nintendo Switch port.
Something ends, something begins
CD Projekt had this next-gen version in the works alongside Cyberpunk 2077 next-gen. The latter launched in February, in a surprising reveal and release event.
But while Cyberpunk 2077 is a fairly new game, it&#x27;s been seven years since the launch of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It&#x27;s a massive game, but it&#x27;s fair to say that Witcher fans would probably like to see how the world looks on newer hardware.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vOnpO5A7bAU
Anticipation for new Witcher content is likely also higher than usual, thanks to the recent announcement of a new Witcher in development. The next step in The Witcher universe is being made in Unreal Engine 5 at CD Projekt Red.
The studio has also been strictly calling it a new saga. With a new step forward in the world, it&#x27;d be nice to have a next-gen version of Geralt&#x27;s journey too. The old witcher got a nice send-off with Blood and Wine, and it&#x27;d be nice to re-experience that.
We&#x27;ll see what CD Projekt Red&#x27;s got in store as the year rolls on.

                              <span>Stunt casting the full game would be fun
Four years ago, God of War smashed into the industry and made a lasting impact. Before the sequel comes out and likely does the same, we can enjoy this God of War Simpsons mod.
Created as part of Omega Fantasy&#x27;s Patreon, the mod swaps out Kratos for Homer, and his son Atreus for Bart — with Flanders butting in as &quot;The Stranger.&quot; The gameplay is effectively the same, but you get the new character models (including a reworked [Wonder]bat instead of Kratos&#x27; Leviathan Axe). YouTuber ToastedShoes also managed to hire voice actors to add a finishing touch, which really makes the below video worth watching. They even completely change the script to make it more like one of those &quot;trilogy/what if&quot; Simpsons episodes.
The voices are done by Benjamin Rudman (Homer), June Briar (Bart), and Brock Baker (Flanders), and I have to say, the performances make it. You can&#x27;t really sell Flanders fighting Homer without some sort of &quot;diddly&quot; rant, and the relationship between Homer and Bart is even funnier with them talking directly to each other.
A lot of people in the YouTube comments are calling for a Peter Griffin versus the Chicken mod — and with plenty of Peter soundalikes out there, I think someone can make it happen.

Though Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands just launched, it sounds like even more is in the Gearbox pipeline. Gearbox has nine games currently in development that it denotes as AAA.
This news arrives via Embracer Group&#x27;s latest financial report, covering the fourth quarter and full year running April 2021 through March 2022. It&#x27;s a pretty extensive report, covering a lot of companies due to how massive Embracer is at this point.
In the Gearbox section, the report says the company plans to keep on growing, with nine AAA games currently in development.

In a new interview with the game&#x27;s own publisher, Square Enix, directors Kenji Saito and Takahisa Sugiyama have admitted to feeling dismayed at the reception to their epic fantasy RPG Babylon&#x27;s Fall, but remain committed to producing new content and in-game updates for the live service title.
Launching in March 2022 following a lengthy development cycle, Babylon&#x27;s Fall found itself swiftly subdued due to poor critical reception and a busy month of top-tier game releases. In a standout, (and heavily publicized moment), the Steam player base for the RPG reportedly fell from a meager 1,000 players to just one single player in early May.
Addressing the less-than-stellar launch in the new interview, Saito and Sugiyama expressed their intention to continue…</span>

It&#x27;s time to start blocking out your calendars for another summer of presentations, live streams, and online gatherings. In lieu of the typical (is it still typical?) E3 festivities, game developers and publishers will once again be taking to the airwaves to showcase their upcoming wares, projects, and plans for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.
One of the first to stake a claim by the pool is PC Gamer&#x27;s PC Gaming Show 2022, which is officially scheduled to take place on Sunday, June 12, at 12:30 PT / 15:30 ET / 20:30 BST. The show, which will be presented by hosted by Mica Burton and Sean &quot;Day[9]&quot; Plott, promises to feature world exclusive reveals, brand new trailers, developer interviews, and the most recent updates on some of the latest and greatest titles heading to the desktops of keyboard warriors everywhere.
Among the 45 titles expected to be spotlit as this year&#x27;s showcase, the audience can expect to see:
An unannounced game from 11 bit studios
A brand-new project from Klei Entertainment
An exclusive interview on Arma 4 with Bohemia Interactive
The final trailer for Sam Barlow&#x27;s mind-bending Immortality
New gameplay of the ambitious mod project Half-Life: Alyx - Levitation
An update on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 from Saber Interactive&#x27;s Tim Willits
First gameplay from the highly anticipated grand strategy game Victoria 3
Be sure to tune in to the official PC Gamer YouTube channel or the official PCGamingShow website on June 12. We will, of course, bring you all of the hottest headlines and biggest scoops right here on Destructoid. As we prepare for another hot summer of streams, I once again kindly request that Keighley and pals do their best to keep shenanigans under two hours. We have beds and families.

Blizzard Entertainment and beleaguered &quot;loot box&quot; mechanics are back in the legal crosshairs once again after an Arizona resident filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against the studio over its popular digital card-battler Hearthstone, currently played by millions on PC and mobile platforms.
As reported by Polygon, Nathan Harris filed the suit with Orange County&#x27;s California State Superior Court on behalf of his daughter, a fan of the fantasy trading card game. Harris proposed suit concerns the randomized nature of Hearthstone&#x27;s purchasable card packs, which they believe &quot;deceive&quot; children and younger players with promises of rare cards without fully disclosing the odds.
Between 2019 and 2020, It is alleged that Harris&#x27; daughter has spent in the re…</span>

                              <span>Rumored Remake Release Rumors
While developer Naughty Dog is yet to even officially confirm rumors of a remake of its magnum opus, The Last of Us, it seems that whispers in the wind are already pointing to the possibility that the revamped survival horror title will come crawling onto modern platforms as soon as 2022.
At least that&#x27;s the world according to GamesBeat reporter and known spoiler Jeff Grubb, who suggested as such on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. Citing his own sources, Grubb noted that he was &quot;pretty confident&quot; that a Last of Us remake is already pushing completion, and is likely to launch in the 2022 holiday season. It&#x27;s well worth noting that Grubb&#x27;s estimation matches that of fellow leak machine Tom Henderson, who has also previously speculated a Holiday 2022 launch on the PS5 platform.

First inklings of a remake of Naughty Dog&#x27;s highly acclaimed 2013 adventure surfaced in April 2021, following a consolidation of studios within Sony&#x27;s gaming division. It is believed that Sony pulled its San Diego-based “Visual Art Service Group” team off of the project, which led to unrest among its members, some of which referenced The Last of Us remake in a report to Bloomberg.
Around the same time, Sony Bend — who had reportedly begun work on a Days Gone sequel — was pulled off of the project in order to further assist Naughty Dog with its other major IP, Uncharted. These incidents led to a period of turmoil for many working within Sony&#x27;s gaming division who felt that they were being pushed away from their own projects and ideas to essentially assist in the development of &quot;cash cows.&quot;
In addition to the rumored remake, Naughty Dog is also currently developing the multiplayer component of The Last of Us Part II, and is assisting in the production of HBO&#x27;s TV adaptation.

Fans of narrative point-and-clicks have had a pretty good run of things recently. We had the gem that was NORCO earlier this year, Monkey Island is coming back, and now another beautiful-looking adventure game has been announced and subsequently landed on my Steam wishlist. It&#x27;s called Phonopolis, a political narrative title developed by Czech indie collective Amanita Design, best known for Machinarium, Botanicula, and Samorost.
In Phonopolis, players will take on the role of Felix, a young man living in a dystopian city that is threatened by the imminent rule of an authoritarian ruler. As Felix seems to be the only one who is aware of the looming danger of the situation, he tasks himself with stopping the leader and saving his fellow citizens.

As much as our eyes can glaze over when skimming through game publishers&#x27; financial reports, sometimes, there are head-turning tidbits about upcoming games we&#x27;d actually like to play. In this case, it sure seems like Thunderful has big plans for the wider SteamWorld series — four new games are in the works, including SteamWorld Headhunter, a body-swapping robot cowboy adventure we learned about last year.
According to the Thunderful Group&#x27;s report for January through March 2022 (via IGN), SteamWorld Headhunter is on deck for 2023, and there are three other titles on the way:
A SteamWorld puzzle game codenamed &quot;Strawberry&quot; (2023) (Mobile)
A SteamWorld city-builder codenamed &quot;Coffee&quot; (2023) (PC and Console)

With over two million copies sold, the role-playing game GreedFall is getting a sequel. Spiders and Nacon are circling back for GreedFall 2, a prequel set three years before the rough but charming original game, and it&#x27;s launching for PC and consoles in 2024.

Today&#x27;s announcement trailer sets the mood (and I fear for those hounds), but there&#x27;s also a more detailed summary of what to expect from GreedFall 2. It&#x27;s a POV swap.
&quot;This time you play as a native of Teer Fradee, uprooted by force from your island and taken to the continent of Gacane, where the colonists are from.&quot;

Wrapped up in that idea that they&#x27;re all pulled from a mysterious alien games console, CosmOS 9 packs nine games that are each meant to take 30-90 minutes. I&#x27;ve played a few and they seemed puzzle game staples, having me drawing paths through blocks, figure out how a mysterious computer interface worked, and such. See the breadth of the cosmic puzzling experience in the trailer below.

I&#x27;d launch Windows 3.1 just to watch screensavers, marvelling at Mystify and staring at Starfield. How wonderful that our computer needed to dream as preventative medicine! I relived this today with a new collection of customisable 3D screensavers, watching shoals of fish, taking a road trip through a museum of global electricity pylons, watching housing estates rise and fall, and seeing so many swirly colours.

                              <span>After some of the stuff we talked about in last week&#x27;s episode, I decided to take us further down the giggle chute to talk about funny games in general. What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they&#x27;re not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?
Because of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying &#x27;egg&#x27; a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew&#x27;s life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

Bonfire Peaks is a game about setting your belongings on fire. On purpose. In order to progress through its increasingly difficult puzzle levels, you&#x27;ll have to stack, balance, and eventually burn crates, which sounds much easier than it actually is.
You may not have heard of Bonfire Peaks, but if you&#x27;re a puzzle fan, you might want to check it out — it even made EDGE Magazine&#x27;s end-of-year top ten games for 2021, which is quite the honour. Also, it&#x27;s getting DLC, which will add a trilogy of new content, released in chapters, as announced on today&#x27;s Draknek Direct, a puzzle-focused Nintendo Direct-style livestream. Chapter One will be arriving in Q3 2022, which is around Autumn-ish.

Late last year Nintendo&#x27;s Indie World showcase included a look at the publishing debut of DONTNOD Entertainment, Gerda: A Flame in Winter, which is being developed by Danish studio PortaPlay. DONTNOD is well known for the first two Life is Strange games and Tell Me Why on Xbox, so unsurprisingly it&#x27;s working with a team focused on a narrative experience. It&#x27;s coming to Steam and Switch, making it a console exclusive for Nintendo&#x27;s system, and it now has a release date: 1st September.
As a reminder it&#x27;s described as a &#x27;narrative RPG-lite&#x27;, and it has a rather pleasant art style as well. Below is part of the official description to give you a sense of what to expect:

Now, Strictly Limited Games has announced that it will be releasing physical versions of Breakers Collection to sweeten the deal and make the wait worth it.

                              <span>New monsters also on the way in post-game content.
The Switch has some interesting monster catching games that aren&#x27;t Pokémon, and over the past couple of years that has included Nexomon and Nexomon: Extinction on the eShop. They&#x27;re particularly colourful games with their own sense of style, and have undoubtedly earned loyal fans - as a result publisher PQube has confirmed that Nexomon + Nexomon: Extinction: Complete Collection will arrive on Switch both physically and on the eShop later this year.
In terms of the benefits of jumping into the collection, one is that both games will be together in the same launcher, so hopping between the games will be easy. The publisher is also teasing &quot;new, extremely rare Nexomon in Nexomon’s upcoming post game content&quot;, which will be available in this collection. Some of the artwork and descriptions are below:

Super UFO Fighter, a game that kind of, sort of looks like Part Time UFO, is landing on Switch on July 14th, courtesy of publisher Phoenixx and developer VV_LABO. The game is a party action title that supports two player local and online multiplayer, with cross-play support added in for players on Switch and Steam.

We&#x27;re back to our regularly scheduled weekly Japanese charts after last week&#x27;s report gave us two weeks&#x27; worth of sales. But there are no real surprises as Nintendo Switch Sports continues to dominate. It sold over three times as many copies over the period of 9th to 15th May as its closest competitor, Japanese favourite Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
The only new entry this week is Square Enix&#x27;s FMV adventure The Centennial Case: A Shijima Story. In fact, the Switch version is the only version to chart, selling 6,409 copies on the hybrid console.

                              <span>Snow thank you.
Don’t you think a gaming hero should have a sort of heroic name? Rastan! Sparkster! Astyanax! Right? Yet here we are with the Snow Bros, Nick and Tom. Nicholas Snow and Thomas Snow. Not bad names – we can foresee a gritty murder mystery series starring one Thomas Snow coming to ITV in the near future – but not names that inspire enormous confidence in their capability. Nor should they, because the Snow Bros are a bit rubbish. The friendly local Twin Princesses get abducted, while Nick and Tom get turned into snowmen. And not even the flying kind who take you to see Santa then melt away while leaving behind a scarf in a skillfully produced allegory for grief. But we digress.
Toaplan&#x27;s Snow Bros. is basically a take on Bubble Bobble, really, but the difference is that Bub and Bob&#x27;s inaugural appearance is a masterpiece, and Snow Bros. is a weak imitation. The game surely has a cult following and prices on the secondhand market are sky-high, but it&#x27;s just not that fun to play. Movement and jumping feel floaty and weird. Everything is sort of grotesque-looking, but not in that Binding of Isaac gross-cute kind of way. You walk around freezing enemies. You collect various items for points. There&#x27;s very little to it and its appeal seems to extend only to its fans. A Snow Bros. fan, can you imagine?

Announced during the Guerlilla Collective Showcase last summer, Indonesian developer GameChanger Studio&#x27;s upcoming dating sim, My Lovely Wife, now has a release date! But this is a morbid romance game with a difference.
The game is a spiritual successor to My Lovely Daughter, which is an alchemy sim that tests your resolve — how far will you go to resurrect your dead daughter? To do this, you had to use alchemy to create homunculi, raise them as if they were your own kids, then murder them. That&#x27;s just delightful, isn&#x27;t it? And the father in question is a man called Faust, which just bodes extremely well considering the origins of the name.

                              <span>A gorgeous, Ghibli-style sim
I&#x27;m always chasing the high of my first playthrough of Stardew Valley. It&#x27;s among my favorite games of all time, and something comforting I reach for during tough times, so having other titles to add to that arsenal is always a plus. We could always use more Stardew-likes. That&#x27;s not a saying yet, but it needs to be. It would make looking for new games a whole lot easier. For now, though, I have seen one new game on the horizon that will satisfy my need for a cozy life sim: Spirittea.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Hi4GmC4v6sI
The logline for Spirittea is Stardew Valley meets Spirited Away, which alone is enough to make me buy this game.
In this upcoming PC game, you&#x27;ll play as a character who arrives in a beautiful rural town, where you meet NPCs to befriend and can partake in lots of hobbies like bug catching or karaoke — but then, of course, you accidentally drink from a cup of tea that allows you to see the spirit world! With the help of a friendly cat, you&#x27;re also tasked with helping to run the local bathhouse, helping soothe its ghostly patrons rather than them haunting others. Good thing I have some time to prepare before Spirittea comes out, because if I had access to this game right now, I&#x27;m pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t see the sun for a good while there.
Spirittea is coming to us from developer Cheesemaster Games, and is published by No More Robots, who are best known for publishing titles like Hypno Space Outlaw and Descenders. Like ConcernedApe (aka Eric Barone), the beloved developer behind Stardew Valley, Cheesemaster is actually just one guy, Dan Beckerton. Like Barone, Beckerton is extremely passionate about his project, and has spent a great deal of time working on it.
I personally can&#x27;t wait to check out all of the amazing work that he&#x27;s put in, so I&#x27;ll be looking forward to Spirittea&#x27;s release, whenever that will be.

                              <span>Just Redo It
Japanese studio Historia has announced that it is bringing its strange and sinister sci-fi sequel The Caligula Effect 2 to PC next month. Already available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, the &quot;Academy Juvenile RPG&quot; will be available to purchase via Steam and the Epic Games Store from June 23.

For those less inclined, The Caligula Effect 2 is the follow-up to the 2016 PS Vita original, and details the exploits of a party of fresh-faced teens known as &quot;The Go-Home Club.&quot; These kids are trapped within the unnervingly idyllic walls of &quot;Redo&quot; an alternate universe where all of your regrets are undone, your mistakes rectified, and your high school years played out in perpetuity, sans any end-of-day bell.
Explore the &quot;perfect world&quot; of Redo, befriend your fellow denizens, learn of their true selves and pasts, and you&#x27;ll soon begin to understand why it&#x27;s the flaws, mistakes, and errors of judgment that, ultimately, make us who we truly are.
On PlayStation and Switch, The Caligula Effect 2 launched to mixed reviews, (airing mostly on the positive side). While many critics and players enjoyed the sequel&#x27;s premise, combat, world, and cast of characters, some found that the sequel fell into the typical JRPG pitfalls of featuring too much narrative padding and an emphasis on The Grind in regards to its dungeon crawling.
The Caligula Effect 2 launches June 23 on PC (via Steam and EGS). It is available now on PS4 and Switch.

                              <span>Physical edition coming from Limited Run Games
We are exactly two months out from the launch of the dynamic Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, which is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. Japanese outfit Inti Creates has revealed some new tidbits regarding the action-packed sequel, ahead of its anticipated launch on July 28.
First and foremost, it is to be noted that this second mainline sequel will see the Azure Striker Gunvolt series receive a fully scripted English voiceover for the first time in series history. Popular voice actors Sean Chiplock, Kelly Baskin, and Ryan Colt Levy will step into the metallic shoes of Gunvolt, Kirin, and Black Badge respectively, while singer Diana Garnet will portray overseer Lumen, aka &quot;The Muse.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;heDpzWIqo54
Inti Creates also offered a first look at the sequel&#x27;s unique &quot;Story Mode+&quot; option, which will see the entire gameplay out in real-time, seamlessly posting plot details and dialogue directly into the action, without the need for pausing, cutscenes, or any other interruptions. This mode will surely be popular among budding speedrunners, while delivering a non-stop take on the sci-fi action for all other players.
Finally, Limited Run Games revealed that it has opened pre-orders on physical editions of Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 for Nintendo Switch. PhysEd fans can bag themselves a standard boxed copy of the title for $39.99 USD, or splash out on the Collector&#x27;s Edition, which includes an official art book, double CD soundtrack, and a cute &quot;Dogvolt&quot; keychain for $79.99. Both editions are available to pre-order now from the Limited Run Games store.
Oh, and speaking of soundtracks, be sure to check out the music video below, featuring the Japanese voice of Lumen, Megu Sakuragawa, performing one of the sequel&#x27;s many compositions &quot;Traces.&quot;

                              <span>The first premium membership skin is underwhelming at best
The Pokemon Unite membership program is now live, and sadly, it wasn&#x27;t really tweaked from its original leaked incarnation.
Now live worldwide, the Pokemon Unite membership program (called the &quot;Unite Club&quot;) costs $9.99 per month, which is a rather large disconnect compared to what other subscriptions offer. Here&#x27;s what you get:
A &quot;first time membership benefit&quot; of a trainer outfit
40 gems a day (more on that later)
One premium skin a month (more on that in a moment)
Additional unite licenses each week (read: a few more &quot;free rotation&quot; characters, which is useless if you own them all)
Trial Holowear (skins) each week
Special portrait frames and speech bubbles
10% off new fashion items
Don&#x27;t all cheer at once!
Naturally, these sorts of programs (like a similar one for Fortnite) come with a marquee monthly skin. And really, this is one of the most front-facing disappointing aspects of the Pokemon Unite membership. Like many Unite skins, this Greedent Holowear outfit can barely be considered a tweak from the original model.
Also, note this proviso: &quot;you will receive 40 Aeos gems daily as a login bonus.&quot; Digging into the FAQ, it&#x27;s important to note that even the membership program is a method of getting you to log in every day: &quot;If you log in and forget to claim the bonus or if the bonus resets without you logging in, you will not be able to receive Aeos gems for the missed day.&quot; The Fortnite membership service by comparison provides the equivalent of $10 worth of V-Bucks no questions asked, on a monthly basis (that isn&#x27;t drip-fed).
One more caveat to keep in mind: &quot;Club membership benefits can only be received on the platform used to join.&quot;
You can find a full FAQ on the membership here, if you are planning on getting it.

The &quot;Destroy the Server&quot; event is a one-day open beta set to take place on Saturday, May 28. Interested psychopaths can dive into the weird and violent world of futuristic game show Death Jamboree, battling it out with a variety of post-apocalyptic contestants, all under the watchful and highly excitable eyes of hosts Queen B and Bryan Zemeckis. Check out Deathverse&#x27;s wild world in the gameplay trailer below.

Set in 2026, as the planet rises from the aftermath of global conflict, Deathverse: Let it Die sees a populace seeking to quench its bloodlust through Death Jamboree&#x27;s consistent delivery of extreme violence. The show&#x27;s contestants — each sporting unique looks, skills, and abilities — utilize sci-fi weaponry, ethereal powers, and sometimes just good, old-fashioned right hooks in order to mash the opposition and take their place among the pantheon of Death Jamboree champions.
If you fancy your chances against a roster of retro-future warriors in the kill-or-be-killed world of Death Jamboree, then all you need do is pre-load the Deathverse: Let it Die module on either PS4 or PS5 ahead of the server&#x27;s launch, and you&#x27;ll be good to go. The chaos kicks off on May 28 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST until 19:00 PT / 22:00 ET / 03:00 BST. Of course, as the beta is designed specifically to stress test the servers, it may be host to various bugs and outages. A further test will be held on June 5.
Deathverse: Let it Die is scheduled to launch on PlayStation later in 2022.

                              <span>Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.
The game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.


Like the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. 
The studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. 
The first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.</span>

                              <span>It took more than 10 years, but Shinji Mikami says his original vision for Tango Gameworks is finally coming to life.
Mikami established Tango in 2010 after nearly two decades at Capcom, directing games like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 4, and a few years contracting for Platinum Games, where he directed Vanquish. His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.
“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry. When you’re in your 30s, you have the right balance – you’re energetic and have your ego a…</span>

                              <span>Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: 
New Game Announcement!

May 18, 2022
As you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. 
Elsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. 
In the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think.

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.
Along with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.
If you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures. Overwatch&#x27;s Junkrat and D.Va, Bayonetta, and Hades&#x27; Zagreus are just a few of them that you can grab. You can find more about Aloy at Good Smiles&#x27; official site.

                              <span>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. 
The long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: 
“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” 
To soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. 
Nacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.&quot; You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. 
Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012&#x27;s Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. 
2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft’s roller derby-inspired Roller Champions finally has a release date, and its inaugural season is only a week away.
On May 25, the free-to-play multiplayer title goes live. The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. 


As players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. 
Roller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. 
Roller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

coverage here.

As the title implies, I am not somebody who has ever really cared all that much about the Warcraft series or its MMO counterpart, World of Warcraft. I have memories of playing one of the Warcraft games back on a PC circa 2003, so it was probably Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, but I never really followed the franchise beyond that. All of this is to set up and say that if you’re looking for what a hardcore Warcraft fan thinks of the series’ first venture into the mobile space in Warcraft Arclight Rumble, I’m not your guy. 
However, as someone who doesn’t care about Warcraft ... I’m really enjoying Warcraft Arclight Rumble. I can only speak on the gameplay to…</span>

Escape Rooms have become all the rage over the last decade, but the pandemic has put a damper on the in-person experience. Escape Academy brings the concept home, expanding the concept into a broader adventure set in an unusual university. 
You control a new student enrolled at a school dedicated to training escape artists. Nearly every room, floor, or corridor of this institution hides a puzzle or three, and very little is what meets the eye. The same extends to the eclectic faculty, including a mysterious headmaster. The first-person game tasks you …</span>

We had the pleasure of having the upcoming reboot of Saints Row on the cover of Game Informer issue #340 when I went hands-on with an early build of the game and spoke with the fine folks at Volition, the studio behind the series. Last week, the developer held a preview event, showing off where Saints Row is now, just a few months before launch. Much of what was shown was the same content as last year, but there were plenty of changes I noticed that have me feeling good about the direction this new Saints adventure is taking.

                              <span>The first episode of Pokémon: Huisian Snow, a new limited web Pokémon series, is now live on YouTube.
It’s less than seven minutes long so it’s worth a watch for anyone who likes Pokémon, but it’s especially a must-watch for fans of this year’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus. That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, &quot;Onto the Icy Blue.&quot;
“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” 


We won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. 
After watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game. Check out the three starters for the next generation of Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after that.

Vampires secretly walk among us. They drive fast cars. Lord above us in penthouses. And are so refined in their tastes, they bite our wrists gently when feeding, hopefully keeping us alive for future snacks. Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong explores the nightwalkers&#x27; place in our world through a nicely designed narrative lens that embraces player choice in deep and satisfying ways.
Within the opening seconds of play, we learn that the vampires&#x27; Boston Camarilla is on high alert; trouble arising moments after crownin…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that Square Enix has news to share in regards to the Final Fantasy VII franchise next month. 
Nomura said this in a Japanese live stream about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. 
The last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. 
All of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. 
While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that.

                              <span>Disney has unveiled the first trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the upcoming Marvel series that premieres on Disney+ this August.
Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer juggling an increasingly chaotic life, including working for a newly launched superhuman law division. Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). 


You can also check out the official poster below:
She-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. 
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June.

Three of them are aiming for release next year.

I will now begrudgingly admit that Sonic Boom is alright, and the first Sonic live action movie is better than expected. 

So here I am, looking at the new footage of Sonic Origins, which collects and remasters the blue hedgehog&#x27;s original platform games.

                              <span>Game Pass is particularly ideal for two kinds of games: indie games you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like enough to commit to the upfront cost, and decent-not-great blockbusters you know almost certainly aren&#x27;t worth the cost but would quite like to play for at least a bit.

There are plenty of games that fit into both of these categories joining the subscription service before the end of May, including Vampire Survivors, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Sniper Elite 5 and Jurassic World Evolution 2.

Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy VII Remake director, has said that &quot;various&quot; announcements are coming next month related to Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Will it be news about the second part of the FF7 Remake - or will it be, I dunno, a livestreamed concert and some phone wallpapers?

                              <span>If Intel’s recent takeover of the RPS best gaming CPUs guide wasn’t indication enough, their latest 12th Gen Alder Lake chips are the real deal – especially on pure games performance. This should make the newly launched Core i9-12900KS, in a way, the realest deal of all: it’s structurally identical to the Core i9-12900K, originally the top-spec CPU in the series, but made with an even more discerning binning process. A component of the highest quality components, if you will, and as such can brush past the Core i9-12900K’s maximum boost clock speed of 5.2GHz to reach a scorching 5.5GHz.

It&#x27;s currently going for $1799, a $601 drop from its MSRP of $2400. That&#x27;s still a lot of money, but it&#x27;s a great deal on a flagship-grade gaming laptop.

                              <span>Video games are arguably the only form of entertainment you need these days, but hey, who doesn&#x27;t like an extra bit of pop culture on the old tellybox now and then, eh? Maybe you&#x27;re actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship&#x27;s load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

The game&#x27;s first PvP beta drew to a close today, but we should find out what&#x27;s next for the hero shooter at next month&#x27;s event. The blog post doesn&#x27;t give much away, all told, but according to the game&#x27;s official Twitter account the event will include more details about its next PvP beta. Fingers crossed for an invite this time.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that little inconsequential choices are better than controlling a turret. I am pleased that quite a few people did actually pick turrets. But this week, in the name of experimentation, I&#x27;m trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can&#x27;t imagine many will think this good, let&#x27;s give it a go, for science. Tell me, what&#x27;s better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

                              <span>Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like &quot;Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,&quot; and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly&#x27;s wing, indeed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we&#x27;ve heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you&#x27;d expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It&#x27;s a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like &quot;cops&quot;, &quot;switch car&quot; and &quot;plan&quot;, leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can&#x27;t think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

                              <span>3D gaming is… well, if not dead, then at best being kept in an iron lung by a teensy niche of enthusiasts. However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

                              <span>From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren&#x27;t exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn&#x27;t an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

                              <span>Czech indie collective Amanita Design have revealed their next adventure game, the dystopian Phonopolis. In a handful of firsts for the collective, Phonopolis will not only be their first game with 3D graphics, but it&#x27;s also going to be the first that has actual narration rather than fun, nonsense noises. There&#x27;s no release date just yet, but have a watch of the teaser trailer below. It looks a real treat.

Proto jsme se vzdali tradičního termínu, který býval první víkend v listopadu, píše Jozef „JoeJoe“ Mlích na webu akce. Místo toho proběhně konference už 17. a 18. září 2022. Místo se ovšem nemění, OpenAlt proběhne v tradičních prostorách Fakulty Informačních Technologií VUT v Brně.</span>

Poté se začalo hovořit o tom, že firma připravuje zvláštní nabídku pro osobní použití a nakonec se z ní vyklubala omezená varianta Workspace Essentials Starter bez GMailu. Řadě uživatelů se ale tato varianta nelíbila, proto migrovali na jiná řešení.</span>

Among the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself.

                              <span>The RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 Ti are both available at their UK RRP right now at Scan, thanks to Nvidia Founders Edition models remaining in stock. This makes it a great time to pick up either model, as the Founders Edition cards perform excellently yet have much lower recommended retail prices than third-party models which can cost hundreds of pounds more.

                              <span>Look at V Rising&#x27;s Steam store page and you&#x27;d wave it off in a heartbeat. Middling art sits atop a generic description that does its very best to not sell the game. &quot;Hunt for blood in nearby settlements... conquer the land of the living.&quot; Alrighteyyy, then. Screenshots show what could be any other isometric RPG like Path Of Exile or something – anything.
So, you dive in expecting an average time. One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you&#x27;ve closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no! V Rising is the opposite of average; it should be renamed V-ERY GOOD Rising. Forget the art, the description, the screenshots. Just give it a shot.

                              <span>I’ve always been terrible at games. Truly. Trying to join in with any online multiplayer game has been met with quotes such as, &quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; and, &quot;Wow, 84 deaths? Really?&quot;, to name but a few. This led to scenarios where it felt far easier for me to give up and try something new. But when the point of the game is to continue dying over and over again to up my knowledge, skill level, abilities and unlock new weapons and perks? There I have found a place for my unending death and incompetence in Supergiant&#x27;s Hades.

However, this will also coincide with the game being delisted from Steam. From that point on, Fall Guys will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, although it will still remain playable for existing owners on Steam without them having to move to Epic&#x27;s launcher. The news came as part of Mediatonic’s announcement that Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox next month with full cross-play and cross-progression support, alongside its current homes on PC and PlayStation.

However, people who use these streaming sites to consume pirated content may not be copyright infringers. Law professor James Gibson explains why.

                              <span>Today’s reveal of Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim has unsurprisingly and understandably elicited a mixture of surprise, confusion, and flat-out ridicule. I won’t tell anyone that either emotion is invalid, but I do take exception to the sentiment that established franchises should stay in their lane and aren’t allowed to stretch their wings to other genres. After all, several of the best games and even series were spawned when their creators flexed an IP’s versatility. So before you write off a Dead by Daylight visual novel, here are just a few examples – not a definitive list or ranking – of other wild spin-offs that became big success stories in their own right.

                              <span>Today’s Dead by Daylight 6th Anniversary livestream brought a lot of exciting announcements, but none were stranger or more surprising than the reveal of Hooked on You. This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.
If you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. 


“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”
Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.</span>

Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate brings D&amp;D flavor back to Magic: The Gathering in a fully draftable set focused on the Commander format.
Like the previous Adventures in the Forgotten Realms set from last summer, Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate let&#x27;s Magic players step foot into the existing role-playing world of Forgotten Realms, but with a tighter focus on the settlement of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. The set takes inspiration from the D&amp;D rulebooks and adventures and uses locations and characters from Bioware&#x27;s classic Baldur&#x27;s Gate video games and Larian Studio&#x27;s upcoming Baldur&#x27;s Gate III.

People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5&#x27;s power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.

The sting of another death fades as I attempt to shake off my nerves. I’m preparing to clash with a Sanguimancer I’ve tried to slay a dozen times. Maybe I’ll learn something new as I dash back into the fray, though I’ve been down this path many times on prior hunts, and I know I’m more likely to survive on sheer luck than anything else. Salt and Sacrifice often leaves me lacking a feeling of accomplishment and, in the process, sullies the promising additions like its bounties and crafting systems.
After choosing a class from a handful of options and customizing my gloomy mar…</span>

Featuring luscious greenery, ancient ruins, and plenty of beautiful waterfalls, it seems this fantasy RPG will be quite the looker if the concept art is any indication. Techland released the concept art below as a way to let developers know that the studio is hiring and that dozens of positions are open for work on this RPG.

                              <span>A blog post on the official Epic Games website announced that the incoming v20.40 update allows V-bucks purchased on PlayStation to be accessed across all viable platforms. This correlates with Fortnite&#x27;s Shared Wallet system, which is currently available on Xbox, PC, Android, and cloud gaming services. 
For this to work, players need to confirm that their PlayStation account is linked to their Epic Games account. And for anyone who&#x27;s not currently using Fortnite Wallet but is interested in it, you&#x27;ll need to follow the step above and link your platform&#x27;s account to Epic. Sadly, the Shared Wallet feature is still unavailable on Switch, so V-Bucks acquired on other platforms can&#x27;t be transferred to Nintendo’s beloved handheld. 
V-Bucks are earned from the Battle Pass, Quest Packs, or Save the World game mode. Click the link above for the Fortnite Wallet FAQ and any additional information.
In other Fortnite news, Robocop, Scarlet Witch, and Maria &quot;Chica&quot; Lopez have all joined the battle royale fray this month.</span>

The event revealed three new games and a quick look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising. 
It began with Among The Trolls, a new folklore survival game, then Stray Blade, a magic combat action RPG, and then a look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising, which was released last week, before ending with a quick tease of a game called Miasma Chronicles, developed by Mutant Year Zero developer The Bearded Ladies.
Let’s break each of the new games down: 
Among The Trolls
The trailer for Among The Trolls sets up this survival game as somewhat spooky, or at least mysterious. Your goal is to survive in a forest that’s home to creatures…</span>

                              <span>Things are ramping up for Take-Two Interactive as a new financial report details the publisher&#x27;s IP plans for the next three years. According to Nintendo Life, many projects are in the works, from those already announced to undisclosed titles. Ultimately, the report revealed over 30 games are in the works, including, but not limited to, new ports and remasters. 
The full report, which can be read here, categorizes the upcoming games and provides clear definitions for each:
Immersive Core: Titles that have the deepest gameplay and the most hours of content. Examples include our key sports franchises (like PGA 2K and NBA 2K) as well as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption (to name a few). 
Independent: Externally developed Private Division releases. 
Mobile: Any title released on a mobile platform.
Mid-core: Titles that are either an arcade title (like WWE Battlegrounds) or games that have many hours of gameplay, but not to the same extent as an immersive core title. 
New iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.
Moreover, a pipeline table in the document states Take-Two is developing 24 immersive core games, including The Quarry for June 10, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns later this year, Kerbal Space Program 2 (PC) in early 2023, and NBA2K23, PGA Tour 2K23, and WWE 2K23 next year. Ten independent games, 20 mobile games like the GTA Trilogy in 2023, 7 mid-core games, including the long-awaited Tales from the Borderlands sequel, and eight new iterations of prior releases are also on the way. Fans of Take-Two&#x27;s many development studios undoubtedly have a lot to look forward to. 
It&#x27;s hard to guess the future for some of these categories, but what ports and remasters are you anticipating? Perhaps we&#x27;ll get to play a modernized Bully port! Let us know what you&#x27;re positing in the comments below!

On April 16, an FFXIV maintenance update indicated that the latest lottery cycle for housing in-game was broken, so when checking the placard where winners were to be shown, the placard said there were no winners. This meant nobody could obtain a house. Polygon reports the issue has been fixed as of yesterday, and now, winning lottery numbers will be displayed correctly, and land purchases may be finalized accordingly. 
“As I mentioned in our previous update, we will be conducting maintenance to restore lottery results data on Monday, May 16,” FFXIV producer and director Naoki Yoshida writes in a new update. “This maintenance will fix identified errors and properly relay lottery results for affected plot…</span>

Summed up, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising is a simple and straightforward action/RPG. It’s easy to get lost in its tranquil cycle of collecting stamps via fetch quests and combat. However, Rising doesn’t have much substance. The whole experience is bland and commits various RPG transgressions, which is disappointing. Especially as it’s a prequel introducing the Eiyuden world ahead of Eiyuden Chronicle: A Hundred Heroes – a spiritual successor to the Suikoden series. If this is a sign of what’s to come, I’m concerned.
Rising’s protagonist, CJ, is…</span>

                              <span>Kerbal Space Program 2 will remain grounded a while longer. Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.
Creative director Nate Simpson explained on the project&#x27;s forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: 
“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” 


Like its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. 
Kerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.
Unfortunately, Kerbal isn&#x27;t the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a big couple of weeks for MultiVersus, with the announcement of a big Evo tournament a few days ago, the first gameplay demonstration along with that announcement, and the game goes into a new round of closed alpha testing this week. But the news for Warner Bros.&#x27; brawler doesn&#x27;t stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.
Looney Toons&#x27; Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo&#x27;s Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week&#x27;s alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won&#x27;t make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.
A later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you&#x27;re not able to get into the closed alpha, you&#x27;ll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. 
If you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game&#x27;s website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.</span>

                              <span>While I haven’t been able to keep up with the confident viewing pace that some of my colleagues have, my longtime enthusiasm for the franchise couldn’t keep me away from viewing the new Halo TV series. Each episode leaves me increasingly perplexed as I’ve watched from week to week. I’m a longtime Halo player, a fervent sci-fi fan, and a dedicated gamer; I should be the target audience for this long-awaited adaptation. And all the pieces feel like they are in place for a good time. The meticulously reproduced versions of Covenant and UNSC weapons and ships, the overwhelming power of a Spartan on the battlefield, and the semi-mystical nature of ancient artifacts related to the Halo – these are all the sorts of things fans should want, right? And yet, as each episode comes to a close, I’m lef…</span>

                              <span>Fall Guys, the popular obstacle course-based multiplayer game, is going free-to-play on June 21. 
Mediatonic, the developer behind Fall Guys, announced this today in a special livestream for the game. June 21 will also see the launch of Season 1 and Fall Guys&#x27; long-awaited arrival to Xbox platforms, Switch, and the Epic Games Store. 


In fact, to prepare for this shift to free-to-play, Mediatonic says PS4 players will need to download a new version of the game that’s available now. All of your existing cosmetics and crowns will transfer over. When the Xbox version of the game goes live, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will gain access to the first of three cosmetics they’ll get as Ultimate Perks. The second cosmetic will drop in the second month, and the third in the third month.

                              <span>This morning, PlayStation revealed a new look at the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup and it has me quite excited. The first-party PS5 and PS4 lineup looks great, even if we likely will never get first-party games day-and-date on PS Plus a la Xbox Game Pass. I’m especially excited to see newer titles like Death Stranding Director’s Cut, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on the list because it means that yes, while we won’t be getting big releases immediately on PS Plus, we might not have to wait too long for them to hit the subscription service. 
The third-party lineup isn’t nearly as exciting but it does include some bangers like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Control: Ultimate Edition, and Red Dead Redemption 2. I’m less worried about …</span>

Robocop was actually added to the game over this past weekend, and it even includes the leg of his defeated rival, ED-209. Plus, you can ride on a mini ED-209 using a new Robocop Emote now in the game. 
“The Robocop Outfit includes the LEG-209 Back Bling, the leg of ED-209 that’s separately available as a Pickaxe,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “Get them both in the Robocop Bundle and use LEG-209 as a Pickaxe that can be a Back Bling and vice versa.

                              <span>Is Elden Ring&#x27;s merciless combat giving you trouble? That&#x27;s alright, we&#x27;ve all been there. If you&#x27;re a PC player, good thing the modding community is particularly generous with its wacky experiments. PC Gamer reports that a new mod allows Tarnished to group up with some of their favorite NPCs and bosses so that The Lands Between is a little easier and less lonely to navigate. 
SPOILERS FOR NPC &amp; BOSS NAMES/PHASES BELOW
Satoshi98 is the modder behind this cool pseudo-party system. The new feature is kind of like spirit summoning. As PC Gamer aptly points out, it&#x27;s akin to Skyrim&#x27;s follower mechanic, meaning that your party members will likely stay with you even after defeating the big bads of a specific point of interest. Moreover, the various characters were rebalanced to fit Elden Ring&#x27;s exploratory loop and include, Melina, Sellen, Millicent, Ranni, Blaidd, Malenia (and her Rot form!), Radagon, Morgott, Godfrey, and Maliketh among many others. You can purchase these followers from Miriel at the Church of Vows. 
Head here to see what else Satoshi98&#x27;s mod entails and be sure to read about why I think From Software&#x27;s Next Game Should Prioritize Coop.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a new superhero title, initially slated for a March 2022 release until it was delayed until the second half of the year. Firaxis, the team behind the classic strategy franchise, XCOM, is helming the project. Midnight Suns was our cover game last summer and looks to tell a darker story within the Marvel universe while also mixing Firaxis&#x27; turn-based strategy mechanics with deck building. According to Push Square, a Korean games listing revealed the Midnight Suns&#x27; rating, meaning a release date might be on the horizon.
Push Square posits that we might get more Midnight Suns news during this year&#x27;s Summer Games Fest. And since we&#x27;re coming up to the second half of 2022, this might not be misguided speculation. You can click here to see the game&#x27;s rating for yourself. Hopefully, this means we won&#x27;t be seeing another delay.
Marvel’s Midnight Suns chronicles the exploits of a powerful sorceress named Lilith, who unleashes an army of demons upon the world.  The Midnight Suns, a group of several fan-favorite heroes, including Wolverine, Blade, Iron Man, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider, led by you, The Hunter, must join forces and thwart Lilith&#x27;s plans.
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is slated for a 2022 release and will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>I am extremely bad at card games, despite the fact that meeting up and playing poker at a friend&#x27;s house was one of the main entertainments on offer when I was a teenager (because one guy had a full chip set, for some reason). I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that&#x27;ll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. 
Instead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I&#x27;m very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.

A free demo is out now, and I&#x27;m enjoying it.

Conducted by Japanese gaming mag Famitsu and translated by FrontlineJP, the survey also reveals our favourite bosses, items, areas and loads more. In addition to Ranni, it also turns out players were very fond of the living jar Iron Fist Alexander, while their favourite enemy was the demigod Starscourge Radahn.

While the site returned, it never reached its old highs again and staffers lost their motivation along the way.

Nový Fedora Linux byl vydán sice se zpožděním, ale přeci. Red Hat aktualizoval Enterprise Linux 8 a alternativní sestavení následují. Mezi to vše se vešla vydání IPFire, KaOS nebo Proxmox Virtual Environment… a na závěr letmý pohled na ruský ALT Linux.</span>

                              <span>One year ago, The Pirate Bay released its very own &#x27;crypto&#x27; token out of the blue. There was no official whitepaper for this soft launch, but the torrent site envisioned the &#x27;coin&#x27; being used to access VIP content or donate to uploaders. Thus far, nothing has come of it. People don&#x27;t seem interested in the &#x27;project&#x27; and the price continues to drop.

While those images and videos don&#x27;t appear to be falling to copyright complaints, a particular YouTube video posted in April has attracted direct interest from Riot Games&#x27; legal team, and a DMCA subpoena to unmask the uploader.

It&#x27;s about a cute crab battling other crabs at the bottom of a colourful sea, sure, but the different shells and the weapons you and your enemies are wielding are made from trash dumping into that colourful sea by humans.

It&#x27;s still cute, though. There&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Activision Blizzard published a post on their website about their &quot;Diversity Space Tool&quot;. Developed by subsidiary King, it&#x27;s a tool for rating video game characters along certain axes in order to rate their relative diversity. Several people then pointed out that sounded mildly dystopian.

Yesterday, Activison Blizzard responded, saying that the &quot;prototype is not being used in active game development&quot;, and was designed as an optional supplement to other work.

                              <span>Happy Eurovision day, everyone! Today, musicians from across Europe and beyond come together to give it their all, with varying degrees of catchiness, camp, and drama. Honestly, this year&#x27;s contest better be amazing, considering some great songs have already been knocked out before the finals. I was particularly surprised by the loss of Austria&#x27;s pop goths and Latvia&#x27;s song with the most surprising obscene opening line in pop history. If that&#x27;s the quality of song being rejected, they BETTER NOT have any boring junk in the finals. But we have hours to fill until Eurovision starts, so what are you playing this weekend?

                              <span>PCIe 4.0 drives are coming down in price fast, and nowhere is this more evident than with Ebuyer&#x27;s recent sale on the WD Black SN770 2TB drive. It normally costs £190, but this has dropped to £170 today. That&#x27;s an awesome deal on a high speed PCIe 4.0 drive that works on both PC and PS5 and hits the current sweet spot for bulk storage.

                              <span>AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. 


The lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won&#x27;t need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.

This month, we&#x27;ve shifted our game preservation gaze to 2009, so read on below to find out which games made the cut, and which have been cast off into the eternal games bin.

Despite appearances, it&#x27;s quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren&#x27;t quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It&#x27;s a good time.

                              <span>“The fleet does the flying, the marines do the dying,” says CCP boss Hilmar Veigar Pétursson. “I love Starship Troopers.”
Pétursson is hardly the first person to profess an affection for Paul Verhoeven’s cult military satire. But he is one of the few with command of his own company of science fiction game developers. For well over half of Eve Online’s existence, he has led CCP in an effort to create the perfect spin-off shooter - stubbornly chasing the dream of a playable Starship Troopers, even as those brave young prototypes have been cut down by unimpressed players, one after the other.

                              <span>The Lego games I&#x27;m most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year&#x27;s extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder&#x27;s Journey, in that you&#x27;re exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it&#x27;s way more granular. You&#x27;re whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.
From playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it&#x27;s like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it&#x27;s sort of surprising that you can&#x27;t reach through the screen and pick it up. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.

I&#x27;m afraid it has been a while since we went into the exclusion zone to find an episode or two of The Nate Files, our extra supporter-only podcast. This is entirely my fault; I was incautious while we were in there and accidentally refracted into an eel, and then Nate nearly ate that eel - it was a whole thing*, but I&#x27;m right as rain now. That&#x27;s a-moray! Thank you for sticking with us while we got that admin sorted out. We really do appreciate your support so we can make these podcasts and do other fun things (like pay for my de-sliming). We couldn&#x27;t do it without you!

MiHoYo say this is “the last shelter for urban civilization due to the calamity”. So far, so mysterious.

Overlord aims to offer more control over your empires, both to let you shape them in more specific ways and also to generate more anecdotes when it all goes wrong.

As always, the expansion also releasing alongside a new free patch with balance fixes and bux fixes for all.

They followed through by releasing 4X strategy game Dune: Spice Wars last month, and now it seems they&#x27;re ramping up development on a new open world survival game set in the Dune universe.

                              <span>There&#x27;s presumably less pressure to keep every scrap of information secret when the game you&#x27;re developing is a remake. EA Motive seem to be taking advantage of that by releasing lots of behind-the-scenes, in-development videos and streams of their work on the Dead Space remake. Then, occasionally in those streams, they offer some news. Back in March, they let it be known during a deep dive into the remake&#x27;s audio that the game would release in early 2023. Now, during a livestream about the game&#x27;s art, they&#x27;ve announced the specific release date: January 27th, 2023.

                              <span>You could fairly think of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti as a big, stump-necked brute of a graphics card. What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”


But I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.

                              <span>Techland have announced that the first story DLC for their parkour-infused survival horror Dying Light 2: Stay Human will slip from its scheduled June launch date to September. The DLC is one of two planned paid story DLCs, with the second not targeted for any specific date outside of Techland’s promised five years of post-launch support for the game.

                              <span>We&#x27;re going macro this week, so we&#x27;re talking about the best writing in video games. This is a very broad topic for discussion, so that means I also get to say &#x27;ludonarrative dissonance&#x27; (we also describe &#x27;ludonarrative harmony&#x27; as its opposite). Please don&#x27;t let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.
The times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko!&quot; tweet and then just did a much worse version of it. Hang your head in shame, whoever you are. I also went to a first communion party and ate a lot of cake, and had a run in with a very charismatic toddler who may or may not be evil.

Bethesda&#x27;s RPG space epic was originally due to arrive on November 11th 2022, with Arkane Austin&#x27;s first-person vampire survival game Redfall arriving sometime this summer, but now both titles have been shifted back to an unknown time between Janauary and June next year.

                              <span>Leave the doormat outside long enough in Age Of Darkness: Final Stand and you might not live to see the morning. If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.


The game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them.

                              <span>John Romero, legendary developer and co-creator of PC classics Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein, has announced he’s writing an autobiography entitled &#x27;Doom Guy – Life In First-Person&#x27;. The book isn&#x27;t due to be published until early next year, but does this mean the Doom movie from 2005 starring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is technically Romero’s biopic? Did The Rock not want to wear a wig? I’m very confused.

While this is arguably a poor use of my time, I enjoy the process—and technically it is productive. But perhaps you, reader dear, might enjoy hearing about these small things, or at least find them interesting/weird. So let&#x27;s talk about the work which went into producing one (1) screenshot and 43 seconds of video for last week&#x27;s post about the Morrowind modder who added the family cat because their kids were afraid of mudcrabs.

This time, the big new feature is the ability to create per-game performance profiles, which let you pick and choose from the Deck’s toy chest of power and battery-saving settings and apply your tailored configuration to a specific game at a time. You can then switch between games without having to manually re-adjust those settings every time you play something different.

                              <span>Disney is looking for a senior paralegal to expand its anti-piracy team in Burbank California. The ideal candidate will join the Digital Media Antipiracy Group to monitor and respond to the latest piracy threats, including websites and apps. Over in the UK, Disney also hopes to add a new analyst to its anti-piracy force.

                              <span>The Italian telecoms regulator AGCOM already has tools at its disposal to fight piracy but legislation winding its way through the corridors of power will move things to a new level. In addition to making it easier for copyright holders to disable access to identified infringing content at the ISP level, similar powers will enable urgent and precautionary blocking even before an infringement takes place.

I feel I should&#x27;ve defined drawbacks more narrowly but there&#x27;ll be chaos if introduce undosies. Onwards! Next, I present a choice between two oft-disliked things.

                              <span>Loot River, the pixely roguelike with a bit of Souls and a bit of Tetris, is all about making multiple attempts to navigate weird dungeons made of moving platforms, before dying and starting again. It&#x27;s one of those games that&#x27;s perfect for Game Pass, at least in its current form, but that&#x27;s going to be changing in a small bit, according to a post devs Straka Studio made yesterday. Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn&#x27;t realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they&#x27;ve already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot?

Phew. We already knew the event was going to kick off on June 9th, but Keighley has now revealed that the bulk of the announcements will be done and dusted by Sunday June 12th. And breathe...

                              <span>Just a few days ago, the expected release of Songs Of Conquest turned into the expected release of Songs Of Conquest into early access. There are times when such a pivot might dramatically change the angle you&#x27;d need to review a game from.


This isn&#x27;t really one of those times, because I think I&#x27;d be recommending Songs Of Conquest overall as it is anyway. Giving it an estimated year for Lavapotion to &quot;figure out, together with the community, what features we should prioritize&quot; could well push me into a wholehearted endorsement, though.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve not played Call Of Duty: Warzone in yonks. It used to take up practically all of my time, and now it&#x27;s sat there neglected on my PC for the better part of a year or so. Even with King Kong and Godzilla arriving in the game today, I&#x27;m still playing Fortnite over it, which says it all, really.
Why did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I&#x27;d become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it&#x27;s changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there&#x27;s been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.

MiHoYo announced the delay on Twitter last week due to “project progress”, but promised to issue Travelers with complimentary goodies every week until the launch of update 2.7. They don’t clarify when that update will be though. More info is in the full statement on MiHoYo’s site.

As Kim Dotcom vows to keep fighting extradition, he says that he too should be given the same right. Of course, nothing is straightforward.

This will apply retroactively to major movie studios with Disney being a prime target. The plan appears to be an indirect attempt to punish Disney for its politics, including the opposition to Florida&#x27;s “Don’t Say Gay” law.
