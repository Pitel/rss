Good morning, Woke Moralists, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? They say a week is a long time in politics, and this week felt like the longest in history. I have zero issue talking topical in this here column, but it is a Saturday, it is the weekend, and we don&#x27;t have to waste this fine morning on blustery, mop-headed cretins and their insufferably lengthy downfall. I&#x27;d much rather talk about... I don&#x27;t know, Time Gal, or perhaps the fact that I have finally found ice cream that is both vegan and low-calorie! Food of the Gods, I&#x27;m telling ya.
I hope that your week has treated you and yours very kindly, and that the weekend offers you the opportunity for some rest, relaxation, and fine entertainment. And if you&#x27;re working today, know that we&#x27;ve …</span>

Welcome back! How was your week? Last Friday we finished up Fran Bow; tonight we’re finally able to test out MADiSON! This long-awaited horror game gives strong Visage vibes and apparently centers around an old camera. I’ve avoided all spoilers while waiting for today and might try playing with the lights off for the full effect.

See you tonight! Can&#x27;t wait!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

Final Fantasy VII Remake may stray from the original in some notable ways, but it also has a lot of love for its predecessor. One piece of evidence is the inclusion of Leviathan as one of the few summons that made it into Final Fantasy VII Remake.
Square Enix has been running a series of blog posts going over the remake&#x27;s development, with the latest posted today. And in response to a question about Final Fantasy VII Remake&#x27;s Summoning Materia, co-director Naoki Hamaguchi explains why Leviathan specifically made the cut.
&quot;At an early stage of development, we looked over the line-up of summons in the original FFVII and decided to go with Ifrit, Chocobo and Moogle, Shiva, Fat Chocobo, Leviathan and Bahamut, for a roster of 6,&quot; said Hamaguchi. &quot;The r…</span>

If you follow any account tangentially related to Final Fantasy or the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, you may have seen some recent ruckus about a billboard. Maybe about role-players, nightclubs, or a wall of cat-girls.
It&#x27;s been a heck of a few days in the world of Final Fantasy XIV. But for those who maybe don&#x27;t play, or aren&#x27;t so plugged into the community, we&#x27;ve put together an explainer of what is going on with that billboard.
Much ado about a billboard
As best we can track back, it starts with an event being held in-game by Rain Nightclub. Player housing in Final Fantasy XIV is very customizable, allowing players and Free Companies (XIV&#x27;s guilds) to design all kinds of cool locales. These range from simple homes to full-on aquariums and yes, nightclubs, where …</span>

                              <span>Wahoo! It&#x27;s the weekend!
It&#x27;s been a little bit milder here n the UK this week, but it looks like things are about to hot up again. The news has also been a bit steadier, too. Nintendo unveiled a brand new Splatoon 3-Themed Switch OLED earlier this week. The upcoming Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion will have some &quot;differences&quot; in resolution and frame rate on Switch. And there&#x27;s a new LEGO set coming, and it&#x27;s a big ol&#x27; Bowser that you can get into a fight with!
We&#x27;ve had a healthy dose of DLC reviews this week, too. Both Cuphead - The Delicious Last Course and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak blew us away. Some of us got together to create this weird hybrid console made up of aspects of every single Nintendo console. And we&#x27;ve played some Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and we think it&#x27;s shaping up to be a corker!

The Wii U generation had a lot of potential but its life was cut short in the end due to the lackluster sales of the system. One thing that was never expanded upon was the ability to play with not just one, but two GamePads at the same time - allowing players to come together for some dual-screen action.
While Nintendo acknowledged that it was possible, many have been left wondering why nothing ever came of this feature. In a recent interview with the YouTube channel MinnMax, former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has elaborated on this. Yes, technically multiple GamePads could communicate with a Wii U, but other factors such as the system&#x27;s install base, lifespan, and no unique games or ideas for such a feature played a part. Here&#x27;s the full exchange:

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is set to be bigger and better than previous entries in the series, and as part of this, it&#x27;s going to have more features and options to provide the best experience possible.
This will include English and Japanese language subtitle and dub support. The good news is that users won&#x27;t have to download these language support features, like some other games. As highlighted on Nintendo&#x27;s social channels - &quot;no additional download&quot; will be required.

                              <span>Act like a cat (for the most part)
As we inch closer to launch day on July 19, one of the most fun games to think about right now is Stray, an adventure game about being a cat in a futuristic world run by robots. The trophy list is now out in the wild (courtesy of sites like Exophase and Powerpyx), and some of the descriptions give us a better idea of what to expect from Stray&#x27;s scope.
Most notably, there&#x27;s a pacifist challenge, one for meowing 100 times, another for being sneaky enough to go undetected, and a speedrun trophy for finishing the game in under two hours. From everything we&#x27;ve seen of Stray so far, I&#x27;m not surprised that it can be completed so quickly — and to be honest, that actually sounds wonderful. Two hours seems like a nice runtime for a better-informed, more efficient s…</span>

                              <span>Why Wai Wai?
It’s hard not to look back at Konami’s Famicom days and not get a little misty-eyed about how it used to be a fun company before the soul was sold out from under it by the corporate powers. It’s even harder once you look at Wai Wai World 2. Playing the game is like finding a horse murderer’s photo album and discovering it’s full of colorful pictures of ponies. It’s all wide-eyed and cute until you realize, “These were their first victims.”
The original Wai Wai World was a blast, just not a very big blast. It did its job bringing together a bunch of awesome Konami characters but did so into a clunky game full of annoyances. If you can believe it Wai Wai World 2 does the same thing, but with only one real annoyance: Upa. But then, babies ruin absolutely everything.

I don&#x27;t care…</span>

                              <span>Bouncing Back
Long-running developer/publisher Tate Multimedia has announced that it is expanding its operations to include third-party publishing. The Polish company has previously only published titles within its own catalog, but is now looking to branch out into carrying other studios&#x27; wares.
&quot;We know the ups and downs and understand the challenges on both sides of the developer-publisher relationship,&quot; Tate Multimedia VP Paul Leskowicz in a press release. &quot;This makes working with third parties the logical next step, and we are excited to share our expertise with studios in the months and years to come. We know how important both retaining ownership of an IP and cash flow is for an indie studio and we want to make sure our collaborative approach and financial commitment give clear visibility and comfort to our partners in that regard.&quot;

Founded in 2000, Tate Multimedia is perhaps best known for its 3D adventure series Kao the Kangaroo. Just last month, the studio released a long-in-development sequel, which sees the antipodean hero traveling the world on a quest to rescue his sister while honing his fighting skills. Despite its somewhat under-the-radar presence, our own Chris Carter found it to be a solid, charismatic, and entertaining entry to the ever-popular mascot platformer genre.
Kao the Kangaroo is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Come December, it&#x27;ll have been four years since Heroes of the Storm was given the dreaded maintenance mode treatment. While the game wasn&#x27;t abandoned, developmental assets were significantly curbed, and Heroes hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of major new content updates since. For the time being that may not change; as Blizzard is giving us a heads-up that Heroes of the Storm will remain online in the future, but doesn&#x27;t promise anything big.
Here&#x27;s the full, far-too-brief statement:
Moving forward we will support Heroes in a manner similar to our other longstanding games, StarCraft and StarCraft II. In the future, we’ll continue seasonal rolls and hero rotations, and while the in-game shop will remain operational there are no plans for new for-purchase content to be added…</span>

                              <span>It Takes Two to make a thing go right
It Takes Two was one of the best surprises of last year. I&#x27;m a strong believer that we just don&#x27;t have enough couch co-op games out there, and gamers&#x27; outpouring of love for It Takes Two confirms that. There are plenty of good reasons why it took home Game of the Year at the 2021&#x27;s Game Awards, and I think it&#x27;s great to see such creative titles get the recognition it deserves. It Takes Two has continued to be successful after last year&#x27;s award season, because this morning, developer Hazelight Studios announced that the game had surpassed 7 million copies sold.
https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1545422823899922437
The studio celebrated with a tweet that featured a picture of Cody&#x27;s voice actor Joseph Balderrama and what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Cutie the elephant. Although Balderrama is lifting Cutie over his head, we&#x27;re assured in the replies that nothing untoward is happening... sure, I&#x27;ll believe that when I see it.
It Takes Two is one of the next games up in the long line of film and television adaptations, and we learned a few months ago that the upcoming movie based on the game will be produced by none other than Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson. Or, more specifically, it&#x27;s being produced by Seven Bucks Productions, a studio founded by Johnson and Dany Garcia. Still no word on a cast or release date, but it at least gives us something to look forward to. Some fans are hoping for a sequel to the game as well, and I have to admit that &quot;It Takes Two 2&quot; is a pretty funny idea for a title.
Big congrats again to the team behind It Takes Two, because 7 million copies sold is no small feat. Here&#x27;s hoping that the game continues to have success in the future, and that Hazelight channels this momentum into another great release in the coming years.

Sony&#x27;s 2000 cinematic adventure game Aconcagua is getting an English patch. Though it only ever released in Japan, an English fan translation is making the game available for new audiences on July 11.
Hilltop, which has worked on translations of other games like Squaresoft&#x27;s Japan-only street racing RPG Racing Lagoon, is publishing the English patch for Aconcagua.
This Sony release is pretty obscure; I&#x27;ll be honest, I hadn&#x27;t heard of it until this translation announcement. It received a 29/40 from Famitsu at the time, which isn&#x27;t exactly a rave review.
That said, it&#x27;s more about the curiosity of it. As you can see in the trailer, Aconcagua is a narrative adventure, blending action scenes with exploration and cinematic moments. The …</span>

The creators of Curse of the Dead Gods are back with another action roguelite game called Ravenswatch, and this time, you aren&#x27;t alone — there&#x27;s four-player co-op support.
Announced this week at Nacon Connect 2022, Ravenswatch will star playable heroes with abilities &quot;inspired by characters from folktales and legends.&quot; Right off the bat, we&#x27;ve got the Red Hood, the Pied Piper, Beowulf, and the Snow Queen, with &quot;more to come.&quot;

On the gameplay front, expect randomly generated maps and character builds to be at the forefront, with iconography and themes plucked from &quot;The Three Little Pigs to Norse mythology to One Thousand and One Nights,&quot; among other stories.

                              <span>A lot of it covers the first five hours
Nintendo just debuted a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview video on the company&#x27;s Japanese YouTube account, and it&#x27;s pretty comprehensive! Despite the fact that it&#x27;s in Japanese, it&#x27;s actually very easy to tell what&#x27;s going on.
Here&#x27;s what the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 overview touches on, vaguely:
Intercut big picture/conflict story elements, and the war between the two major factions
The interpersonal relationships between the six core party members
Lots of footage of overworld exploration
An in-depth look at combat, the different roles, combos, and swapping between party members
The Ouroboros system unveiled in one of the first debut videos
The &quot;guest&quot; party system (this is arguably the most spoiler-heavy part, as it showcases a ton of characters at once)
Township wandering/camp use/gemcrafting
A season pass recap and an amiibo support explanation (ours is more informational!)
In other Xenoblade-related news, Nintendo even came out with a digital calendar for July, which has a cheeky marked-off spot on July 29 to celebrate the release of the game. To grab it you&#x27;ll need to spend 50 My Nintendo platinum points (just remember that it&#x27;s a digital download, not a physical calendar).
Hopefully we&#x27;ll get some news as to what the My Nintendo physical reward is soon enough! Typically that info comes within seven days of the game&#x27;s release, give or take a week.

                              <span>This feels like a 2010s argument from EA
I don&#x27;t really envy anyone who has to defend Diablo Immortal, especially if they had no direct input with its monetization systems. You&#x27;re caught between a rock and a hard place, right?! The entire endgame is predicated on spending money, and the mixup between what constitutes pay-to-win and what &quot;equipment&quot; is really didn&#x27;t do the game any favors. Now, Blizzard is saying Diablo Immortal microtransactions are OK because most people don&#x27;t partake in them. What year is it?
Speaking to the LA Times, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra does just that. Ybarra contends that &quot;the monetization comes in at the end game,&quot; and that &quot;the philosophy was always to lead with great gameplay and make sure that hundreds of millions of people can go through the whole campaign without any costs...from that standpoint, [he] feels really good about it as an introduction to Diablo.&quot; He also cites the &quot;high user reviews on the App Store&quot; as proof that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the game.
Seeking a follow-up, the LA Times got a response back from a Blizzard rep, who noted that &quot;the vast majority of players aren&#x27;t spending money&quot; on Diablo Immortal microtransactions, and that &quot;50% of players have never played a Diablo game before.&quot;
The idea that predatory monetization schemes are fine because only a small percentage of whales dole out chunks of cash is something straight out of an EA executive&#x27;s mouth in the 2010s. It&#x27;s old hat! Executives really need to get a little bit more creative if they&#x27;re going to keep defending this stuff, especially amid issues like not even being able to release the game in certain countries because of the cash model.
Don&#x27;t you all have bank accounts?

Epic Games Store users will be able to bag themselves an absolute gem of a title for free next week, as Dotemu&#x27;s Wonder Boy: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap will be the next title offered up to all EGS customers gratis.

Developed by Lizardcube and released in 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap is a remake done right. Based upon the excellent 1989 Sega Master System RPG, Lizardcube&#x27;s title recreates the cart-based classic in a 1:1 capacity, switching out the 8-bit visuals for stylish and attractive hand-drawn visuals. In addition, the remake features a charming, rerecorded score, and includes new features such as additional difficulty options and a new playable hero, Wonder Girl.

In addition to the Wonder Boy remake, Epic Games Store will also be giving away  Baeloth&#x27;s Gladiator of the Dark Pits expansion pack, for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure title Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm. Players need only log in to the D&amp;D title from July 14 to automatically unlock access to the DLC expansion.
The new titles will be made available for all to download from July 14-21. Until then, players can still bag themselves the 2016 horror sequel Killing Floor 2 and 2020&#x27;s fantasy card battler Ancient Enemy. If you do not have it already, be sure to pick up The Dragon&#x27;s Trap. Without hyperbole, it is one of the most enjoyable, enduring, and compelling remakes ever made.

                              <span>&quot;We have been steadily moving more development resources towards the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series&quot;
Major Red Dead Online support is coming to an end, according to a new blog post directly from Rockstar Games.
After spending the majority of the post talking about how much stuff is coming to GTA Online, the team broke the news to fans that major development would no longer be a focus for Red Dead Online — something a lot of folks felt was a long time coming. Here&#x27;s the initial salvo:
&quot;Over the past few years, we have been steadily moving more development resources towards the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series — understanding more than ever the need to exceed players’ expectations and for this next entry to be the best it can possibly be — and as a result, we are in the process of making some changes to how we support Red Dead Online.&quot;

It&#x27;s a carefully-worded statement that you&#x27;ve read a billion times: the &quot;end of life,&quot; or &quot;maintenance mode&quot; post that tries not to piss off fans. While Red Dead Online users will keep getting monthly and seasonal events (as well as telegram missions), &quot;major themed content updates&quot; are out, and the team says that they&#x27;ll continue to share fan creations on social media.
Expect Rockstar to fully embrace the GTA universe for the foreseeable future, as it continues to spice up their moneymaker GTA Online, and continues working on the next mainline game — which is for sure going to break tons of records and make investors very happy.

Between the quiet town, the rope bridges, and the dangerous lookouts, it seems like a ripe area to explore for adventurous would-be assassins. Ambrose Island is free DLC for all Hitman 3 owners as well.

With the Final Fantasy VII Remake changes out in the universe, the Crisis Core remaster story was potentially in danger, as it were — but according to a new IGN interview with Square Enix leadership, that seemingly will not be a concern.
Producer Mariko Sato confirms that the Crisis Core re-release wasn&#x27;t a direct answer to the Remake storyline, and that it&#x27;s more of an unrelated meta effort to bring back the Final Fantasy VII universe as a whole. Square Enix producer Yoshinori Kitase elaborates: &quot;I do recall that it was towards the end of the Final Fantasy VII Remake development that we realized that with the quality we were able to bring to Final Fantasy VII Remake, we might be able to create something for the stories that are actually surrounding Fi…</span>

                              <span>Capcom demos will be available at SDCC
Since that initial burst of exciting information, Capcom has been good on its word to &quot;go dark&quot; on its upcoming release Street Fighter 6, much to the dismay of the eager fanbase. Still, for anyone attending San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC), good news, as the SF6 demo will be in attendance for your perusal. Fab!
Anyone visiting Capcom&#x27;s booth at the insanely crowded show will have the opportunity to check out the same demo played by press at Summer Game Fest last month. Fighting against a pal or the CPU, players can check out World Warriors Ryu, Luke, Chun-Li, and Jamie in a few fast minutes of one-on-one warfare. As the first publicly available demo in North America, it&#x27;s sure to be pretty popular, so be sure to get in line early if you wanna hit the streets and other SDCC attendees (Disclaimer: Not in Real Life).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bSRqA4igQCo
In addition to the demo, Capcom will be showcasing some cool Street Fighter-themed graffiti art, painted live at the booth over the duration of the SDCC weekend. Attendees can then use the completed artworks as backdrops for photo opportunities. Smash that Like button. Or something. Finally, a special Street Fighter 6 panel will be taking questions from attendees about the new game, and offering up prizes in an impromptu trivia tournament. Sounds fun!
Oh, and if Street Fighter isn&#x27;t your thing, well, you&#x27;ve got some attitude mister, but fortunately, the Capcom booth will also be hosting demo pods for its epic fantasy adventure Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak and the latest of its 4000 retro compilations: Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium. So you can take time out from the crush and the coughing to play a few rounds of Saturday Night Slam Masters.
San Diego Comic-Con 2022 takes place the weekend of July 21-24. Street Fighter 6 will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms in 2023.

                              <span>Another argument for having multiple region accounts
A Pokemon Puzzle League Switch release is arriving on July 15, via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service. Notably, this comes eight years after the Game Boy Color-based Pokemon Puzzle Challenge was re-released on 3DS.
It&#x27;s our irregularly scheduled Nintendo 64 booster, and as usual, Japan is getting something a little different.
Here is what the US is getting (Pokemon Puzzle League)

Alternatively, here is what Japan is getting (Custom Robo, and Custom Robot V2):
https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1545212433035595776
As a recap, Pokemon Puzzle League was released in the US in 2000, as part of the Puzzle League, or, Panel de Pon series. It was basically a &quot;branded version&quot; of Panel de Pon, a franchise that came over as Tetris Attack and was immortalized ever since. Although a lot of people are going to write off &quot;a puzzle game coming to Switch Online,&quot; if you haven&#x27;t played it, give it a shot! Panel de Pon is a classic for a reason, and Pokemon Puzzle League does a great job of getting the core gameplay tenets of the series across.
That said, it would be fantastic to get Custom Robo as well, even if it was in untranslated form. This is where having multiple region accounts comes in handy, as I can just swap over to my Japanese login and play them if I want!

According to multiple sources, GameStop is initiating huge layoffs across its entire company, with redundancies expected to hit on an executive and store level, as well as the editorial team of tie-in-press outlet, Game Informer. While GameStop is yet to officially confirm the news, affected employees and industry insiders have already spread the grim news on social media.
GameStop&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer Mike Recupero — who stepped into the role in the wake of the bizarre &quot;GameStonks&quot; scandal one year ago — has already resigned from the company. According to a staff memo, penned by GameStop CEO Matt Furlong and seen by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo, GameStop expects &quot;a number of&quot; incoming redundancies as part of a major cost-cutting exer…</span>

                              <span>A Rough Deal
[Update: Daniel Mullins Games has confirmed that a PlayStation port of Inscryption is en route. A release date was not confirmed.]
One of our favorite spoilers, the Australian Classification ratings board, has updated its website with a new PlayStation listing for Daniel Mullins Games&#x27; deck-builder Inscryption, suggesting that the spooky roguelike card game is headed to PS4 in the very near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OPBP3kWDcNk
Released on PC in the fall of 2021, Inscryption turned plenty of heads in double-quick time with its incredibly creepy and disturbing aesthetic, compelling strategy gameplay, and fascinating &quot;found footage&quot; framing device. The indie hit would go on to feature in many Best of Year lists, even winning the Game of the Year award at the prestigious Game Developers Choice Award and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Awards.
While the title is yet to receive an announcement of any such port, this new rating all but confirms that Inscryption is headed to the console market. While this rating is strictly for PlayStation platforms, it is difficult to imagine that publisher Devolver Digital will not also be looking to release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. We will be sure to give you a heads up when official confirmation is forthcoming.
Inscryption is available now on PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

Patch 0.8.0 is out today for Vampire Survivors, and it hits the mark. With limit breaks further fueling the power fantasy — and the ability to auto-pick coin bags or floor chickens when leveling up — the horde-mowing action feels non-stop.
Wait, limit breaks? Yeah. With the new relic, Great Gospel, you&#x27;ll be able to boost weapons to a ridiculous degree once everything else is maxed out. So instead of the normal money-or-food choice when you level up toward the end of a run, you&#x27;ll be able to crank up stats like Area, Speed, and Might (with a percentage boost) on your favorite weapons.
Limit breaks are a toggle in Vampire Survivors, and to use them (they reset every run), you&#x27;ll first need to pry the Great Gospel from a new boss&#x27;s cold, skeletal hands. F…</span>

Dicey Dungeons is one of those &quot;if you know, you know&quot; indie games — it&#x27;s garnered something of a cult following over the past three years that it&#x27;s been out, and for good reason (we gave it a 10 in our review). The charming visuals, unique concept, and engaging gameplay have made the game a continued success, and after some releases for Nintendo Switch and Xbox, Dicey Dungeons is finally getting a mobile release for iOS and Android. In addition to the new platform, the game is also getting a free DLC update called Reunion, which will give players 4-5 hours of new gameplay released in six episodes.
The game&#x27;s creator Terry Cavanagh dropped the news earlier today on his Twitter — he&#x27;s also known for creating other titles like VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Cavanagh has secured his spot as a prolific game designer in the indie space, so it&#x27;s really cool to see his games continue to have life and community surrounding them long after their releases.

Not only will Dicey Dungeons run well on mobile devices, but its gameplay actually suits the platform really well. Roguelikes are great to play in short bursts, and since it&#x27;s turn-based, you don&#x27;t have to be glued to the screen every second if you don&#x27;t want to be. That makes Dicey Dungeons perfect for playing on your phone during a commute, or when you&#x27;re waiting at the DMV, or when you&#x27;re doing literally anything else.
Cavanagh even confirmed in the replies to his initial tweet that you can easily stop in the middle of a run and continue it later without losing any of your progress.
Dicey Dungeons is available for $4.99 on iOS and Android, and the free DLC update is live now as well. The game&#x27;s composer Chipzel also released the DLC soundtrack on Bandcamp if you want to take a listen to that as well.

                              <span>The King of the Koopas gets a LEGO makeover
Making LEGO sets that are designed with adults in mind is one of the best decisions the company ever made, because LEGO has released some really awesome, complex builds over the past few years. Just in their Nintendo collaboration alone, which debuted in 2020, they gave us the buildable NES and the &quot;?&quot; block with different levels from Super Mario 64 on the inside. LEGO&#x27;s newest release is another banger in the Mario-themed line: a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs.
I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t played with LEGO since I was a kid, but man, they&#x27;ve really stepped up their game over the past few years. The Might Bowser figure is made of up over 3,000 pieces, some of which were designed specifically for this build. He&#x27;s incredibly detailed, but this Bowser doesn&#x27;t just look great — you can move his head around and shoot a little LEGO fireball out of his mouth. In addition, the Senior Designer on the project Carl Merriam says that they &quot;took inspiration from a few forms of puppetry&quot; and added loose joints to Bowser&#x27;s legs and tail so he looks like he&#x27;s jumping when you pick him up.

But wait, there&#x27;s more! LEGO fans who own a LEGO Super Mario Starter Course can actually battle against Bowser with Mario, Luigi, or Peach.
Basically, if you take your little interactive figure from that set and bounce it on Bowser, it will make noises from the game and play battle animations. How cool is that? It&#x27;s that extra attention to detail that makes this a really impressive build, in my opinion.
The Mighty Bowser figure hits stores on October 1, 2022, and will retail for $269.99 on the LEGO website or wherever LEGO is sold, so start saving up now if you&#x27;re dying to add him to your collection!

                              <span>Shiny adventure to become shinier still
THQ Nordic has announced that it will release an upgraded edition of its zen-like adventure game Biomutant on PS5 and Xbox Series X this fall. The revamped release will be available to purchase on both platforms from September 6, with free upgrades offered to PS4 and Xbox One Biomutant players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PismKvxhFpc
Released in the spring of 2021 after a particularly lengthy development period, Biomutant is an ecological tale of a fantasy world under siege from a mysterious and creeping corruption. Players guide a fully customizable character through the anthropomorphic society on a mission to rescue the Tree of Life, the roots of which are decaying due to the corruption&#x27;s presence. Developed by Experiment 101, Biomutant was an extremely ambitious project, that unfortunately launch to very middling reviews, though it was praised for its impressive visuals and interesting custom character mechanics.
This new edition of Biomutant will offer players three distinct visual modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X. &quot;Quality,&quot; which will run at 30 FPS  at a 4K resolution; &quot;Quality Unleashed,&quot; which will run at &quot;40-plus&quot; FPS at a 4K resolution; and &quot;Performance,&quot; which will run at 60 FPS at 1440p. For Xbox Series S users, these three modes will run at 1440p, 1440p, and 1080p respectively. The PS5 edition will also be optimized for the DualSense, offering support for Haptic Feedback, adaptive triggers, and speaker sound. Both editions will support faster load times and will arrive fully updated in regards to patches.
Biomutant is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

Following applications filed this year by LaLiga and a Serie A rightsholder in Malta, three local ISPs have been ordered to block IP addresses and servers on demand. Yet again in an IPTV blocking case, a secret agreement lies behind the scenes.

                              <span>Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven&#x27;t posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it&#x27;s quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke&#x27;s on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I&#x27;m just quite glad I&#x27;ve (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

                              <span>I thought I wanted a gardening game. The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It&#x27;s a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There&#x27;s no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

                              <span>Monster Hunter has always been a series I&#x27;ve admired from afar. Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I&#x27;ve watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.
So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard&#x27;s gooch. And I think I&#x27;m enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.

                              <span>Madison is a fun game to write about. It&#x27;s a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca&#x27;s (that&#x27;s you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, &quot;fun&quot; here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it&#x27;s about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn&#x27;t that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You&#x27;ve got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don&#x27;t have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

In a bleak country full of absurd events happening at breakneck pace, modder Dan Douglas is doing his best to capture them in his level, Duke Smoochem 3D. Barely a day after British prime minister Boris Johnson announced his intent to resign, Douglas has already added it to his yet-unfinished level. And yes, he&#x27;s made it even sillier.

                              <span>A team of actual real-life cats have apparently released a video game, and who am I to question marketing? A Building Full Of Cats does seem like a game cats might make, a hidden object game with so very many cats to &#x27;pet&#x27; (find and click on). It&#x27;s some nice cat-clicking for under £2.

Devs Supermassive Games are referring to the multiplayer as ‘Wolf Pack’, which makes me wish Zach Galifianakis would pop up to comment on your playthrough. Refresh your memory about Hacket’s Quarry by watching the launch trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the early access experience of Vampire Survivors, hopping back on every few weeks to check out a new update and do all the new stuff (and make all the new explosions). The roguelikelike survival arcade game has grown a lot, and fast, especially considering it started as a solo project. As it nears version 1.0, the latest big update has added a new final boss to the final level, a flashy battle.

                              <span>Nobody likes mannequins, except maybe Andrew McCarthy. Nobody likes dead bodies being puppeted around out much either, except maybe Andrew McCarthy. That’s why I’m slightly disappointed that Supermassive Games didn&#x27;t hire the legendary 1980s actor to star in The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me, which revealed a little more about its spooky murder doll house in a new story trailer. I’m sure you’ll be thoroughly creeped out when you watch it below.

                              <span>Modders have been getting busy with FSR 2.0, AMD’s latest, recently open source-ified, Nvidia DLSS-esque upscaling tech. First someone got FSR 2.0 working in Cyberpunk 2077, then someone modded the Cyberpunk mod to get FSR in Dying Light 2, and then someone discovered the mod of the mod could also mod Metro Exodus. Now, redditor Muddymind has figured out how to tweak the Metro mod so that it can act as an Nvidia DLAA clone, skipping the upscaling bit to solely provide better image quality and anti-aliasing.

                              <span>Protect the innocent and uphold the law. That&#x27;s what Robocop is programmed to do, and you&#x27;ll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic &#x27;80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop&#x27;s precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting one of the best, and most underrated, Pokémon games from the Nintendo 64 library in Pokémon Puzzle League next week.
On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&#x27;s long journey to release nears its end, and after getting a release date and story trailer in May, curious fans can finally see what gameplay looks like in a new video. 
A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.</span>

From the very beginning, Nintendo handhelds have been a powerhouse in the puzzle genre, championing games that might have been lost in the bombastic, graphics-obsessed arena of home consoles. Switch’s bridging of the portable/home console divide means it upholds that proud puzzling tradition and gives on-the-go gamers a chance to dive deeper than ever before into the ever-addictive world of puzzlers.

Sabotage Studio&#x27;s retro-style RPG Sea of Stars was recently delayed to 2023, but it hasn&#x27;t been all bad news for fans of the upcoming, frankly stunning-looking pixel art game. Yesterday, the developer announced that the title would also be making its way to Sony consoles, and, alongside that, we got a really good look at the game&#x27;s combat.
Thierry Boulanger, creative director at Sabotage Studio, shared a breakdown on PlayStation.Blog of the combat, which is heavily inspired by Super Nintendo classics like Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG. Boulanger said that the team had some very clear ideas of what they wanted to start with: &quot;there would be seamless transitions from navigation to combat, no random encounters, and no grinding&quot;. Sounds utterly perfect.

The humble Game Boy was an absolute marvel back in the day. Released prior to the SNES, the handheld system seemed positively futuristic when compared to the decidedly bulkier NES / Famicom. Looking at it today, however, there are plenty of noticeable drawbacks that have been ironed out considerably in the decades since with successors like the GBA, DS, and of course, the Switch.
Crucially, the original Game Boy displayed its games via an LCD display that could only render four distinct olive green colours. This meant that many classic games, from Tetris all the way to Pokémon Red and Blue were effectively displayed in &quot;black and white&quot;, leaving gamers to use their imagination to envision what their favourite game worlds would truly look like in full colour.

We got to see a little bit more of Bright Memory: Infinite during &#x27;not-E3&#x27; last month. This action FPS blasted onto Steam last year with stunning visuals and electrifying combat that — with the cyberpunk feel, natural surroundings, and those weapons — reminds us a little bit of the fantastic Crysis.
Looking at trailers, we wondered &quot;how would publisher Playism and developer FYQD Studio pull off a port of this beautiful-looking game?&quot; Especially as it&#x27;s not Cloud-based. Now we&#x27;ve got our first glimpse of the game running on Switch and a release date!

It wasn&#x27;t long ago that Monster Hunter Rise was updated to version 10.0.2, but it&#x27;s clear Capcom has been working its little socks off, because version 10.0.3 is now live for all players.
The latest update isn&#x27;t as meaty as the previous one (which makes sense given a lot of it was earmarked for the Sunbreak DLC), but it does introduce some important bug patches and improvements that you&#x27;ll want to get downloaded.

Cygames may be known for its success in the mobile space with titles like Granblue Fantasy, Shadowverse, and Dragalia Lost (with which the developer partnered with Nintendo) but the company seems like it has an interest in translating these IPs into more traditional console games. Last year’s excellent Shadowverse: Champion&#x27;s Battle showed that the popular card game could work quite effectively in the format of a JRPG, and now Cygames is doing it again by taking Battle Champs—a failed Clash of Clans clone—and repurposing it into a roguelite called Little Noah: Scion of Paradise. Though it’s lacking in new ideas, Little Noah does a fantastic job of giving players a tough, cute, and enjoyable action experience that feels great to play.
The story follows Noah, the chipper alchemist captain of a majestic airship, who quickly finds herself trapped when her airship crashes just outside mysterious shifting ruins. Here, she soon meets a snarky amnesiac cat (who is not named Morgana…) and a creepy villain called Greigh who both seem to have some kind of connection to her lost father. Left with no choice but to scour the ruins for the parts she’ll need to repair her ship, Noah thus sets out on an adventure to save Zipper (the cat) from Greigh and maybe learn more about what happened to her father.

Back in the &#x27;90s, whoever thought that Nintendo would team up with JRPG giants Square Enix (then known as Square or Squaresoft) to create a Mario RPG starring the Italian plumber, Princess Peach, and Bowser? Not us! But they did, and we&#x27;re forever grateful for the existence of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.
Despite Mario continuing to venture into the RPG genre with two separate series — Paper Mario and Mario &amp; Luigi — we&#x27;ve never seen a direct sequel to Square&#x27;s original Mario RPG or even a remake, only ports via Virtual Console or on the SNES Classic. But leave it to the fans to create something truly special — a modern-day mock-up of what a Super Mario RPG remake might look like.

After quietly announcing a western release date just a few days ago, Square Enix has now shared a brand new trailer for its upcoming strategy RPG, The DioField Chronicle.
The trailer, shared by Nintendo Everything, is only in Japanese for the time being, but it shows off a snippet of gameplay outside of the tactical battles. But don&#x27;t worry, there are plenty of those diorama-style skirmishes to see in the short trailer too.

Featured as part of Nacon&#x27;s Connect 2022 presentation, a new trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City has revealed gameplay and shed more light on the return of Detroit&#x27;s cybernetic law enforcer, including a first glimpse of veteran actor Peter Weller, who was revealed to be returning to the role of Alex Murphy in Robo-form.

Round Up: Every Nintendo Switch Game Featured During Nacon Connect 2022

The trailer features first-person footage from the game, as well as a look at various dialogue cutscenes and ol&#x27; Robo drawers himself without his visor at the end. While it&#x27;s obvious that this isn&#x27;t footage of the Switch version of the game, it&#x27;s great to get an idea of what developer Teyon has lined up.

Back in February I looked at the situation again and Linux started outrunning Windows 11 on the i9-12900K with the latest Linux kernel at the time. But with a few more months having passed and for the Intel Alder Lake hybrid processors to mature under Windows and Linux, how do things stand now? Here are some new benchmarks.</span>

                              <span>The creator is fully aware of the &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t spread this around&quot; comments!
As is the case with every fan creation that&#x27;s openly shared on Twitter, YouTube, and plenty of other places directly by the creator themselves, I should note that this is yet another &quot;the creator has directly shared this on Twitter&quot; situation. Digital artist Finn shared the latest footage of their Super Mario RPG remake on Twitter, which reworks the graphical system of the game into a new charming modern style.
Note that Finn has their response to the &quot;but you shouldn&#x27;t share these types of things online&quot; statement already ready to go:
&quot;Just thought I’d put this out there since I’ve seen some stuff floating around: My SMRPG project, while made in a game engine, will not be available to play, for legal reasons:) similarly, I do not plan to remake a significant portion of the game as to not infringe on copyright.&quot;

That&#x27;s why I put the phrase &quot;mockup&quot; in the headline. While this was initially shared around as a project that could see the light of day, Finn cleared things up themselves; noting that they wanted to share their artistry with the world without distributing it, or remaking the entire game.
Still, you love to see it. These types of fan projects lead to full official releases more often than you&#x27;d think, and although it would take a lot of legwork to get this one off the ground, I hope it happens one day.

                              <span>How games depict America, for better and for worse
It was fun to sit on my rooftop and watch the fireworks over the Los Angeles cityscape for the Fourth of July this year, but I gotta be honest — it didn’t feel like there was much to celebrate this year. Regardless of the depressing state of our country, the holiday got me thinking about Americana in video games and how they depict our country, for better and for worse.
Aside from Japan, the United States is the world’s leader in video game production, so it makes perfect sense that developers would borrow themes, imagery, and iconography from their country of origin. Sometimes it’s to pay homage to where they came from, other times it’s with the express purpose of critiquing the systems and ideals that run our nation, and sometimes it’s a…</span>

                              <span>By Gunnm, it&#x27;s almost here
Why be a first-person-shooter when you can be a first-person-shooter-hack-n-slash-fighting-game-driving-game-open-world-indie-RPG? That was the question asked by Studio FYQD&#x27;s dynamic PC actioner Bright Memory: Infinite. And soon, console owners can find the answer to that query themselves, with a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch port releasing on July 21.
The work of almost a single developer, Bright Memory: Infinite tells the anime-infused tale of Shelia, a special agent dispatched to scenes of inexplicable anomalies. Kitted out with some incredible firepower and acrobatic, air-slicing sword skills, Shelia finds herself embroiled in interdimensional chaos, fighting off an army of invaders and questionable governmental conspirators in the eye of a raging storm.

While the trailers may give something of an impression of a full-price, 30-hour adventure, it should be noted that Bright Memory: Infinite is a very short affair, working better as a flashy score-attack title, to be played and replayed in efforts to achieve a slicker and more balletic performance each time. It&#x27;s undeniably a fabulous-looking title, and the talent of its one-man team cannot be understated, but it&#x27;s certainly something of an acquired taste. I dig it.
Bright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on July 21. The console port will feature all previously released costume DLC and support for Haptic Feedback, Gyroscopic Aiming, and other console-specific features.

Though big-name games can dominate the discussion, there are some cool indie projects slotted for the coming months. Today, PlayStation showcased seven indie games coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5 in the future.
All of these games have either been previously announced, or previously released on other platforms. That said, it&#x27;s an honestly great collection of rad games worth keeping an eye on, especially if some have slipped you by.
Sea of Stars
First up is Sea of Stars, the classic RPG from Sabotage Studio, which made The Messenger. It recently got delayed into 2023, but today Sabotage showed off some gameplay and mechanics. Actions can build up combos, and timed hits can increase your damage and mitigate incoming hits.

                              <span>No name yet, but here&#x27;s a teaser
The &quot;one last thing&quot; at the Nacon Connect 2022 showcase was a new Terminator game for PC and consoles, and while we don&#x27;t have a name yet — or anything concrete, footage-wise — we do know this is the &quot;first survival game set in the Terminator universe.&quot;
I bet you can predict everything that happens in this teaser trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_HNPT7efHq0
Nacon&#x27;s Terminator survival game is in production at Nacon Studio Milan, rather than Teyon, the team behind Terminator: Resistance, which some fans have rallied around.
Open-world survival in the wake of Judgment Day
&quot;The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic open world and features an original story that builds on the events of the official films,&quot; according to the studio.
&quot;You play as a group of nuclear apocalypse survivors fighting to stay alive in a time period between Judgment Day and the creation of John Connor’s resistance.&quot;
With little to grasp yet, this is a harder sell than another &#x27;80s-icon-turned-game, RoboCop: Rogue City, which shared the first look at gameplay during Nacon&#x27;s stream.
After playing way too many survival games, I can imagine what this game could look like — and really, I feel like it could go either way. Genre, scope, and budget are all top of mind when it comes to licensed games like this. And to me, this team is a wildcard. I am vaguely into the idea of fighting for life in an intimidating machine-dominated world, though.
Are you open to a Skynet survival game, or have you had your fill of Terminator tie-ins by now? Come to think of it, I&#x27;ve gone pretty deep in the Sega Genesis and SNES libraries over the years, but I&#x27;ve never touched RoboCop Versus The Terminator. Hmm.

                              <span>The founder of Florida-based VPN company TorGuard is listed as the prime suspect in a Greek fraud case. The authorities hold Ben Van Pelt personally responsible for roughly €2,000 in attempted fraudulent transactions carried out by an anonymous user of the service. Van Pelt&#x27;s legal team say the incredible allegations and a potential five-year prison sentence are hard to justify.

The decision, which overrules the opinion of a lower court, essentially gives so-called &#x27;copyright trolls&#x27; a green light to press ahead with cash settlement demands on a scale of their choosing.

Schim was one I failed to spot entirely, despite our Ed placing it among the best games he played at the event in LA. It&#x27;s a bouncy puzzle adventure about a frog-like creature who lives in shadows, and there&#x27;s a new trailer below.

And at today&#x27;s Nacon Connect, developers Spiders unveiled a new trailer which shows ballerina-turned-bodyguard Aegis fight off some metallic monstrosities, mixed in with a bit of parkour. Seriously, I&#x27;m excited for this one.

Appeal Studios’ Gangs Of Sherwood is an upcoming third-person PvE co-op action game that puts you in the dainty shoes of the Merry Men. This time though, it’s set in a dystopian future instead of Ye Merry Olde England. Watch the announcement teaser below to see what you think of that.

                              <span>Today’s Nacon Connect event had a bunch of licensed games starring pop culture figures both old and older, but one standout among them was Nacon Studio Milan’s upcoming Terminator survival game. Will you be able to play as Terminators? It&#x27;s not yet clear. Heck, it&#x27;s so early on the game doesn&#x27;t even have a proper name yet. Feel free to recoil in fear from the announcement teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Robocop: Rogue City aims to be authentic to the first three films in the series, which means it&#x27;ll either be a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human and a cutting satire of American culture, or it&#x27;ll be about fighting robot ninjas and having a jetpack. Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it&#x27;ll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that Skull And Bones has had a somewhat troubled development. Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate &#x27;em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there&#x27;s still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won&#x27;t catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that&#x27;s for sure.

From another angle, it makes total sense when you consider that the outcome of it all was info about BG3’s musically-tinged eighth patch, arriving later today. We’re finally getting those gnome bards, fam. You can check out the stream for yourselves below.

                              <span>The first unusual thing about Symphony Of War Colon The Nephilim Saga is that it&#x27;s a strategy game made in RPG Maker. That&#x27;s not particularly unusual, but it leads into the second unusual thing: that it&#x27;s also a good strategy game. The third unusual thing is one I didn&#x27;t even appreciate until I was a fair bit in: it&#x27;s not only a good strategy game &quot;for an RPG Maker game&quot;, but one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year.

Consequently, their stuff is often very competitive on price, and today we have a new low water mark for their P41 SSD thanks to a 15% off coupon at Amazon US. 
The massive 2TB model is now going for $221, down from $260, which is the lowest price we can find on a ~7000MB/s NVMe SSD of this capacity.

The games we played as kids, or spent all-nighters on as teens. It&#x27;s a surprisingly diverse list, and Matthew has one anecdote in particular involving the music of Danny Elfman that I think makes this a genuine must-listen episode. Do you have the same nostalgia games? Which ones instantly transport you to the past?

However, he also states the notice provides no clarification from Take-Two about how he&#x27;s actually breaching their copyright.

Foam Sword&#x27;s 2019 game evokes childhood joys of zooming around with your pal and tricking out your bicycle with reflectors and Spokey Dokeys.

With some Phoronix readers in the past having inquired about more Alder Lake benchmarks on the low-end, I picked up a Core i3 12100 processor that features four performance cores / eight threads. For those curious about the CPU performance and that of the integrated UHD Graphics 730, here are some Ubuntu Linux performance benchmarks with the i3-12100 and other similar processors.</span>

We have reason to celebrate: Ubisoft&#x27;s Skull and Bones launches on November 8 and looks quite good. News of the game&#x27;s resurrection (after a long delay) came today in a 20-minute Ubisoft Forward livestream that included a brief look at stunning new gameplay footage.
&quot;Will you live as pawns or die as pirates!&quot; This message kicked off the presentation that included a CGI trailer highlighting intense ship battles and a pirate&#x27;s infamy growing over t…</span>

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions&#x27; armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios&#x27; most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation Twitter account posted a small batch of announcements highlighting upcoming indie games headed to PlayStation. While Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card&#x27;s audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, &quot;spills out from your controller.&quot; We&#x27;re not sure what …</span>

                              <span>Supermassive Games has released a new story trailer for The Devil In Me, the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today&#x27;s new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it&#x27;s a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.” 

This set is notable for Lego, too, because it utilizes newly-created Lego elements to recreate the look of Bowser’s iconic back spikes. Plus, it featur…</span>

                              <span>Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

The court initially dismissed the case, ruling that it didn&#x27;t have jurisdiction over the foreign defendants. However, a recent order from the appeals court in a separate piracy lawsuit changed that.

The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.

Lenneth is the 2006 enhanced PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile, which first arrived in North America in 2000. Lenneth came to mobile devices in 2018 but it hasn’t been available on a home console since the original version arrived on PS1. 
Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth comes to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29, the same day that Valkyrie Elysium launches. It will be sold separately for a yet-to-be-announced price. You can also get it as part of the $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition of Valkyrie Elysium.</span>

                              <span>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

                              <span>Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don&#x27;t worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018&#x27;s God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we&#x27;re less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic &quot;Father and Son&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won&#x27;t spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok&#x27;s take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.</span>

                              <span>Guerrilla Games and PlayStation have been steady at work, making Horizon Forbidden West an even better game than it was at launch with updates that add transmog, fix visual shimmering, improve graphics, and more. Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. 
More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…</span>

                              <span>Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita&#x27;s original vision of Live a Live, we&#x27;re getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it&#x27;s brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It&#x27;s Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don&#x27;t offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.</span>

We&#x27;re doing difficult work here. This week, it&#x27;s a question of a helping hand when you&#x27;re stuck versus something so unsubtle that it&#x27;ll take your face off and you&#x27;ll be glad for it and even be miffed if it doesn&#x27;t happen.

                              <span>Mythological mash-up action RPG Valkyrie Elysium will hit PC on November 11th, Square Enix have announced, six weeks after its initial release on current-gen PlayStations. Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.

Not only that, but the fantasy roguelike deckbuilder will be out tomorrow, July 7th.

Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn&#x27;t mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I&#x27;ve returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I&#x27;ve taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn&#x27;t stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I&#x27;ve learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

It was due out on 11th October later this year, but has now been pushed back to the 24th January 2023. They say it just needs a bit more polishing up before it arrives, which is fine by me. I mean, no point rushing something out before it&#x27;s ready is there?

The game’s co-writer, Guardians Of The Galaxy and The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, isn’t returning either. You can kind of understand Gunn not being involved, considering the game’s already been written.

                              <span>Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That&#x27;s the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn&#x27;t good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don&#x27;t need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It&#x27;s still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there&#x27;s a whole section that&#x27;s such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there&#x27;s a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I&#x27;m not alone in thinking so, &#x27;cos in 2009 this was RPS&#x27;s Game Of The Year. Can&#x27;t blame me for that. I didn&#x27;t even work here then.

                              <span>In the 100 or so hours I&#x27;ve spent playing Death Stranding in the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve often wondered about the state of Sam Bridges&#x27; limbs. Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I&#x27;m not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold&#x27;s new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that&#x27;s right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it&#x27;s quite possibly the strangest game you&#x27;ll play all year.

                              <span>It’s not usually good news when an emperor decides to directly involve themselves in your business, but sci-fi 4X RTS Dune: Spice Wars certainly thinks it is. House Corrino will be landing their Sardaukar warriors on the desert planet of Arrakis this summer to challenge the Atreides, Harkonnens, Smugglers and Fremen as part of the game’s next major update. The new playable faction is the second of Spice Wars’ Early Access roadmap milestones.

                              <span>This week, far too much of my brainspace has been occupied by the JiuShark M.2-Three: a tower-style cooler for NVMe SSDs that’s just launched in China. Honestly, look at it. For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

Well, let’s have a quick refresher of what else happened in 2002 for some perspective: Queen’s Golden Jubilee, check, last confirmed sighting of the Yangtze river dolphin, righto, SARS starts spreading… okay, let’s just stick to tipping our hats at one of Poland’s best known games developers for now. You can start doing that when the CDPR 20th anniversary livestream kicks off at 3pm BST/4pm CEST/7am PDT today.

This six-core twelve-thread chip is a solid upgrade over the likes of the Ryzen 5 3600 from the previous generation, but mostly makes sense in a new budget gaming build or as an upgrade for an older Ryzen 1000 or Ryzen 2000 system.

Yoshimi Yasuda, former CEO of Kadokawa Games (the original publishers of Lollipop Chainsaw) vaguely teased the game&#x27;s return last month during its 10-year anniversary, but it&#x27;s now been confirmed that the remake is definitely happening and that Yusada will be returning to the series alongside his new studio, Dragami Games.
If you never had the pleasure of playing Lollipop Chainsaw, watch the trailer below for a taste of the chaos.

                              <span>In the dead of night I&#x27;ve been hearing things. At first, I thought it was the neighbours next door enjoying a bit of karaoke. Maybe some twigs banging off a discarded Tesco trolley, creating a beautiful tune. No, I&#x27;m convinced it was the dulcet tones of Kiryu singing &quot;Dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo!&quot;, as a signal from the nether that Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 would be back on Game Pass having been removed last year. And by God, they&#x27;re there! They&#x27;re live! That&#x27;s rad!

                              <span>The most prolific indie studio of the last decade are preparing to bow out, with today bringing the early access launch of &quot;the last game from Zachtronics&quot;, Last Call BBS. It&#x27;s a puzzle-o-rama firing up a mysterious old computer to download pirated software from a BBS, letting us play everything from logic puzzles of circuits and flesh to a model kit-building simulation. I&#x27;ve played a wee bit and am keen to explore more, even as someone who is the absolute worst at Zachlikes.

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s played one of Firaxis&#x27; XCOM games in the last ten years will have a story about missed shots. Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they&#x27;re an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis&#x27; creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
&quot;It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder,&quot; he says.

As a modern revamp of an 18-year-old Half-Life mod by the same name, it&#x27;s an FPS where bullets are spheres of snow and guns are human arms... and snowball-launching crossbows. Not to mention it&#x27;s set in the 80&#x27;s with a synthwave backing track. I&#x27;m sold.

                              <span>Liam and I thought Overwatch 2&#x27;s first PVP beta was fine! It was just hard to say just how much of that came down to the &quot;2&quot; in its title. We jumped back into its ongoing second beta, in the hopes that we&#x27;d finally wrap our heads around the game. Maybe we&#x27;d got it all wrong the first time around? It&#x27;s the sequel to the biggest hero shooter out there! This time, this time we&#x27;d feel the &quot;2&quot; part come alive beneath our fingertips as we insta-locked Torbjorn on attack.
Dear reader, Liam and I emerged from our Overwatch 2 session having had a marvellous chat. We caught up on life, talked about Monster Hunter Rise, and how nice it is that the RPS Treehouse is complete again. Everything except Overwatch 2 itself was discussed... Which says it all, really.

                              <span>I like anime, but I possibly like anime intros even more. At their best they&#x27;re a rush of style and energy, they often feature better animation than the show that follows, and they are regularly scored by first rate Japanese jazz, rock or blues tracks. 

Netflix just posted the intro to the upcoming Cyberpunk anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and it&#x27;s got a Franz Ferdinand track over the top - but hey, it&#x27;s still pretty good.

                              <span>Capcom recently announced a 10-game Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, bundling together the six Game Boy Advance Battle Network titles and the various versions that were originally released. I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …</span>

                              <span>Skull and Bones, Ubisoft&#x27;s long-delayed pirate multiplayer game, rises from the depths of the sea on Thursday during a livestream presentation. Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don&#x27;t know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft&#x27;s blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here&#x27;s hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull &amp; Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate-focused Assassins&#x27; Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It&#x27;s attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…</span>

This buddy is either rusty or has never played it, but that&#x27;s okay; they just want to have a good time throwing hands. To accommodate them, you purposely assume a weaker form, unleashing only 5 percent of your true power to avoid obliterating them while they haplessly button-mash in a futile attempt to stay competitive. 
Laughs can be had but holding back so much isn&#x27;t necessarily fun because you want to go full force. If you&#x27;re in that friend&#x27;s shoes, you wish you could play more competently much quicker to avoid feeling inferior and babysat.

He touched briefly on his upcoming projects (yes, plural projects) and was happy to report that the game likely to come out first – Haunted Chocolatier – is a solo endeavor. Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games&#x27; remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That&#x27;s right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector&#x27;s edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said &quot;The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.&quot; The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let&#x27;s hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I&#x27;d love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.</span>

All the money raised will go directly to National Network for Abortion Fund&#x27;s Collective Power Fund.

But I did find a load of other official Deus Ex wallpapers which are so delightfully turn-of-the-millenium. Scanlines! Lensflare! Photoshop Difference Clouds filters! Come, admire, enjoy.

Picking up the bundle aids the National Organization For Women and the Center For Reproductive Rights in equal measure.

                              <span>Katharine has been raving about Tangle Tower ever since she reviewed it a couple of years ago, and I finally sat down and played it this weekend. I can confirm it&#x27;s really good! A lovely point and click mystery with some tricksy puzzles, but unlimited goes so you still get to feel clever - plus the story plays with some mystery tropes in really fun ways. But the real joy is its characters. It&#x27;s a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips.

                              <span>When discussing the founding of Starward Industries, game director Marek Markuszewski brings up all the points you might expect from a new team. The company wanted to gather a group of experienced but still-passionate developers, all focused on the idea of creating something ambitious despite the studio’s smaller size. The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.
Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…</span>

                              <span>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is the latest entry in Nintendo and Koei Tecmo’s Warriors series, which spans The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem. Like Hyrule Warriors, which received a Breath of the Wild-specific sequel in Age of Calamity, this new Warriors game is set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe. Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review. 
I interviewed Nintendo Co. Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes. We dove deep into the making of this new Musou, how the teams integrated Three Houses into it,…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve seen sequels rise above and plummet below their precursors. Months ago, I said Overwatch 2 was a redemption arc. And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I&#x27;ve gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls. In other words, I&#x27;m confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  


It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the …</span>

                              <span>You wouldn’t guess it from his child-like appearance, but gaming’s much-loved spherical hero turned 30 this year. Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

                              <span>With millions of dollars at stake, the legal battle over the Pulp Fiction &quot;NFT&quot; copyrights is heating up. Quentin Tarantino recently asked the court to dismiss the case because he still owns the rights to the screenplay. However, Miramax now argues that the movie director&#x27;s &#x27;limited rights&#x27; only apply to print publications and not NFTs.

Two leaders of the network received 44-month prison sentences and the other five were ordered to serve between 9 to 18 months. After the defendants gave up around one million euros of the amount they generated from the fraud, a court suspended their custodial sentences.

                              <span>Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?
Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!

                              <span>Microsoft, the company that brought us furry Sonic controllers and a Far Cry 6 console that resembled a bomb, has unveiled its latest kooky Xbox Series X sweepstakes, and it may be the coolest/dumbest one yet.
Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It&#x27;s hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.</span>

The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

                              <span>The Tour De France, the grandest race in professional cycling, started today. Across three weeks, 176 cyclists will ride 3328 kilometres (2068 miles) winding through France, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland, including the Alps and Pyrenees. As a keen cyclist and avid Tour watcher myself, I&#x27;m excited. So in celebration, over the coming weeks I&#x27;ll be gabbing about the Tour De France, cycling, and bikes in a wide variety of video games with my own Tour De Jeux, from big-budget open-world extravaganzas to cute wee indie adventures. Let&#x27;s start in the obvious place: the official Tour De France video game.

I&#x27;ve nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

                              <span>While I’ve been down in the hardware mines, searching for the best early Amazon Prime Day deals and choking on consumer advice fumes, Graham has been working on how to make this list a little more colourful and readable. Behold, then, our new-look guide to saving some cash on your next component or peripheral upgrade – even before Prime Day 2022 itself, which will run July 12th-13th.
What’s more, you won’t need an Amazon Prime account for any of these, unlike most of the big deals that launch on the 12th. Amazon’s Prime Day landing page might already point to various bits of discounted PC hardware but you won’t be limited to the big A alone, as plenty of rival retailers will be running their own, competing sales. I&#x27;ve included some of the best early non-Amazon deals right here, and I’ll eventually post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide for those who’d rather avoid Amazon entirely.

                              <span>The arrival of Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion has brought a swathe of quality of life improvements to Capcom&#x27;s beast-bashing action game, including support for Nvidia&#x27;s performance-boosting DLSS tech. Announced earlier this week as part of the game&#x27;s 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone&#x27;s hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that&#x27;s not exactly ideal.

In addition to, or perhaps instead of, anime openers, I put it to you that more games should celebrate their launch days with live action music videos - and after watching Capcom&#x27;s freshly unveiled &quot;Matsuken Sunbreak&quot; vid for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, I think you&#x27;ll heartily agree.

                              <span>Yesterday tech journalist Alex Hern, who has been making comparatively gentle fun of the crypto crash, pointed out that he didn&#x27;t Tweet about bitcoin in the boom times &quot;because it wasn&#x27;t funny then.&quot; So, after we posted yesterday about a crypto fan who very shoddily stole Itch and for some reason tagged Itch&#x27;s founder in a tweet about it, allow me to bring you the news that some No Man&#x27;s Sky players have come up with what I think is the most useful application of a crypto currency I&#x27;ve seen. And it works because it is deliberately valueless.

A free update yesterday added the option to display text in fonts which are intended to be easier to read for some people with dyslexia. The popular OpenDyslexic typeface is used for many languages, while Russian and Korean have their own fonts. I have a touch of the ol&#x27; dyslexia myself and do find this font helps me a bit.

                              <span>Adapting an established property in any medium has got to be a pretty tricky proposition. Satisfying the long term fans while keeping things approachable for newcomers on top of, well, making a good game. Add in the complexities of making a turn-based game based on an existing turn-based game and it’s surprising that developers don’t just collapse into gibbering, tentacle-waving Chaos Spawn.


Complex Games, the developers of recent XCOM-like Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters not only managed to resist the mutating power of the Warp, but produced an absolute cracker of a game. Suspecting pacts with Dark Powers were behind it, I put on my big Inquisitorial hat and set off to question Noah Decter-Jackson, the game’s Creative Director.

The first full expansion since Cottage Living launched a year ago, High School Years is set to do exactly what it says on the tin, massively expanding gameplay options for Sims in their teens.
The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there&#x27;s a fair bit of overlap with the series&#x27; established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that&#x27;s been on the fandom&#x27;s collective wish list for a very long time.

                              <span>Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment&#x27;s newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I&#x27;m hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game&#x27;s first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack&#x27;s thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don&#x27;t have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a &quot;punker granny&quot; or a &quot;famous streamer&quot; with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it&#x27;s difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.</span>

                              <span>As previously promised, Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op takes its first steps towards launch, thanks to a network beta flight scheduled for July.  
Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version. 
In a Halo Waypoint blog post, 343 lead software engineer Isaac Bender and lead world designer John Mulkey discussed the co-op mode’s feat…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ll soon have the chance to play EA&#x27;s highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this &quot;insider&quot; program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title &quot;Still working on it.&quot; The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series&#x27; skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it&#x27;s going to be a blast.</span>

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…</span>

In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it&#x27;s hard to parse through what&#x27;s happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, &quot;You will die here, and I will live forever.&quot; We&#x27;re sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, &quot;Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that&#x27;s a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it&#x27;s all about combat and little else.&quot;
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup of free games has arrived and it’s quite a good one, featuring Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon. 
All three of these games will be available to download for free for all three tiers of subscribers to the newly revamped PlayStation Plus – Premium, Extra, and Essential. You can add each to your library starting July 5 and they’ll be available until Aug. 1. That means you have until July 4 (next Monday) to download last month’s free games: God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. You can read more about the June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup here. 
Enough about June, though – it’s old news! Onto July 2022! Here’s what PlayStation has to say about each of this month’s free games: 
Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)
Arcadegeddon (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
While waiting for these games to go live, be sure to download last month’s games – God of War, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl – and then read about the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service to find out which new tier is right for you.

                              <span>Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title&#x27;s latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn&#x27;t have the power of Roadhog&#x27;s but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we&#x27;re also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You&#x27;ll just have to watch for yourself to find out!</span>

                              <span>We recently sat down with Takayuki Nakayama and Shuhei Matsumoto, Director and Producer of Street Fighter 6, respectively, for an interview about Capcom&#x27;s upcoming fighting game. We learn about how they&#x27;re pulling inspiration from the worlds of Final Fight and Third Strike, why Modern Control Type &quot;is not an &#x27;Easy Mode&#x27;&quot; and should be used in tournament play, and finally, how the team is learning from Street Fighter 5&#x27;s mistakes to ensure a vibrant future for the series.</span>

                              <span>Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&amp;2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn&#x27;t going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, &quot;How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Yes, please. I&#x27;d very much like that. Give it to me now.&quot; Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You&#x27;ll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you&#x27;ll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We&#x27;re not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it&#x27;s slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.</span>
