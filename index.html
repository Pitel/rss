Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?! is this week&#x27;s free PC game on the Epic Games Store. If you like the idea of a cooking simulator you can play alone or with a partner, this one&#x27;s wild — it&#x27;s set on a roving food truck in the &quot;radically-changed war-torn America of 2042.&quot;
After years of not quite breaking into the Cook, Serve, Delicious! series, I recently gave the second game another try and had a much better time handling food orders with a co-op partner on the same couch. So much so, I also picked up the third game on sale, and am now looking forward to the next title from Vertigo Gaming, Cook Serve Forever.
Unlike Overcooked, this game isn&#x27;t about moving around stage hazards, and you&#x27;ll have far more control over the types of food you&#x27;ll serv…</span>

Warner Bros. Games has released another character trailer for its upcoming open-world actioner Gotham Knights. Following on from previous showcases on Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl, this new trailer takes a look at the brutal, no-nonsense, gun-toting style of perhaps Gotham&#x27;s most dangerous vigilante, Red Hood.
As a former Robin and close confidant of The Dark Knight himself, Jason Todd learned his master&#x27;s ways in the art of close combat, stealth tactics, and precise detective work. However, following his death at the hands of The Joker and subsequent resurrection in the Lazarus Pit, Todd returned with a much shorter fuse, a deeper hatred of criminality, and an immensely more brutal approach to the concept of crime-fighting. While still a staunch ally of The Bat Family, Todd typically walks alone, perpetually on the razor-thin line of becoming the very thing he hates most.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;CDGtXujeQfM
Lacking the finesse of his Gotham Knights brethren, Red Hood brings core strength and ranged dominance to the party, taking down foes with bone-breaking close-quarters-combat and an array of firearms-based abilities. What he lacks in grace, Todd makes up for in raw power and earnest brutality. Unequipped with grapple abilities, Todd is able to traverse the high points of the city via air-bending skills powered by his trip to the Lazarus Pit. When the acrobatics of Nightwing or the precision of Batgirl cannot get the job done, Red Hood is here as your Mack Truck — the Knights&#x27; terrifying battering ram.
Hilariously, we are assured Todd is &quot;non-lethal&quot; in Gotham Knights, despite his rat-a-tat-tat actions.
Gotham Knights launches October 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>One of the top requests from fans was &quot;more challenging content&quot;
Right from the get-go, there was a wide variety of reactions to Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The copious &quot;chaos!&quot; exclamations in the reveal were definitely a driving factor in that divide, but as I dug into the game at launch, I found a lot to like, including some of the bolder and somewhat out-there choices with the narrative.
We sat down recently with director Daisuke Inoue and producer Jin Fujiwara to really take in the game&#x27;s impact thus far, and where it might be going now that the DLC campaign is underway.

A new crossover is headed to Epic Games&#x27; Fortnite, and it will rock the dragon. After a ton of rumors, chatter, and speculation, it looks like Dragon Ball is arriving in Fortnite.
The Fortnite Twitter account posted this ominous image of Shenron, the wish-granting dragon, today. &quot;Speak,&quot; it says. &quot;Name your wish...&quot;
As for now, it&#x27;s not clear what exactly this entails. More info looks to be arriving next week, on August 16.
https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1557728549737443336
Speculation has run rampant over Dragon Ball arriving in Fortnite for a while. The leaker community around Epic&#x27;s battle royale discovered a bunch of files that pointed towards skins and cosmetics, even including the Capsule Corp logo.
Rock the dragon
As for who&#x27;s up, I think an obvious answer would be Goku. The same way you can&#x27;t do Naruto and not include the major players, Goku and likely Vegeta are sound bets. I&#x27;d like some less obvious characters too, like Piccolo, Bulma, or Yamcha, but those would probably be relegated to a second pack, much like some of the Naruto options were.
I&#x27;m hoping for some kind of in-game event as well, whether it&#x27;s another special map like the Hidden Leaf Village or possibly an in-game happening. King Kai willing, we get a Kamehameha weapon.
But I have to say, seeing some Dragon Ball content drop in Fortnite sounds pretty exciting. Growing up on Toonami instilled quite a bit of nostalgia for the series in me, and it was doubled, maybe even tripled, with the love letter that is Dragon Ball FighterZ.
So yes, I&#x27;m quite looking forward to August 16 and whatever it entails. Hopefully we&#x27;ll all be able to finally learn who would win in a fight, John Cena or Goku. We&#x27;ll just have to wait until next week to get that much closer to our answer.

If there is one thing my Apple Arcade subscription has taught me over the past few years, it’s that games designed around gacha mechanics don’t necessarily have to be the type of whale-hunting monstrosities that result in terrible YouTube “influencers” bragging about how they can’t play anybody online anymore because they spent $100,000 in it. Games like World of Demons and Star Trek: Legends are enjoyable gacha games in part because you don’t have menus popping up constantly goading you into dropping cash in them. With that monetary incentive removed from these titles, players are free to enjoy the actual gameplay without worrying they’ll miss out on something huge if they don’t buy a loot box or start a game-specific subscription service.

Marco and the crew will be going on a tactical adventure a bit later than expected. Dotemu and Leikir Studio&#x27;s Metal Slug Tactics is delayed, and now aiming for a 2023 launch.
In a statement on social media today, Dotemu says the team needs a little extra time.
&quot;Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make Metal Slug Tactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023!&quot;
The news also came with a new piece of artwork, which is at least pretty rad.

All&#x27;s fair in love and tactics
The combination of SNK arcade series Metal Slug and a healthy heaping of tactics was revealed during last year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest kick-off stream. Made in partnership with SNK, the game&#x27;s a collaboration between Leikir Studio and well-known makers of arcade-style games and retro revivals, Dotemu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;DqF0KLsaf6U
The new Tactics entry will follow Marco and the gang through battle after battle. It&#x27;s got the distinct Metal Slug look, but from an isometric, Into the Breach-style perspective. Metal Slug Tactics will also apparently have some perks and skill trees to work with, though we haven&#x27;t seen too much of the actual game at this point. The project&#x27;s been largely quiet, aside from a trailer or two.
I&#x27;ve dumped countless quarters into Metal Slug machines over the years, and I&#x27;m a big fan of tactics games, so I&#x27;m primed to dig this one. Dotemu has built up some goodwill over the years too. While I was hoping to get hands-on with Metal Slug Tactics this year, we&#x27;ve not been hurting for good strategy games in 2022 anyways. Pushing Metal Slug out to 2023 only means we&#x27;ll have even more tactics to look forward to next year, too.

Mobile game developer Huuuge Games has proudly announced that it has smashed its &quot;Wish 200 Week&quot; fundraising event, with a grand total of around $490,000 USD raised for the UK Make-A-Wish Foundation, the non-profit organization that facilitates dream requests for critically ill children.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Wish 200 Week, which took place between July 18-22, saw Huuuge Games partner with numerous publishers, developers, and streamers to engage in five days of fundraising efforts. British studio Hutch and Swiss browser game builder Miniclip were also involved in the event, the second of which to be held within the past two years.
&quot;We are extremely proud that the united gaming community came together once again to help Make-A-Wish UK with their Wish 200 Week, with this donation a lot of ill children and their families will see their gaming dreams come to life,&quot; said Huuuge Games co-CEO Rod Cousens in a press release. &quot;Gaming is a big part of young people’s lives and we know how it can be a great escape from the troubles of real life. We are especially glad that 200 children in need will have their gaming wishes granted with our help.&quot;
All of the money raised will go directly to Make-A-Wish UK, where it will be used to fund the wishes of 200 children. For more details on the work done by Make-A-Wish UK, visit the official website.

                              <span>The overview video goes over quite a bit
If you were curious about checking out the new entry, this Saints Row trailer (which hit YouTube this week) should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.
Taking place in Santo Ileso (which is an amalgamation of the American Southwest), you&#x27;ll join up with your in-game buddies (Neenah [get-away driver], Eli [behind-the-scenes assistant], and Kevin [on-the-field partner]) as well as your out-of-game-buddies (with co-op) to reform the Saints in this new reboot universe. Amid commentary from in-universe characters, this six-minute Saints Row trailer walks you through the core concepts: creating your criminal empire, and exploring Santo Ileso. Even if you aren&#x27;t interested in the story at all, the trailer does a pretty good job of showcasing general mechanics, like the customization options, side mission activities, and modes of locomotion (including gliding).
It&#x27;ll be really interesting to see the audience reaction here. Based on my prior hands-on I really dig the world map, but the general vibe and tone are going to hit differently depending on what kind of Saints Row fan you are. After all, the series has kind of been all over the place on that front, and it&#x27;s really hard to top the prior &quot;aliens/superpowers/hell&quot; combo. Rebooting and resetting made perfect sense.

                              <span>PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch ports revealed
Red Art Games has announced that frenetic, bullet hell shmup Shinorubi will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in early 2023, alongside the official release of the PC edition — which is currently available via Steam Early Access.
Shinorubi spins a tale of a precious mineral, known as &quot;R-R.&quot; This mineral, which grants incredible power and longevity, has been greedily hoarded for over a thousand years by the aristocratic BAÄA family and its ruler, King R.LOYD III. However, legend tells of a coming solstice that will afford the opportunity to topple the rule of BAÄA, and, with the fateful day approaching, eight rebellious members of the king&#x27;s own army plan to wrest the power from the family&#x27;s grasp, once and for all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UEBPGROX3UY
The first title from shmup-lovin&#x27; studio Last Boss 88, Shinorubi is a vertically scrolling danmaku that hopes to put even the most veteran bullet hell fans to the test. Offering up eight unique characters — each with their own distinct playstyle — players will blast their way through waves of enemy vessels before squaring off against the king&#x27;s own private army of generals, led by his ruthless daughter, Nemesis. Shinorubi will offer up multiple difficulty settings, an array of arrange modes, and 4K/120fps visuals on PS5 and Xbox Series X.
Shinorubi launches in early 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. It is available right now on Steam Early Access. Physical editions are currently in the works, with details to follow at a later date.

                              <span>New stages, new catalog and weapons every three months, and X battle and league battle
Post-launch, Nintendo is doling out Splatoon 3 free updates, just like they have with prior games in the series. They said as much in the Nintendo Direct this week, but thanks to a Nintendo UK tweet, have more details on what they&#x27;re actually doing with the threequel.
As expected, we&#x27;re getting a new catalog of items and weapons every three months. During the Direct, Nintendo explained that like prior games, the world of Splatoon will be shifting and evolving over time, especially when it comes to style. Hence, a new set of threads and other outfits will be introduced alongside weapon rotations (kind of like Fortnite and other shooters). New stages are also going to be part of that plan, adding onto the 12 stages that will be present at launch. Nintendo also promises battle and league battle updates.
Get ready to get sucked back into Splatoon 3 for a while
There&#x27;s also the strong possibility that the card game mode could be updated as well, on top of Salmon Run. At this point, Splatoon 3 has quite a bit to do, and for me, the card game was the tipping point. I mean odds are you probably won&#x27;t dig every mode in Splatoon, but now with more of them thrown at you, it&#x27;ll be hard to deny the siren&#x27;s song of all of them. Plus, that three-team Splatfest concept sounds like it&#x27;ll be pure chaos.

                              <span>Hot ninja tag-team action
Warner Bros. has released a new trailer for the next installment in its animated movie series Mortal Kombat Legends. Headed to Blu-ray and streaming services at some point in the future, Snow Blind is the third film in the series, following 2020&#x27;s Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge and 2021&#x27;s Battle of the Realms.
Snow Blind will focus on one of MK&#x27;s most noble heroes, the blind swordsman Kenshi, presenting the origins of the martial arts master&#x27;s journey to be one of the most feared and most formidable foes to anybody on a Wi-Fi connection. We will learn of Kenshi&#x27;s sight loss, and see his rigorous training to hone the mysterious and supernatural skills harnessed within him. Kenshi will then sally forth against an oppressive alliance of Black Dragon villains, led by the self-appointed King Kano.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vvqx3-1G9Rw&amp;t
The film will chart Kenshi&#x27;s rise to martial arts mastery, and see him unleash his newfound powers on a bevy of MK villains, including Black Dragon members Kabal, Kira, Erron Black, and even the poor-man&#x27;s-Ken, Kobra. The odds are against him, but it seems Kenshi isn&#x27;t alone, with a particularly icy ally waiting in the wings. Snow Blind will feature all of the melodrama and R-rated, blood-gushing action of the previous films, and it&#x27;s cool to see some of the more forgotten &#x27;00s characters get some time in the spotlight.
Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind will premiere on Blu-ray and streaming services in the future. The two previous films — Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge and Battle of the Realms — are both available now.

                              <span>The full performance is on YouTube
Nintendo said that a Kirby 30th Anniversary Music Fest stream was coming (with a live audience in Japan) and it&#x27;s here! You can watch it below.
The stream actually debuted on YouTube roughly four hours ago in the US morning of August 11, and the entire thing is available to watch now from start to finish. The crew goes through the entire series with a wide variety of instruments, and the stream occasionally has a box in the corner to showcase what&#x27;s on-screen (typically gameplay of the level/scene involved, as is common with many video game live concerts) while the camerawork zooms in and out on the musicians.
Like the Sonic stream before it, it&#x27;s a fun little way to spend an afternoon, especially if you&#x27;ve been missing live music (as a small note, the dialogue is in Japanese, outside of Kirby very cutely saying &quot;bye bye&quot; at the end). Honestly? We need more of these! The Genshin Impact team has done a pretty good job of keeping this dream alive, but more publishers getting involved is a good thing. Especially if it actually has 30 years of history to draw upon like the Kirby 30th Anniversary Music fest.

                              <span>Yeah, I guess this is something I do now
When we last left Forspoken, the jury was still out on it, and it was delayed into 2023. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic for some parts of it. But now it&#x27;s time for Forspoken&#x27;s quippy dialogue to really face the music.
A lot of prospective fans have been waffling on the dialogue since it was announced, which can definitely teeter into the realm of overly-edgy. A new tweet this week from Square Enix, which showcased some gameplay and reminded us of the January 2023 release date, didn&#x27;t instill much confidence that things have improved.
Alright, so here&#x27;s the official Forspoken tweet:
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1556679378892898306
&quot;So let me get this straight&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m seeing freaking dragons&quot;
&quot;And oh yeah I&#x27;m talking to a cuff&quot;
&quot;Yeah OK that is something I do now!&quot;
It&#x27;s essentially a 2022 version of &quot;record scratch: so you&#x27;re probably wondering how I got myself into this situation,&quot; right? While the narrative can still deliver, I&#x27;m not sure I can stand to listen to the constant quips. And this is before the game is out!
Various content creators have taken to roasting the promo, including the following choice videos:

https://twitter.com/bobvids/status/1557164035250032641
At what point do people slide down the volume on Forspoken&#x27;s quippy dialogue? I guess we&#x27;ll find out on January 24, 2023.
[Update: More parody videos have popped up since initial publication. You can watch them below.]

                              <span>Raiders of the Lost Arcade
I miss the days when I could still stumble across arcades. A few machines tucked away next to a food court or in a train station. They were the most impractical of ways to play games. They were expensive, noisy, and sometimes just plain broken. However, I feel that an arcade cabinet gives its game a life of its own. This is Metal Slug. It lives in this bowling alley. Not a chunk of plastic on the wall, but a living monolith. Gosh, I even miss the Cruis’n USA that was in Pizza Hut.
It’s funny that the last safe place to experience an arcade is within a video game itself. We’ve had compilations lift the aesthetic and a few indie titles that try to capture that nostalgia, but Arcade Paradise is something unique. It tries to take you back to that time, only without t…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s out this summer
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet was just announced this morning, without a Nintendo Direct or anything! It&#x27;s a four-player game that&#x27;s set to release &quot;this summer,&quot; and will feature a core focus of racing through obstacle courses.
Since it&#x27;s all the info we have at the moment, here&#x27;s the full rundown of Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet from Nintendo:
&quot;Roll through a smorgasbord of food-themed stages in 4 rounds of 4-player fun as Kirby…who seems rounder than usual? Race through delicious obstacle courses to collect strawberries as Kirby grows. Then, turn the tides in the final round—a fruity fight atop a floating platform. Roll through delicious, food-themed obstacle courses in 4-player matches Collect strawberries to grow bigger and prepare for the final battle. Kirby’s Dream Buffet offers easy-to-understand gameplay for players of all skill levels, but also presents a healthy challenge for those looking to satiate their craving for friendly competition.&quot;

Local and online play are in, but note the proviso for local multiplayer, right on the game&#x27;s official site: &quot;Additional games and systems required for multiplayer mode. Sold separately.&quot;
You can find the Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet listing here. That makes two Kirby games this year! Typically the fluff ball manages to knock out a ton of spinoffs these days, so this isn&#x27;t as big of a surprise, but it&#x27;s a welcome one regardless. I&#x27;m getting a sort of Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course vibe with the rolling around, and it seems like there&#x27;s a bit of Fall Guys influence there too.
[Update: Nintendo has confirmed a relatively-surprise-oriented-drop for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet today on August 11, as it will be arriving in less than a week on August 17. It&#x27;s priced at $14.99.]

                              <span>The one good thing in England right now
Merchandising mayhem will reign in just a few short days from now, as The Pokémon Company opens the doors of the wildly popular retail outlet The Pokemon Center London. In hopes of avoiding the utter chaos of 2019&#x27;s event, the outlet has now opened its timeslot reservation service for interested parties.
If you are looking to visit The Pokémon Center London next week, then head on over to the reservation website right now and book your attendance slot. You&#x27;ll need to know what day and time you will arrive, as well as how many people will be in your group. This somewhat strict system is a necessity, given that the previous pop-up store appearance drew daily queues of over five hours, with over 30,000 customers walking the floor in a mere five days.
https://twitter.com/PokemonNewsUK/status/1557643837538975744?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;zoUr61e24OIWVaKlC9YLSQ
The new Pokémon Center London is being established in conjunction with the Pokémon World Championships, which are being held at London&#x27;s ExCel Centre between August 17-21. The store will feature a bonanza of Pokémon toys, accessories, and associated junk, along with photo opportunities and special themed areas. For this year&#x27;s event, the center exclusives are cute plushies of Pikachu and Roserade in Beefeater outfits, (the official uniforms of the guards at the Tower of London). These toys will, unsurprisingly, sell in double-quick time, so move fast.
If you want to just turn up on the day, that&#x27;s fine too, as you will be assigned a slot in a virtual queuing system. But, given the popularity of the store, the merch on offer, and the fact that all of the hardcore Pokeheads will be in town for the tournament, it is best advised that you pre-book your reservation today.
The Pokémon World Championships kick off at London ExCel August 17.

Sony shared the new games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in August for Extra and Premium subscribers, and I hope you like Yakuza or are willing to give it a chance. Heavily discounted as they often are, the Yakuza games rule, and Yakuza 0, especially, is an all-time great video game — the kind that will sit with you for years.
It feels strange to call Monopoly Madness a hidden gem, but it is. Take a chance on it.
Here&#x27;s the full lineup, which some of you might find disappointing.

                              <span>Storm the DioField today
Square Enix and Lancarse&#x27;s strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle has a demo, and it&#x27;s available right now. The upcoming game has an introductory demo live now on digital storefronts for PC and console.
The demo kicks off right at the opening of the game, and up through the first chapter. Save progress will carry over from the demo into the full version of The DioField Chronicle.
You can find it here on the PlayStation Store for PS4 and PS5, the Microsoft store for Xbox Series X|S and One, on the eShop for Nintendo Switch, and on PC via Steam.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;16eW4pAJUKU
The DioField Chronicle is a strategy RPG following a band of mercenaries, caught up in the war and machinations of the politicians around them. A core group of heroes tries to navigate shady dealings and plots while trying to effect change for the better, especially on the island nation of DioField.
Keeping three moves ahead
I got the chance to check out The DioField Chronicle early, and played this section in particular. You can find my full impressions here, but I came away surprised by how different it felt.
This year is not exactly wanting for tactical RPGs, with new entries like Triangle Strategy and the revival of classics like Tactics Ogre and Front Mission providing ample fodder for strategy fans. The DioField Chronicle stands out by taking a real-time strategy spin on the RPG concept, allowing units to move in real-time on the field.
Mix in some interesting class variations and some tight, well-designed arenas to fight in, and it all works pretty well. The player can even retreat to a home base and chat with allies, build up base buildings, and purchase upgrades, in a very Fire Emblem: Three Houses manner.
If you like a little strategy mixed into your RPG, it&#x27;s worth giving a shot. The DioField Chronicle demo is out now, and the full game is out on September 22.

                              <span>FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode will follow previous games by including loot boxes, EA have confirmed. In the past few years, several studies have linked loot boxes with gambling, and several European countries have moved to regulate them. In a statement given to Eurogamer, EA said that Ultimate Team packs are &quot;a part of FIFA that players love&quot; and that &quot;Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair.&quot;

                              <span>This is a bit different from what we normally cover, but I was going to order this for myself and thought it might be of interest to you, dear reader, as well. Anyway, you can get ten years&#x27; worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that&#x27;s a nice little savings - and of course it&#x27;s far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

                              <span>The Crucial X8 is our favourite portable SSD, thanks to its compact protective frame, convenient USB-A or USB-C connection and excellent performance. It&#x27;s capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it&#x27;s dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

You can&#x27;t deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You&#x27;re okay.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port&#x27;s development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we&#x27;ve decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It&#x27;s an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

The Splatoon 3 Direct was full of juicy info to get us ready for the upcoming squid shooter sequel, which will be released on September 9th. But like all good Nintendo fans, we weren&#x27;t watching the Direct just for the game updates, oh no, we were also on the hunt for Nintendo Easter eggs.
One such callback came in the form of an extended reach into the company&#x27;s past. Harmony, the overseer of Splatsville&#x27;s new general store, Hotlantis, can be seen playing with a Nintendo Ultra Hand — an extendable grabber toy that was manufactured by Nintendo back in the 1960s.

                              <span>Lamb do the slaughter.
Devolver Digital&#x27;s latest game in their stables of gory, bizarre, and irreverent releases is Massive Monster&#x27;s Cult of the Lamb, a game so perfectly-pitched to the Devolver crowd that it&#x27;s hard to believe it wasn&#x27;t an in-house project. It&#x27;s a cult simulator, but with cute li&#x27;l woodland animals instead of bloodthirsty human-types or Cthulhuses (although you can get a Cthulhu skin as part of a pre-order bonus, actually), making all the ritual sacrifice and cannibalism look so cuuuuuuuute.
That combination of cutesy and culty is the culmination of many, many months prototyping and flinging ideas at the wall in Massive Monster HQ, but now that the game is out, it&#x27;s receiving reviews that make all that work worthwhile (our review is coming soon, don&#x27;t worry — PC codes were sent out earlier than Switch ones!).

Disney&#x27;s Robin Hood was never given an official tie-in video game, but if it ever did, then we would hope that it would look a little something like Of Blades &amp; Tails, an action-oriented turn-based RPG which will be coming to Switch next year.
The top-down pixelated RPG market is a tough industry for games to stand out in, but in how many other RPGs do you get to play as a fox with a sword? You will play as Reik, a well-respected member of the fox tribe who journeys across a fantastical land inhabited by a host of different animals. Expect hack-and-slash combat in a turn-based format as you either follow the main story or search for treasures in dungeons.

If you&#x27;re the kind of gamer who prefers pigs to punches and geese to guns, you&#x27;ll no doubt have experienced what we&#x27;re going to call the Material Bottleneck. Whether you&#x27;re adding fences to your field in Stardew Valley or trying to figure out where to put your compost bin in Rune Factory, your lack of building materials — wood, stone, iron — can really put a halt to any plans you might have had. And what are you supposed to do? Let your cows roam free?!

Nintendo&#x27;s August Splatoon 3 Direct was jam-packed (or should that be ink-packed?) with new stuff, announcements, sneak-peeks and more for the upcoming splat-shooter, and if you missed it — or just need a refresher on what was announced — then we&#x27;ve got you covered, li&#x27;l squid!
(Update: We&#x27;ve just added even more info from the Splatoon 3 website that wasn&#x27;t covered in the trailer. Booyah!)

BioShock: The Collection made waves when it first arrived on Switch, and now this fantastic first-person package is available on the Nintendo eShop with a tasty 80% discount.
Rather than paying the full £39.99 for the celebrated three-game collection, the current Switch eShop sale (Europe only at the moment — apologies to our Stateside friends!) brings the price down to £7.99 for the remastered trilogy. That&#x27;s right, £7.99 (or €9.99 in the ol&#x27; Eurozone) for three of the best shooters on Switch or anywhere else for that matter. The games are on sale individually, too, although at £6.39 a pop you may as well snap up the lot.

If you really can&#x27;t wait much longer, then Soccer Story from publisher No More Robots might just be able to fill the void.

As if the Kirby 30th anniversary music festival and release date announcement for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet wasn&#x27;t enough pink puffball content for one day, the event also revealed the early 2000s anime, Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, will receive the HD remaster treatment.
The release of the new Blu-Ray edition of the anime is currently only announced for Japan, though we remain hopeful that a wider release will be confirmed before the end of the year.

One of our favourite surprises during last year&#x27;s E3 was the reveal of Metal Slug Tactics. This twist on SNK&#x27;s popular Metal Slug series sees the side-scrolling shooter become a top-down, isometric strategy game. Plus it&#x27;s got some pretty stunning pixel art.
But today, publisher Dotemu has confirmed that the game — originally due to launch sometime this year — has had to be pushed back to 2023. The publisher took to Twitter along with French developer Leikir Studio to share the news.

Kyle Thompson, the solo developer behind the gorgeous, weird, and gorgeously weird metroidvania Sheepo, is back with a brand-new game for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and consoles called Islets, another hand-drawn metroidvania that had us at &quot;what if Hollow Knight, but cats&quot;.
You&#x27;ll play as Iko, a tiny, brave mouse who uses his rickety old plane to explore islands in the sky, separated from the land long ago after some long-forgotten calamity, hoping to try to find a way to restore the world. Thompson bills the game as &quot;wholesome&quot;, thanks to its themes of making connections with others and rebuilding the world anew.

                              <span>Not a wash out.
Have you ever wanted to turn your local laundromat into an arcade? For the three of you that have, boy do we have a game to recommend you. Created by Nosebleed Interactive, the same developer behind the well-received Vostok Inc., Arcade Paradise puts you in the role of Ashley, an inheritor to a run-down laundromat called King Wash. Tucked away in the backroom are a handful of arcade cabinets that Ashley soon realises could earn much more cash than laundering dirty clothes. Problem is, Ashley’s father – voiced Geralt of Riviera himself, Doug Cockle – has little faith in the arcade business, leaving Ashley to prove him wrong by buying new arcade games with the laundromat’s profits, slowly turning it into the hottest gaming spot the sleepy town of Grindstone has ever seen.
While this might not sound like the most exciting premise, Arcade Paradise has a couple of things going for it. First, the gameplay loop of managing a laundromat – transferring clothes between washers and dryers, picking up garbage, removing gum, unclogging the toilet – draws from other simulation games like Stardew Valley. You only have a limited time each day to get everything done before closing up, so time management becomes paramount. Pulling clothes from a dryer as quickly as possible awards you higher score, which comes with more profits to buy arcade cabinets with. And the cleaner the laundromat, the more people willing to spend money on the arcade games tucked away in the back, thus earning more money for more cabinets.

                              <span>Growlithe, Growlaugh, Growlove.
The Pokémon Company has once again put all other brands to shame with its demonstration of how to mark a store&#x27;s grand opening. Japan&#x27;s newest Pokémon Center has opened today in Okinawa, Japan, and alongside some official images of the fresh store, the company has also released an original animation, &#x27;Travelling Gurdy&#x27;, to mark the occasion.
If you have watched the video below, you might find yourself dabbing a small tear from your eye — join the club! The two-minute short shows an isolated Growlithe travelling through various regions in search of his friends. Realised in a watercolour 2D style, the animation appears different to the Pokémon anime that we have come to expect, but it is all the more heartwarming because of it.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s launching soon!
From publisher Humble Games, a chellenging souls-like Metroidvania has been confirmed to launch on Switch on September 27th. Developed by Black Mermaid, Moonscars sees you take on the role of Grey Irma, a fierce warrior who must overcome deadly opponents and build up his strength in a non-linear world where &quot;every death is a lesson learned&quot;. Definitely sounds quite familiar to fans of Dark Souls, doesn&#x27;t it!
Aesthetically, the game also shares some stark similarities to Blasphemous, which proved a hit with fans of the Metroidvania genre with its often brutal difficulty and mature themes. We&#x27;re definitely a fan of the overall vibe here, and if you&#x27;ve read a series of books called Malazan Book of the Fallen, don&#x27;t you think the protagonist kind of looks like the dark lord &#x27;Anomander Rake&#x27;? Look him up!

What was the best part of the Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct yesterday? The Splatfests? The card game? The locker room? Unsurprisingly, it seems to be Deep Cut, the game&#x27;s new musical hosts. They&#x27;re turning out to be a big hit despite replacing the Squid Sisters, but one particular member from this trio has stolen the internet&#x27;s hearts
Joining the Octoling Shiver and Inkling Frye is one very big manta ray — Big Man. We&#x27;ve never seen anyone happier to just exist, really. Big Man is a manta of few words; it seems the only word he can say is &quot;ay&quot; which is actually a stand-in for every single word imaginable because we then get a translation of what he&#x27;s truly conveying.

If there&#x27;s one thing that Switch fans crave (other than Breath of the Wild 2 news), it&#x27;s a new addition to the classic Paper Mario series. While we cannot offer you that as such today, Flynt Buckler Wakes the Sleepy Castle is certainly a move in the right direction.
Combining turn-based combat with a story book-inspired RPG adventure, the game looks set to fill a particularly Paper Mario-y shaped hole in our Switch catalogue. Developer Sleepy Castle Studio has announced that a Kickstarter campaign will be launching this Fall for a Switch release (which feels like the game&#x27;s obvious home), and are predicting a launch date of Q4 2023.

                              <span>Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it&#x27;s polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion&#x27;s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a &quot;comedy open-world RPG&quot; where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You&#x27;ll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

                              <span>For weeks now, leaks and rumors have pointed to a Dragon Ball Z collaboration happening with Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite. Now, such a crossover has been officially confirmed. 
Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, &quot;Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022.&quot; Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let&#x27;s be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we&#x27;ll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today&#x27;s overview trailer reveals that Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That&#x27;s exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby&#x27;s different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too).

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the ro…</span>

Reverse engineering has been happening for the Apple Silicon graphics processor, early experiments being carried out under macOS and Asahi&#x27;s m1n1 environment, and the next step will be to start writing a Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) kernel driver.

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd. Huzzah.

Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off.

It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

                              <span>They say you shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover, but when the book in question has been written by Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro and is entitled &quot;Dear Ambivalence: The Mustachioed One, The Witches, And The Suspended Body&quot;, you can be absolutely sure I&#x27;ll be adding it to my enormous &#x27;to be read&#x27; pile as soon as I&#x27;ve finished typing. First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though. It sounds wild.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he&#x27;s inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.

                              <span>In Splatoon 3, the part-time party never stops
In today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct, we got a deep-dive on many of the modes coming to the next Splatoon. And one returning mode from Splatoon 2 is getting a few big upgrades, including one major one: it&#x27;s available any time, all the time.
For those who played Splatoon 2, you&#x27;ll remember that the co-op Salmon Run mode was a timed event. Special windows would be open only at set times to play the PvE mode.
Well, according to the Splatoon site, Splatoon 3&#x27;s Salmon Run mode is available any time. So yes, that means you won&#x27;t have to set a time and date for those part-time jaunts into Salmonid territory.
During today&#x27;s Direct, we also got a look at a few of the special enemies that will be causing problems for the Golden Egg collectors. These Boss Salmonids have special moves and weaknesses, like the barrier-popping, lid-dropping Slammin&#x27; Lid. Or the mortar-launching Big Shot, who seems like a big problem if left unattended.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aiuIZN0KDFQ
These new bosses add a little extra challenge, and on top of that, there are King Salmonids. According to today&#x27;s Direct, this special event can sometimes occur at the end of a job. You have to do as much damage as possible within a time limit to drive back the big bad, using special Golden Egg Cannons.
The Big Run is another special event that occurs once &quot;every few months,&quot; where Salmonids invade the city. Functionally, it looks like that means playing Salmon Run on regular Splatoon maps. It looks pretty exciting, but there is one update that&#x27;s big for any Salmon Run fan.
Don&#x27;t stop me now
Even more was shown off during today&#x27;s Splatoon 3 Direct, including new amiibo coming this holiday season and a special card game mode that&#x27;s being added to the action. It looks like next month is going to be one heck of a dive back into the inky world of Splatoon.
Splatoon 3 will launch on September 9 for the Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>GTA and Breaking Bad would be a match made in heaven
Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the best TV series of all time, and frankly, its subject matter would make for a great game. The show&#x27;s creator Vince Gilligan thought so too, because he at one point pitched a GTA-like adaptation of the iconic series. Originally reported by ComicBook, Gilligan expressed the interest he had in turning Breaking Bad into a game on a recent episode of his podcast &quot;Inside The Gilliverse,&quot; where he was accompanied by Eric Broadbent and Peter Gould.
Gilligan said that he&#x27;s &quot;not much of a video game player,&quot; but that he wanted to reach out to the studio that owns Grand Theft Auto and see if they could make &quot;like a module&quot; inspired by his series. Even for someone who doesn&#x27;t know games all that well, he might be onto something with a Breaking Bad x GTA DLC.
&quot;There have been quite a few attempts at video games,&quot; Gilligan continued. &quot;Some of them kinda sort of made it to market. We tried to do a VR experience with the Sony PlayStation VR headset. We did a mobile game that lasted for a little while.&quot; He&#x27;s referring to a narrative base-builder game that was released back in 2020 called Breaking Bad: Criminal Elements, but it didn&#x27;t last longer than a year.

Gilligan also shared the sentiment that the team behind Breaking Bad didn&#x27;t want to create a bad game that only drew players because of its association with the show, specifically referencing the colossal failure of the 1982 E.T. game for the Atari as something they wanted to avoid replicating.
I honestly find it impressive that conversations are still swirling about adapting Breaking Bad into a game — it speaks to the legacy the show has built nearly a decade after it went off the air.

Nintendo hosted a Splatoon 3 Direct today, detailing what&#x27;s to come in September. Alongside that news, it also launched a site for Splatoon 3 with even more info, including what rewards players with save data from Splatoon 2 will get in the new game.
According to the Splatoon 3 site, users who have Splatoon 2 save data can get a few different bonuses when they load up the third game. They range from equipment benefits to unlocking a few multiplayer settings earlier than others.
One of the Splatoon save data bonuses is three Gold Sheldon Licenses. These will let players access their favorite weapons immediately, without concerns about player level. So if you have a particular favorite from previous Splatoon games that you want to check out, you can grab …</span>

                              <span>One more round for Street Fighter V
Without hyperbole, it&#x27;s safe to say that Evo 2022 was a huge success — perhaps one of the greatest editions of the Evolution Championship Series ever, in fact. Returning in a physical capacity for the first time in years, fighting game fans were treated to hundreds of exciting matchups, some quality presentation, a fistful of exciting reveals, updates, and announcements, and some amazing in-ring action.
And the good times are set to continue, as it has been officially announced that Evo will be returning not only to western shores in 2023, but also in the east, as Evo Japan makes its own grand stage return next spring. The Japanese iteration of the event will take place at Tokyo Big Sight in Odaiba, Tokyo, for the weekend of March 31 — April 2. While a full card is yet to be announced, Arc System Works&#x27; Guilty Gear Strive, SNK&#x27;s The King of Fighters XV, Bandai Namco&#x27;s Tekken 7, and Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter V: Champion Edition are all confirmed to be in attendance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;T9I0GG0UR-k
The appearance of SFV on the main card is something of a curiosity, given that Capcom is looking at a spring 2023 release for its successor, Street Fighter 6. The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse is still betting on a February release, but one would imagine that such a launch date (March at the latest) would be just a tad too late to see the new fighter headline the Evo Japan card. Still, it&#x27;s quite clear that Capcom will want SF6 out in plenty of time to qualify for next year&#x27;s Evo USA, so the predicted date still stands.
Evo Japan will return in March 2023. Be sure to check out all of the fighting game headlines from the past weekend over in our round-up guide right here.

Indie outfit COWCAT has announced that its fun-looking point &#x27;n&#x27; click/brawler hybrid Brok the InvestiGator is almost ready to embark upon its first case. The animated adventure will come busting out on PC August 26, with a bevy of additional console ports scheduled for winter 2022.
Brok the InvestiGator is set in an alternative anthropomorphic universe and sees the down-on-his-luck boxer turned private detective eking out a living among the city&#x27;s more downtrodden and repressed denizens. However, a new case looks to shed new light on the life of Brok and his stepson, Graff, with spiraling events that may lead to answers about the tragic events that took the life of Brok&#x27;s wife and Graff&#x27;s mother. Break out the detective hat and knuckledusters — We got ourselves a mystery to solve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6JKf3uNTl4A&amp;t
As both Brok and Graff, players will embark upon a classic point-and-click adventure, conversing with the locals, solving puzzles, and gathering clues in order to progress the intriguing narrative. These investigative moments will be frequently interrupted by ne&#x27;er-do-wells, forcing our heroes to engage in bouts of down &#x27;n&#x27; dirty 2D brawler action, which makes for a fine mix of action, adventure, and mystery.
Packed out with a wealth of comic-style artwork, a fully-voiced cast of characters, and even multiple endings, Brok the InvestiGator is a very ambitious project from the young studio, and definitely worth keeping an eye on for those of the point &#x27;n&#x27; click, brawler, or furry persuasion.
Brok the InvestiGator launches August 26 on PC (via Steam and GOG). PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch ports will follow this winter.

We&#x27;re just a fortnight out from the launch of the super stylish-looking Shin Megami Tensei title Soul Hackers 2, which will launch on PC and console platforms come August 25 — and while the demon-hunting adventure hasn&#x27;t hit the streets yet, Atlus is already getting its DLC machine in gear.
On launch day, multiple paid DLC packs will be made available for Soul Hackers 2, comprised of additional music tracks, in-game costumes, extra in-game currency/items, and — perhaps a little more egregiously — a full alternate story chapter featuring a super-cool new devil summoner, Nana. Here&#x27;s a shocker: She has a sort of &quot;gothy/punky&quot; aesthetic, as do day one DLC characters for all video games in existence.
You can check out a Japanese trailer spotlighting all of the DLC below. More images are available over on the official Atlus Japan website.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H3QzKiFiVCE
There are four paid DLC packs in total. One featuring the extra character/scenario, one featuring a roster of additional demons, and one featuring a variety of character skins — including gear representing previous titles such as Persona 5, Shin Megami Tensei IV, and the original Soul Hackers, as well as the obligatory &quot;swimsuit&quot; wardrobe. Each pack can be purchased separately or in an &quot;All-in-One&quot; bundle for a discounted price of ¥4,840, or roughly $35 USD. Don&#x27;t shoot the messenger.
Soul Hackers 2 launches August 25 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Spider-Man PC is bringing the modern Insomniac classic to a wider market, just like God of War and several others did before it. The spice must flow, and so must ports.
What can be said about Spider-Man that hasn&#x27;t already been said? Well, not much! But this port is new.

Despite the déjà vu, I found myself getting lost in playing Spider-Man all over again — even though the purpose of this exercise was to mainly test performance. The intro says everything it needs to say about Peter Parker, then he quickly becomes Spider-Man, and we&#x27;re on our way with some organic tutorials on how to web-sling and get around.

Cult of the Lamb is what happens when snappy roguelite dungeon-crawling action meets freaky animal cult base building and management, and it&#x27;s a wild, intoxicating fusion.
It&#x27;s challenging to combine two very different genres in a cohesive way, making sure each half feels satisfying on its own while also fitting into the bigger picture, but the risk is often worth taking. And the developers at Massive Monster sure pulled it off. Straight away, it&#x27;s clear this is a tortured, sinister-yet-weirdly-cute world worth getting to know. But I was surprised by just how riveting the core &quot;slice and build&quot; loop ended up being.
We&#x27;ve played roguelites that wear out their welcome. We&#x27;ve sunk dozens of hours into town builders. …</span>

Mobile software company AppLovin has issued a proposal to Unity Technologies, offering to merge with the popular and highly widespread game engine creator for a staggering $17.5 billion USD buy-in rate. AppLovin made the offer public yesterday, with Unity Technology currently weighing up its options.
In order for Unity to accept the deal, it must first back out of its current agreement with another mobile-heavy software company, IronSource. IronSource and Unity announced their plans to merge a mere month ago, in a deal that would see IronSource become a subsidiary of Unity Technologies. AppLovin has requested the abolition of these plans as a key qualifier for its own merger proposal.
&quot;Over the last decade, we have built and operated a leading and innovative company in mobile app marketing and monetization solutions,&quot; writes AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. &quot;Unity is one of the world&#x27;s leading platforms for helping creators turn their inspirations into real-time 3D content. With the scale that comes from unifying our leading solutions and innovation that would be achieved with the combination of our teams, we expect that game developers would be the biggest beneficiaries as they continue to lead the mobile gaming sector to its next chapter of growth.&quot;
Should the merger go ahead, Unity CEO John Riccitiello — recently embroiled in the &quot;fucking idiots&quot; monetization controversy — would become joint CEO of the new company. In regard to new company stock, Unity shareholders would receive 55% of company shares, with 49% of voting rights shares. AppLovin believes that the merger will result in somewhere in the region of $500-700 million a year in the new company&#x27;s pre-tax revenue.

                              <span>It&#x27;s called Tableturf Battle
Thanks to a new Nintendo Direct, we have confirmation of a new Splatoon 3 card game called &quot;Tableturf Battle.&quot;
It&#x27;s a 1v1 competitive card battling game that you&#x27;ll be playing inside of Splatoon 3, similar to Triple Triad in Final Fantasy, or Gwent in Witcher 3. Battling is done by &quot;laying out cards,&quot; which create different shapes on the battlefield: then you&#x27;ll &quot;unleash&quot; a special attack in some fashion after crafting a calculated shape board state. Tableturf Battle will boast &quot;150 cards&quot; at launch to &quot;collect&quot; in-game.
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1557355548974137346
To kick it off you&#x27;ll talk to Sheldon in the Splatoon 3 hub (the Tableturf Battle Dojo in Splatsville to be precise), where you&#x27;ll presumably be gifted the &quot;starter deck&quot; that everyone gets by default. How players will earn future decks/cards is currently unknown, but it could be tied to the Tableturf Battle mode, or linked to other in-game activities like the campaign or versus.
Maybe this could become a standalone game one day? While nothing is guaranteed with Nintendo, that seems to be the case for a lot of other card-based spinoffs. If you want to see more, the Tableturf Battle sequence starts at roughly 16:00 in the Direct.

                              <span>Octoling (Blue), Inkling (Yellow), and Smallfry
Splatoon 3 amiibo? Sure! We have three more figures on the way thanks to a confirmation from the recent Nintendo Direct presentation.
Those figures are:
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
They join the current list of Splatoon amiibo, which is formidable at this point:
Inkling Girl (Smash series)
Inkling Girl (Orange)
Inkling Boy (Blue)
Inkling Squid (Green)
Callie
Marie
Inkling Girl (Green)
Inkling Boy (Green)
Inkling Boy (Purple)
Inkling Squid (Purple)
Pearl
Marina
Octoling Girl
Octoling Boy
Octoling Octopus
Inkling Squid (Orange)
Inkling Girl (Red)
According to Nintendo, the new trio is coming &quot;this holiday,&quot; but no further details were provided. Interestingly, amiibo news points out that different regions could be getting individual or 3-pack SKUs. Based on the US Nintendo Direct presentation, individual packs seem to be the default in that region.
Through the presentation, we know that there will once again be an amiibo case to visit to do amiibo-related things. But other than getting new outfits and &quot;posing with your amiibo&quot; for pictures, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot in terms of what each amiibo figure will actually provide, gameplay-wise.
It&#x27;s also very likely that we&#x27;ll get more amiibo for Splatoon 3 at some point, including the new &quot;core&quot; trio of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man. With Callie/Marie and Pearl/Marina setting the precedent, it seems like a good bet.
As always, here&#x27;s a full list of amiibo!

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game.

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter. 
Splatoon 3 leaves behind Inkopolis in favor of Splatsville, which is out in the heart of the Splatlands. Splatsville is a growing city that has rece…</span>

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s patch 1.06 offers dozens of small tweaks that should make your journey across The Land Between just a little easier. The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and &#x27;path of least resistance&#x27; kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

                              <span>A lawsuit filed last year by several Hollywood studios and Netflix targeting illegal streaming veteran PrimeWire now resembles a war of attrition. As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement &#x27;HydraWire&#x27;. But despite the numerous hurdles, all signs point to the plaintiffs toughing the case out for as long as it takes.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we&#x27;ll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine&#x27;s Day and the second arriving in April.

The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega&#x27;s mascot.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you&#x27;ll soon find out, it&#x27;s anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that&#x27;s harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn&#x27;t). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega&#x27;s iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic&#x27;s iconic sneakers.
Those aren&#x27;t the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn&#x27;t Sonic&#x27;s first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.</span>

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns&#x27; turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That&#x27;s the best price we&#x27;ve seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

                              <span>Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD&#x27;s first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we&#x27;re now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it&#x27;s been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

                              <span>You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2&#x27;s first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I&#x27;m proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I&#x27;ve bested it. I should say &quot;we&quot;, as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie&#x27;s highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

I&#x27;ve crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that&#x27;s now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

                              <span>Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?&#x27; A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it&#x27;s always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There&#x27;s no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Twitter account states we&#x27;ll learn more information later and that it will take &quot;some time&quot; before the system is finished. 
While that&#x27;s bad news for those who don&#x27;t own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There&#x27;s no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:

August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

                              <span>SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that Juri will join the roster of Street Fighter 6 alongside newcomer Kimberly.


Returning competitor Juri is a “sadistic thrill seeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes,” according to PlayStation. She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. 
For example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are new special moves but “…</span>

SUSE zavedlo podporu ReiserFS před asi dvaceti lety, jako zřejmě jediná větší distribuce. V současnosti je ReiserFS prakticky neudržovaný. Nástroje, které Jeff spravuje, byly naposledy aktualizovány před pěti lety. Podobně je na tom ReiserFS 3 v jádře.</span>

                              <span>Pirate streaming sites have plenty of options when it comes to sourcing movies, TV shows, and live TV streams. But for some, however, cheaper is apparently better. Streaming portals offering channels from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. and HBO are using Twitch&#x27;s servers to save money, but it appears Hollywood has already launched an investigation and is hot on the trail.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

If you don&#x27;t know the name, it&#x27;s Hoyoverse&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play action-RPG which draws on their experience making Genshin Impact (and its many antecedents) but places those combat and RPG systems within a roguelike structure.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia&#x27;s unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game&#x27;s horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

                              <span>When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the &#x27;90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up&#x27;s Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art. You can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders go live at Arcade1Up&#x27;s official page.</span>

                              <span>I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!

The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery&#x27;s streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

                              <span>Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it&#x27;s important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Wisdom from those who have tried opening a restaurant informs you that it isn’t the easiest way to make money.

                              <span>Top-tier football league LaLiga and subscription TV platform Movistar Plus+ have won a joint lawsuit in Spain that allows them to block IPTV services until 2025 without needing permission from the courts. A second lawsuit won by Movistar Plus+ allows the TV platform to advise local ISPs of piracy-facilitating sites on a weekly basis and have them blocked within three hours.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

                              <span>Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today&#x27;s news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We&#x27;ve enjoyed Ooblets whenever we&#x27;ve checked in on it over the years, so it&#x27;s exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.</span>

                              <span>Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. 
The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.</span>

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way. 
But the genre’s bubble gum aesthetics often mask a darker side – one prioritizing profit over peopl…</span>

                              <span>Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg&#x27;s game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn&#x27;t be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef

Mochizuki&#x27;s tweet reads, &quot;There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said.&quot;
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the classic Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and it’s releasing in just over three months. 
More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.” 
While waiting for Tactics Ogre: Reborn to hit PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC this November, read our thoughts on the original in the Game Informer Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together review. Check out this Game Informer Replay segment on Tactics Ogre after that.

                              <span>The crossover brawler of our dreams, MultiVersus, is the fighting genre&#x27;s latest prize winner. From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games&#x27; debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that&#x27;s left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ&#x27;s first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick &amp; Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 &amp; the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you&#x27;ll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James&#x27; butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, &quot;I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I&#x27;ve come away impressed with what I&#x27;ve played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year&#x27;s Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you&#x27;d rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.</span>

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of my favourite monitors, and I picked one up from Amazon the last time it was discounted. This week the 32-in model has been discounted to a similar price, so I thought I should let you all know about it!

                              <span>We think the WD Black SN850 is the best PCIe 4.0 SSD, and it&#x27;s now on sale. £99 at CCL gets you the premium 1TB model with a heatsink, some £30 cheaper than Amazon.
This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

                              <span>Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics cards – their first real go at dedicated desktop gaming GPUs in modern times – are in a bit of a weird spot. If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

The newie is Turbo Golf Racing, which looks like Rocket League for minigolf and is hitting Game Pass on the very day it launches. Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>I&#x27;m back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I&#x27;ve brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we&#x27;d like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Apex Legends: Hunted is soon to release, and leading the charge is Vantage - the youngest Legend ever inducted (or abducted) into the Apex Games. Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

                              <span>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

                              <span>Throughout 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII&#x27;s Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren&#x27;t able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you&#x27;ve missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game&#x27;s launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.</span>

Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors. Barricade yourself inside the police station of your mind and watch the trailer below.

Watch the trailer below to see a more playful side to four of DBD’s serial killers, which isn’t something I ever thought I’d type.

                              <span>Puzzles are fun. Exploring floating islands is pretty boss too. That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

                              <span>4TB NVMe drives normally cost upwards of $400, but today you can pick up the new Crucial P3 for just $289.99 after a $60 discount at B&amp;H Photo. That&#x27;s incredible value, working out as just 7 cents per gigabyte, and marks a sea change in the affordability of NVMe SSDs. 
(By comparison, the same drive costs £348 in the UK - the equivalent of $423.)

It combines building futuristic fortresses with raiding them for life-giving genetic material, either solo or in two-player online co-op. Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight. Check on how the post-apocalypse is faring in the trailer below.

                              <span>Even if you’re not “into” PC gaming hardware, spend enough time in its orbit and you’ll eventually develop a healthy scepticism for a specific type of electro-trickery. The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

                              <span>The first developer update video of The Last Starship focused on combat, which I thought looked pretty swish. The second developer update video for Introversion&#x27;s space-everything game says, hey, this game isn&#x27;t about combat, and talks about user-made ships, mining vessels and, in an additional video, early player opinions of the playtest.

The platform muted a stream of a popular Spanish streamer who participated in a high-profile event. The game&#x27;s indie developers believe that there&#x27;s a copyright troll at work and advise gamers to stay away from emergency vehicles while they try to find a fix.

The order is the latest in a long line of anti-piracy actions in France, where fledgling regulatory body Arcom has added hundreds of domains to the country&#x27;s official blacklist in just a few months.

Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

                              <span>Right now a combination of a Box discount and an Ebay voucher code are making two MSI AiO liquid CPU coolers extremely cheap. The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

                              <span>With cancelled pre-order comes small discount. Isn’t that the motto of Spider-Man? Well, it’s close enough under the circumstances. Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL&#x27;s excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.
