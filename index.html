                    <span>HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is something that you kinda take for granted on consoles and TVs, because once you flick the switch it just happens, every time you use it, forever. On PC the technology has been a bit more complicated.

The Shin Megami series has always reflected the darkness and cruelty of the world we live in, offering a reminder that the odds are often stacked against us, and unfair circumstances can cause great loss. But it also captures the beauty of rising up against those daunting challenges to stand tall – even when things seem impossible, we somehow persevere. That’s what makes the Shin Megami Tensei franchise shine, but the road to these victorious highs is filled with demoralizing lows. Voluntarily putting your energy into something that requires extra fortitude, commitment, and patience may not seem that appetizing at first glance, but no game has made me feel the rush of victor…</span>

Super Impossible Road, a multiplayer racer that&#x27;ll have you hurtling through space, will launch on Nintendo Switch next month before its arrival on other consoles, it&#x27;s been confirmed.
Rogue Games&#x27; &quot;lightning-paced&quot; title will hit the Switch eShop on 9th December, priced at $19.99. The game offers a career mode, an endless mode, and multiplayer for two-to-four players, and all of these run at 60fps. That&#x27;s right, even the four-player split-screen mode runs at 60fps – something that even Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn&#x27;t manage.

Japanese veteran Nihon Falcom Corporation – also known simply as &#x27;Falcom&#x27; – has stated its intention to start developing Nintendo Switch software in-house, rather than farming it out to external companies.
The news was part of Falcom&#x27;s latest financial results briefing, which also revealed that the company has big plans to mark the 35th birthday of its popular Ys series.

                    <span>Have you noticed this yet?
Today sees the launch of Nintendo&#x27;s latest Game &amp; Watch system – yeah, we still can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re saying this in 2021 either – as the new Game &amp; Watch: The Legend of Zelda arrives on store shelves. It&#x27;s a cool little device with plenty of features, but there&#x27;s one little secret that Nintendo kept from us building up to its launch.
While your attention will no doubt be gobbled up by the system&#x27;s colour screen and the Zelda games included when your unit arrives, make sure to pop the console out of its casing and flip it over when you get the chance. On the back, and in the right lighting conditions, you should be able to see a glowing Triforce symbol, as shared by Nintendo Life reader @Ferdsigner:

                    <span>Mark Zelda&#x27;s 35th with this neat collectable.
Last year, Nintendo provided its fans with the perfect stocking-filler via its Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros. handheld, a neat tribute to the classic Game &amp; Watch range of LCD games that were so popular in the pre-Game Boy landscape of the early 1980s. That release was essentially created to celebrate 35 years of Super Mario, and this year, the company has returned to the concept with Game &amp; Watch: The Legend of Zelda.
The first Zelda outing on the NES was released in Japan in 1986, making 2021 the 35th birthday of Link, Ganon and Princess Zelda. Alongside Super Mario and Metroid, Zelda is one of Nintendo&#x27;s most popular and beloved franchises, so it makes sense for the Japanese veteran to focus on it for the next in its presumably regular series of Game &amp; Watch updates.

                    <span>The original Call Of Duty, released 18 years ago, was a game that gave a shit about the Second World War. To play it today (and you should, it remains excellent) is to experience fear, disorganization, confusion, and horror.

                    <span>Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew unveils the latest game to grace the cover of our magazine, Halo Infinite and details our time spent seeing Xbox&#x27;s flagship title in action. During The Playlist, Dan Tack raves about his nearly 15 hours playing Elden Ring ahead of this weekend&#x27;s network test, Marcus shares his Bright Memory: Infinite review impressions and Van Aken shares his initial impressions of Battlefield 2042 fresh out of a three-day review event. Fair warning, we talk about the opening moments of the Halo Infinite campaign, so spoiler warning ahead of the section.

                    <span>Far Cry executive producer, Dan Hay, has announced his departure from Ubisoft after working there for over 10 years. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Hay will officially be gone from the company behind Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, and Tom Clancy’s The Division, tomorrow. Ubisoft told VGC that Hay has not revealed what’s next for him, though.

If you’ve toyed around with the idea of creating a new controller in the Xbox Design Lab but were waiting for some old features to return, now is your time. That’s because Xbox has brought back rubberized grips and metallic finishes. Three new colors are available as well. 
“[We’re] excited to announce that rubberized grips and metallic finishes are returning to Xbox Design Lab with new color customization options, giving you even more combinations to choose from,” Xbox’s blog post about the announcement reads.

Nintendo tweeted the surprise announcement today that you can download the app from the Switch eShop. Now you can watch your streamer of choice play Animal Crossing: New Horizons or complain about the Nintendo 64 emulation on the online Expansion Pack. Given the lack of many popular streaming services on the eShop, such as Netflix, the fact that Twitch made the cut is a small miracle.

                    <span>If you preordered a Playdate handheld gaming device that was set to ship this year, you’re going to have to wait a little bit longer. 
Panic Inc. announced today that its first batch of Playdates originally set to ship in 2021 have been delayed to early 2022, citing a “critical battery issue” that was caught late in the process. As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.
“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” 
Panic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. 
For more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn&#x27;t the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch.

                    <span>Ubisoft has revealed the official release date for Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction. 
This news comes by way of Gematsu, which reports that Extraction will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Luna, and Stadia on January 20. Ubisoft has also revealed some more information about the game’s built-in features such as cross-play and more.

“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” 
Extraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms. Gematsu reports that two Buddy Pass tokens will come with each copy of Extraction. These tokens allow you to invite two friend to play it with you for 14 days for free. If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. 
Ubisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. 
Today’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January. While waiting for it to be released, read about how its old name was Rainbow Six Quarantine (you can probably guess why it was changed) and then check out Game Informer’s Rainbow Six Siege review after that.

                    <span>After revealing Spider-Man’s design ahead of his debut in Marvel’s Avengers, we now get our first look at him in action, albeit in cinematic fashion. IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.
For those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival.

Spider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.

Halo Infinite&#x27;s upcoming release marks an exciting time for Xbox fans the world over. The return of Master Chief is shaping up to be an exciting affair and we&#x27;re giving you a quick 4K look at the opening mission from 343&#x27;s latest adventure!
In this clip, we find John-117 fighting off the Banished, a familiar yet new group of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites that have found their way to the Zeta Halo and are wanting to use its power for their gain. This first level of Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, but we find Chief getting back into the conflict, f…</span>

Halo Infinite is a few mere weeks away, but you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to get a new look at campaign gameplay! Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure!
There&#x27;s a ton to unpack here, but we&#x27;re showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today&#x27;s video. Throughout Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign, you&#x27;ll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that&#x27;s saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game&#x27;s most treacherous bosses. There&#x27;s no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you&#x27;ll see in the footage above). 
While you&#x27;re giving the Banished hell, don&#x27;t forget to look around. In today&#x27;s gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game&#x27;s upgrade currency that will enhance Chief&#x27;s equipment, such as the Grappleshot. 
We also get to show off one of the game&#x27;s newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It&#x27;s a Banished weapon that feels like it&#x27;s in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.
This is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343&#x27;s latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more! Thanks for watching, and we hope you enjoy the coverage!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s campaign offers two distinct paths for players; it’s one of the biggest things setting the game apart from its predecessors. As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.
However, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before. After an i…</span>

                    <span>After years of waiting, Halo Infinite is almost here. On December 8, gamers around the world will once again step into the Mjolnir boots of Master Chief and fight their way across a massive Halo ring world. Ahead of the game’s arrival, we’re highlighting Halo Infinite with one of our biggest cover stories in years. We’ve got 20 pages of in-depth detail on Infinite’s campaign and multiplayer, alongside a wealth of interviews with the development team at 343 Industries that brought the game to life.

                    <span>A Switch port of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced during the Nintendo Direct that aired back in September, and finally, after a little over a month of waiting, it’s available for purchase. 
KOTOR was first released on the original Xbox and PC in 2003, and it was later ported to Mac, iOS, and Android devices by Aspyr Media, the studio now heading the PlayStation 5 and PC remake of the classic RPG. Due to Xbox’s overall backward compatibility support, the original version of KOTOR has been playable on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles. As of today, it’s playable on Switch.

                    <span>Expect a handful of cheats to be missing from Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. 
The GTA franchise is known for a lot of things, including cheats. These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. 
However, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. 
“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” 
USA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.
While waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.

Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an interactive cheesy sci-fi action movie, for better or worse. It boasts incredible – and wonderfully improbable – action sequences propelled by a story that barely qualifies as narrative. Infinite even has a run time that is comparable to some films. Unfortunately, Bright Memory: Infinite burns out before it fades away, peaking early and showing great promise before concluding sooner than expected.

                    <span>Naruto is to the anime community what Fortnite is to gaming – a cultural phenomenon with continuous levels of popularity and success. Naruto’s fluid animation, impressive world-building, and relatable heroes have inspired fans across the globe. At the same time, Fortnite is beloved for its constant content rollouts and unexpected crossovers, with Marvel and DC being primary sources of inspiration. However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together. According to a teaser Tweet, Naruto (Shippuden, to be exact) will ninja run into Fortnite next week. Believe it!

                    <span>Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.

                    <span>If you’re someone looking for a PlayStation 5 in time for the gift-giving season, or even before the end of March, it’s now going to be even harder. 
Buying a PS5 already feels like an arduous task. Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million.

Bloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. 
The PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. 
While waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues.

                    <span>Battlefield has always been the largest, loudest, and most chaotic multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the Texas of video games, and whether you love it or hate it, its bombast cannot be overstated. For better and worse, Battlefield 2042 continues this trend, offering a dizzying amount of on-screen explosions, firefights, and objectives to capture. The game’s 128-player matches and gargantuan maps guarantee dramatic moments – and some of my favorite gaming clips from 2021 – but there’s a thin line separating spectacle and confusion. 
There’s never been a Battlefield game released without Conquest, the signature mode which tasks two opposing teams to capture and defend objective zones across the map. The popular match format is alive and well, but honestly, it’s my least favorite w…</span>

                    <span>But where&#x27;s Doomguy?
Animist, also known as Yuto, is an animator who makes incredible stop motion shorts. We&#x27;ve covered their Kirby stop-motion before, but their newest creation — somewhat appropriately — is Isabelle from Animal Crossing: New Horizons making coffee. Even though Brewster can probably handle it just fine, Izzy.
The stop-motion video is around 35 seconds long, and shows the tiny mayor&#x27;s assistant grinding her own beans with the help of a few tools to get her up to the top of the grinder.

                    <span>Grand Theft Oh No.
Well, Grand Theft Auto is finally on the Nintendo Switch! It&#x27;s just what we always wanted, right?
The Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition (yeah, that&#x27;s the full title) includes Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, as well as quite a few changes, which a lot of fans aren&#x27;t best pleased about.

                    <span>A bullet hellish experience.
Heaven&#x27;s Machine is the first of Super Rare Games’ ‘Super Rare Shorts’ series; brand new indie games only released on the Switch in physical form and only available to buy during a short open preorder window. It&#x27;s certainly an unusual idea but, unfortunately, this is probably not the start they were hoping for.
Heaven&#x27;s Machine is a twin stick controlled action roguelite filled with guns set onboard a heavenly train — so far, so promising. However, it will kill you off very quickly if you try to play it like a twin stick controlled action roguelite filled with guns set onboard a heavenly train. Rush in guns blazing and you’ll soon discover that, due to the spread of bullets onscreen and often tight areas, your short dash is just as likely to get you into trouble as it is out of it. Getting hit seems to offer no grace period whatsoever: if four bullets are overlapping when they hit you, you get hit four times.

                    <span>But there&#x27;s good news, too!
It seems like logistical difficulties are the hot issue right now, as it&#x27;s not just the Steam Deck launch that&#x27;s been postponed — the tiny yellow Game Boy-like, Playdate, is also going to miss its planned release date.
In an update sent to all Playdate customers who&#x27;ve got one of the units pre-ordered, here&#x27;s how the Playdate team described the issue that caused the delay:

Editor&#x27;s note: This article discusses an audio-based character moment near the end of Metroid Dread. If you&#x27;re sensitive to spoilers, you may want to finish the game and come back to this article later...

For 15 years, Metroid Dread was just a rumor. Now, it’s real, it’s been out for over a month, and it’s fantastic. Samus Aran’s latest adventure is packed with just about everything a Metroid fan could ask for, from wild boss fights to a massive labyrinthine map.

Super Rare Games has announced Heaven&#x27;s Machine as the first title in its &#x27;Super Rare Shorts&#x27; series of physical-only Switch games.
The game is &quot;a chaotic, fast-paced roguelite set on a cosmic train racing towards heaven&quot; developed by Glass Revolver, the studio behind ITTA and House of God. In the game, you&#x27;ll take on the role of Jack, exploring a randomly-generated train as you grab items, blast away enemies, and battle monsters.

We still don&#x27;t have Netflix on the Nintendo Switch, but now we&#x27;re one step closer to being able to use it as a viewing platform as well as a game one, because Twitch just launched on the Nintendo Switch eShop.
The streaming platform is already on other consoles, like the PS4, PS5, and all the various Xboxes, but now the Switch is joining in, over four years after launch.

                    <span>&quot;Missing parts along with logistical challenges means delayed Steam Decks&quot;.
Valve has announced that shipping of Steam Deck, the company&#x27;s Switch-like handheld PC, will be delayed by two months due to &quot;global supply chain issues&quot;.
In industry-wide circumstances that recently caused Nintendo to reduce its Switch sales forecasts due to the global semiconductor shortage, Valve explained on the Steam Deck reservation page that, despite factoring in the ongoing supply chain woes, its plans have still been disrupted.

If you still find yourself craving some new Nintendogs-style gameplay – seriously, what&#x27;s happened to that series, Nintendo? – you might want to consider Pups &amp; Purrs Animal Hospital which launches on Switch today.
From Aksys Games, the game has you becoming &quot;the very best veterinarian ever!&quot; You see, rather than looking after your animals at home, Pups &amp; Purrs Animal Hospital is unsurprisingly set in a hospital where you&#x27;ll be tending and caring for some fluffy but poorly friends.

BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light (£49.99 / €59.99) - As the last summer day fades, all is illuminated. With gorgeous translucent designs by Mel Kishida, as well as a story that depicts the youth of lifelike girls, based on a theme of human identity and bonding, a new title in the BLUE REFLECTION series is here! Story Under a piercing blue sky, surrounded by crystal clear water, the sun scorched Ao Hoshizaki&#x27;s skin. Gazing at the summer scenery, it seemed as if the girl was left behind in a world that she had wandered into. At a school adrift in the distance, there lived three girls who had lost their memories. The only thing they could remember was their names. Ao, shrouded in confusion, begins to lead a strange communal life with the girls as they seek clues about a way to return to their original world. One day, in this world where the school was surrounded by nothing but water, a path that led to new scenery suddenly appeared. At the end of the path was a mysterious location, where familiar things existed inexplicably. - Read our BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light review

                    <span>One goal is to &quot;protect creators from harassment&quot;.
It&#x27;s fair to say that the incredible growth of the internet and in particular social media has changed its feel a great deal over the years. So of us are old enough to remember when the web was a rather quirky and surprisingly friendly place, but its all-encompassing presence in modern life now leaves websites and social media networks grappling with a variety of factors. How do you support &#x27;free speech&#x27; but protect people from harassment and bigotry? How do you encourage honest feedback but shutdown the viral trend of review bombing and sustained downvoting campaigns?
In the video above YouTube confirms that, rolling out gradually from today, it&#x27;ll address part of the challenge by hiding the dislike &#x27;count&#x27; on videos. The button will still be there, and disliking content will still influence your recommendations (and likely have some impact on the site&#x27;s algorithm, but that&#x27;s a bit of speculation on our part), but the count won&#x27;t be shown to the public. Creators will still be able to see it in their analytics, though, should they want that data feedback. If you&#x27;re feeling cynical, too, hiding it from public view may also allow YouTube to sell the data to external marketing agencies in the future.

Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain is just weeks away from launching on Switch, and Nintendo&#x27;s busy convincing us to pick it up with a brand new commercial starring Neil Patrick Harris.
The How I Met Your Mother actor, who&#x27;s also starring in a Nintendo-themed holiday film this year called 8-Bit Christmas, is seen enjoying a game or two with his family. As we imagine plenty of parents will relate to, he&#x27;s forced to sneak in some practice to take on his kids – how are kids so good at these games, anyway?

Famitsu&#x27;s Japanese chart figures are now in for the week ending 7th November, revealing that Mario Party Superstars has remained at number one for a second consecutive week.
The game shifted another 81,399 physical copies this week, down from 163,256 at launch, and managed to comfortably keep Call of Duty: Vanguard from stealing its position at the top of the chart. Danganronpa Decadence was the highest-charting new release on Switch this week, selling 20,938 physical units.

That&#x27;s where new iteration Pokémon TCG Live comes in, although you&#x27;ll have to wait a while longer for it than intended, as it was announced today that its open beta has been delayed until 2022.

FFI through IV have all come out over the past year, with IV landing back in September. Now Final Fantasy V has joined the party, letting you play the classic RPG with more faithful artwork than the derided mobile ports that were available previously.

They look fancier and more modern (the originals being from 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively), and have control schemes which are less damn old. Unfortunately, they have also cut some of my favourite songs from the radio, boooo.

We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.

                    <span>One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

                    <span>This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

                    <span>The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

                    <span>It&#x27;s Skyrim&#x27;s 10th birthday today, so Bethesda have released yet another version of their epic fantasy RPG to celebrate. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is out now, adding a bunch of Creation Club content, like fishing, aquariums and more. Plus, owners of the game&#x27;s Special Edition will get a handful of freebies too. It&#x27;s no Elder Scrolls 6, but hey, fish are nice. So, how many copies of Skyrim will you own after today?

                    <span>If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

Nesmírně nás to mrzí, a i když jsme dělali vše pro to, aby se nás nedotkly problémy světového logistického řetězce, z důvodu nedostatku materiálu nám komponenty do výrobních středisek nepřichází včas, což v důsledku znamená, že nestíháme plánovaný termín vydání, píše společnost Valve v oficiálním oznámení.</span>

                    <span>If you’re excited to see if you gel with The Gunk, you won’t have to wait much longer now as Image &amp; Form Games have revealed its release date: December 16. 
The team behind the SteamWorld franchise first announced its upcoming exploration game, The Gunk, during the Xbox Games Showcase back in 2020. Image &amp; Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December.

Now, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. 
“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” 
As noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image &amp; Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  
While waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image &amp; Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase.

                    <span>Thunderful held a showcase today featuring upcoming games from the publisher including The Gunk (which holds a newly announced December release date) and the Stadia timed-exclusive aquatic adventure Wavetale, which releases today. Capping off the presentation was a brief look at the next chapter in the SteamWorld franchise, SteamWorld Headhunter.
The teaser (which you can watch below) features two robotic cowboys featuring spectacular &#x27;staches facing off in a familiar pistol dueling position. You know, desert town, high noon, and all of that. One automaton looks to have lost the shootout, and in the process, lost his head. When the victor checks on the deceased&#x27;s condition, only to find its head is detached and flying at him with deadly intent.

Thunderful isn&#x27;t saying much about Headhunter other than it&#x27;s a direct follow-up to &quot;the (literally) earth-shattering events of SteamWorld Dig 2&quot; and will be a full 3D, co-op action adventure experience. In honor of the announcement of Headhunter, SteamWorld Dig 2 is currently free to download on Steam and GOG starting today and lasting until tomorrow, November 11 at 11 a.m. Eastern.

                    <span>Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.
The delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here&#x27;s Valve&#x27;s announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:
It looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you&#x27;ve pre-ordered one already.
While it&#x27;s disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn&#x27;t a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. 
The Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor. You can read about the device from our story on the announcement, and you can check out our suggestions on the best games to play on Steam Deck here.</span>

                    <span>Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.
As you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. 
Spidey joins the fray via the free &quot;With Great Power&quot; hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it&#x27;s tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. 
For non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix&#x27;s disappointment in Avengers&#x27; performance here.

                    <span>Industry figure Geoff Keighley has revealed that his annual gaming awards show, aptly titled The Game Awards 2021, will feature somewhere between 40 to 50 games. 
This news comes by way of a news post by Epic Games about the awards show and in it, Keighley revealed that he learned from last year’s event that “games and the trailers” are what drive the show. He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. 
“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” 
Keighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. 
The Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. 
This year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. 
While waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition launches tomorrow, and we already have a pretty good idea of how Rockstar is enhancing GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. However, the publisher shared more specifics on the changes made to its classic sandbox titles.
We know the games look sharper than ever thanks to higher resolution textures, rebuilt lighting, an increased draw distance, among other perks. Rockstar revealed that PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players also benefit from a 4K resolution/60 fps performance. 
As previously revealed, the controls have been revamped to match Grand Theft Auto V’s. Shooting and targeting have been improved, including better drive-by controls for San Andreas specifically. You can also now immediately restart failed missions instead of being kicked…</span>

                    <span>October was a big month for video games in terms of releases. It saw new titles like Far Cry 6, Back 4 Blood, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and more hit the market. It’s no surprise that many of these debuts lead PlayStation’s top downloads for the month of October, either. 
PlayStation released the top October downloads for its multiple platforms today and at the number one spot in the United States and Canada is Far Cry 6, followed by FIFA 22 in second, and Back 4 Blood in third. On the EU side of things, it’s a touch different: to nobody’s surprise, FIFA 22 was the top download with Far Cry 6 in second and Back 4 Blood in third.

                    <span>If you’ve played any Pokémon game, the more open-ended post-campaign content is often just as enticing as the linear narrative. You defeat eight gym leaders, conquer the elite four (or whatever other monikers that a specific region might use), and then enter the annals of the Pokémon Hall of Fame. Beyond this, you might unlock a new area with challenge battles/scenarios, or, in the case of Gold and Silver, you travel to an entirely new region with its own trainers and points of interest. 
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will likely come with some impressive extra features after the credits roll. Moreover, a new trailer and press release revealed Ramanas Park, an endgame nature preserve of sorts where you can catch legendaries from across the entire franchise.

After yesterday’s official launch, the new open-world arcade driving game from Playground Games hit over 4.5 million players, according to Xbox head Phil Spencer. This makes the launch of Forza Horizon 5 bigger than any Xbox Game Studios launch before it.

                    <span>Remember the bubbling excitement surrounding Jump Force a few years back? Anime and brawler fans alike came together to either relive their favorite battles/fantasy fights across myriad series or embark on a new, ambitious fighting experience touting a sizable roster at release. I might not have purchased Jump Force when it launched back in 2019, but I remember throwing together A Short Bio Of Every Jump Force Character as a Game Informer intern. I was impressed with the sheer amount of licensed anime shows that were slated to appear in the game (and exhausted by the end of writing all those dossiers). However, early next year Jump Force’s digital availability and online services are coming to an end in the Americas.

                    <span>While many Linux users were excited years ago around EOMA68 and in part the possibility of an open, upgradeable laptop design, it has yet to ship and looking like it never will -- not to mention being very outdated specifications by today&#x27;s standards. Entirely unrelated to that prior upgradeable hardware effort but continuing in similar goals is The Framework Laptop. The Framework Laptop is a thin, upgradeable notebook that is Linux-friendly and allows the user to easily upgrade their own components. I was testing The Framework Laptop for a while and from the hardware perspective is a very nice device and running well under Linux.</span>

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. &quot;It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character&quot; is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.

                    <span>To hell with raytracing. Nuts to your HDR. And VR, more like Very Rubbish. No, the only future graphics technology which matters is pretty water. One of the few games to understand this is Sea Of Thieves, home to some of the prettiest virtuawater you ever did see, while so many others neglect their duty to show me pretty fake water. So today I&#x27;m delighted to see that the next big World Of Warships update brings a graphics overhaul including pretty new water. It is pretty! Not Sea Of Thieves-grade pretty, but certainly a better use of resources than goggles.

                    <span>Hello folks. I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

                    <span>Compared to many of the tabletop social deduction games which inspired it, Among Us is fairly straightforward. Goodies, baddies, and that&#x27;s it. Well, last night it took a step towards its roots with the addition of four new roles which can change how you play your character—and how you need to think about other people&#x27;s characters. Say hullo to the Scientist, the Engineer, the Guardian Angel, and the Shapeshifter.

                    <span>There’s this hip-hop track I’m a fan of called Money Dance by Rick Ross. It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there&#x27;s one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend&#x27;s PS5 (that I, err, &#x27;borrowed&#x27;, as sadly Elden Ring&#x27;s closed network test isn&#x27;t available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you&#x27;ll be able to experience everything I&#x27;m about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

                    <span>As part of their 35th birthday celebrations, Ubisoft are now giving away the Assassin&#x27;s Creed Chronicles trilogy free for keepsies on PC. You have until Friday to claim your copies of the spin-offs, which converted AssCreed&#x27;s sneak-o-murdering into 2.5D side-scrolling platformers. They told stories of three different assassins in China, India, and Russia across several hundred years, with art styles inspired by their setting. And right now they&#x27;re free.

                    <span>Unity, makers of the popular 3D engine of the same name, have announced they&#x27;re acquiring Weta Digital, Peter Jackson&#x27;s visual effects studio known for fanciness in films including Planet Of The Apes, Lord Of The Rings, Avatar, and The Suicide Squad. They plan to bring Weta&#x27;s tools to Unity developers, which is quite an arsenal to offer in the rendering arms race against Unreal Engine.

                    <span>Back in 2016 I spoke to game dev and critic Mattie Brice about making DIY video games for the young audience at Rookie Mag. Brice said, “I just wanna demystify to a lot of people that you don’t need this intense process to make video games.” While tools like Unity and Game Maker 2 have become more user-friendly over the years, the game making tool with the lowest barrier to entry might just remain Twine - the HTML-based text-centric dev tool that is often likened to a way to make electronic choose-your-own-adventure stories. The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

                    <span>Give players a grind to unlock goodies and earn money and, rather than play the game the way the developers might intend, they&#x27;ll likely figure out the laziest and most efficient way to accomplish that. In Forza Horizon 5, this involves buying janky Jeeps. So many Jeeps. Players have figured out that an endless stream of Willys Jeeps give them a cheap way to get big spins on the prizewheel, potentially winning big money and unlocking rare cars. The game is awash with Jeeps.

                    <span>Kubernetes je dnes nejrozšířenější platformou na hostovaní Docker kontejneru a je podporován velkými hráči na trhu (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) skrz Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kuberneres pro provoz používají všechny velikosti firem, od startupu po korporace. Pojďme se naučit jej používat na dvoudenním kurzu Úvod do Kubernetes, který proběhne v naší pražské školicí místnosti ve dnech 25. a 26. listopadu. Školení proběhne kombinovaně: tedy prezenčně a zároveň je možné se účastnit online.</span>

                    <span>There was a time when video games were largely linear affairs. You either moved up and down or from left to right in enclosed spaces. As technology evolved, so did the scope of digital worlds. Now players are regularly treated to expansive environments filled with quests, interesting characters, and horizons that stretch further with every console generation. These experiences consume dozens if not hundreds of hours, and as more of them flood the market, knowing which titles are worth the time investment has become crucial. To that end, we’ve assembled a list of 10 great modern open-world games available today to help make what can be a paralyzing decision a little easier. These are listed in no particular order and don’t necessarily represent the best games of all time. Rather, this will …</span>

I have never hated a game that I also find immensely fun, but somehow Riders Republic pulled this off. Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world action sports game begins with a promising premise: you, a voiceless action sports aficionado, arrive at Riders Ridge, a mecca for shredders everywhere. Somehow, against all laws of national parks and state regulations, multiple states&#x27; worth of national parks –  including Mammoth and Yosemite – have been reappropriated by the action sports industry for the explicit purpose of hauling ass. 
Rider&#x27;s Republic&#x27;s map looks about as great as any other Ubis…</span>

You’d be hardpressed to find someone who’s not at least heard of Among Us. An indie darling that especially blew up due to its ability to bring people together during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Among Us has continued to receive a steady flow of updates over the past year. The latest is the Cosmicubes update, and it’s now live on any platform where you can play Among Us.

“This is just to make money, isn’t it?” the update trailer cheekily asks. “Yup, we live in a capitalistic society – money for updates, server costs, team wages, survival, therapy, food, boba, and a new game.”…</span>

                    <span>The Happy Home Paradise DLC is out following a surprisingly packed Animal Crossing-centric presentation last month. This paid DLC, which Nintendo says will be the last for New Horizons, offers players a chance to take up a new profession as a vacation home designer. The experience costs $24.99 on its own, but if you pick up a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Happy Home Paradise comes bundled in for no extra cost. So, is the design life worth the Bells?
With several hours, multiple happy vacation home clients, and even a promotion under my belt, my biggest takeaway is that this expansion holds little for you if you don’t love designing spaces. If you are drawn to Animal Crossing to gather museum displays or strike it rich in the Stalk Market, Happy Home Paradise might not be for y…</span>

                    <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands&#x27; impending release next year means not only will Borderlands fans have a new game to dive into, but they&#x27;ll also have plenty of new merch to pick up and collect. Those who are partial to the Dungeons and Dragons-inspired Borderlands 2 DLC, Assault on Dragon Keep, and the expanded vision of that aesthetic in Wonderlands will have plenty to look forward to, such as this lovely piece available for pre-order now.
Mighty Jaxx is now taking pre-orders for the Tiny Tina &amp; Butt Stallion (523 Edition) collectible. This &quot;suuuper beautiful&quot; 8&quot; figurine depicts Tiny Tina decked out in her witchy regalia, riding on the back of the infamous diamond pony herself, Butt Stallion. In true Borderlands fashion, there&#x27;s also plenty of loot that comes along with the purchase of this resin statue.

For the asking price of $199.99, you&#x27;ll also receive a handful of additional items, including an Epic Games Store code to download Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, five character cards, two 4&quot; Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands Mighty Jaxx mini-figures, and 3,000 Mighty coins (a currency used through the loyalty program on the collectible maker&#x27;s website). These bonus items won&#x27;t come in the box with your fanciful statue, however. You&#x27;ll have to verify your Tiny Tina &amp; Butt Stallion figurine via a QR code through the Mighty Jaxx app to receive the game code, order the extra figures, and collect your coins. 
Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands is scheduled for a March 25, 2022 release. While the game key provided with this figuring will only benefit PC users, the game will also be available for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</span>

Revealed today, Hextech Mayhem is described by Riot as a “fast-paced rhythm runner” set in the world of League of Legends, as reported by Eurogamer. It specifically takes place in Piltover, and there’s going to be a lot of bombs in the city, courtesy of Ziggs. 
“From Choice Provisions comes Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story, a fast-paced rhythm runner set in Piltover where every action has an explosive reaction and no amount of mayhem is too much,” the description for the announcement trailer reads. “Play as Ziggs on a quest to build the greatest bomb the world has ever seen while outrunning no-fun-allowed Heimerdinger.”

                    <span>Behaviour Interactive has revealed the next chapter of Dead by Daylight, and it&#x27;s an original story called Portrait of a Murder. 
Set in a surreal interpretation of an abandoned graveyard in the Chilean desert, Portrait of a Murder is &quot;an artistic ode to fear and darkness.&quot; It brings two new Latin American characters to the asymmetrical multiplayer title. One of them is the game&#x27;s first Mexican American character, too.

However, Hidetaka Miyazaki’s Bloodborne often sticks out to me the most. The Victorian architecture, gothic time period, and nightmare-inducing monster design are fascinating but haunting. Even a character as bubbly as Pinocchio couldn’t change Bloodborne’s moody atmosphere, and this couldn’t be any more evident in Lies of P, a soulslike with some serious visual inspirations from Bloodborne that chronicles the journey of a vicious, sword-wielding Pinocchio. 
No, I’m not making this up! Just take a peek at the gameplay teaser below.

                    <span>Developer Q-Games has announced that it has acquired the rights to its 2016 free-to-play multiplayer indie, The Tomorrow Children, and will be bringing it back sometime in the future. 
The Tomorrow Children was released five years ago as a free-to-play game set in a unique world that tasked players with building villages and stocking up on supplies to stop incoming attackers. It features a flair of Soviet Union-influenced post-apocalypse dystopia to it, too. According to Q-Games, a “large number of fans worldwide [clocked] up hundreds of hours each,” but The Tomorrow Children was taken offline just one year after its launch.

And you can see that in the first gameplay trailer for Lies Of P. Some big Bloodborne vibes mixed with a bit of Sekiro, within an edgy murderworld based on the old story. As if anything could be scarier than the bit in the Disney version where the kids get turned into donkeys. But come, watch the trailer.

And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it&#x27;s all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

                    <span>Playground Games will add sign language interpreters to Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s cinematics, adding to an already long list of accessibility features. The devs are currently working American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) support, which will come to the game sometime soon. They&#x27;ved also detailed a number of accessibility options the game has from launch today, including screen reading, game speed modification and more.

                    <span>You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

Any of these Pokémon can be found in their shiny variants as well! The event will also halve the number of steps needed to hatch Pokémon eggs in incubators and lower the Super Incubator steps to one-third of the usual step count required.

What does Dice have in store for Battlefield’s grand return to the modern era? Here’s everything you need to know about this much-anticipated shooter.
What’s changing from previous Battlefield games?
Unlike the last handful of entries in the series, Battlefield 2042 is returning to the franchise&#x27;s roots with an entirely multiplayer experience. DICE has forgone the single-player campaign and is opting to deliver all of its narrative threads through the various multiplayer components, like the maps and in…</span>

                    <span>Update, 11/08/21:
After speculation over a Quality and Performance mode discovered via an Elden Ring purchase listing, FromSoftware has revealed the official specs and compatibility details for the upcoming RPG.
The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions will be identical – both have a Resolution mode that prioritizes a 4K resolution with a 30 FPS lock, and a Performance mode that will prioritize 60 FPS gameplay with a dynamic resolution that adjusts while playing to ensure the 60 FPS frame rate remains stable. Both new-gen consoles will support raytracing (via patch) and HDR as well. 
The Xbox Series S will support resolutions up to 1440p and a 60FPS framerate (via the Performance mode). It also supports HDR, but it won&#x27;t include raytracing. 
On the PlayStation 4 Pro, expect an 1800p re…</span>

                    <span>Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft&#x27;s Netflix-like video game subscription service and its library continues to grow with each passing month. This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn&#x27;t always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. 
Every now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. 
Things are going to get a bit...orange this week
November 8, 2021
This immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation&#x27;s game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it&#x27;s playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it&#x27;s not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today&#x27;s tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. 
But what if it&#x27;s not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it&#x27;s the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it&#x27;s the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. 
Another famous &quot;orange&quot; in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. 
That&#x27;s enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it&#x27;s The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Updated over a long enough timeline, all games seemingly become the same - at least structurally. Deep Rock Galactic got its biggest ever update last week, for example, which adds a battle pass with 100 levels to advance through and new items and cosmetics to unlock. 

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there&#x27;s a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

                    <span>Some players have reported lag in Factorio for years. Lag always seemed fair to me given the sprawling, complex bases you can build in the game, but the latest patch might make things better. Version 1.1.46, released this Saturday, makes several changes which should reduce multiplayer latency.

I&#x27;d have sworn it was 9, tops. The video itself is a 4K remaster of The Old Republic&#x27;s original reveal trailer. If you like the ol&#x27; space biff, this is some really high resolution space biff.

                    <span>Giger-inspired first-person shooter Scorn was due to welcome players to its world of bone and cartilage this year, but not now. A new Kickstarter update says that the game has slipped into 2022, while explaining why the development team have been quiet over the past year.

                    <span>The problem with coming Back 4 Blood is that soon you&#x27;ll want more blood, and more blood. Thankfully, Left 4 Dead creators Turtle Rock have detailed more of the post-launch plans for their new zombie-smashing shooter, laying out the content roadmap for the next few months and into next year. Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

                    <span>The League Of Legends spin-off animated series Arcane started on Neflix this weekend, giving fans a glimpse at Jinx and Vi&#x27;s rather dark beginnings. Over the last week or so, the developers have been celebrating the arrival of the show in other games too, with Jinx-themed Valorant skins and even a crossover with Fortnite. The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new &quot;interactive experiences&quot;, game modes and more.

                    <span>Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

                    <span>If you feel like you might at any point want a copy of Metal Gear Solid 2 on PC, you should probably buy it today. Konami have announced that starting today, they plan to temporarily remove MGS2 (and 3, though that&#x27;s not on PC) from digital stores while they renew licenses for historical footage used in the game. They plan to start selling them again once the licenses are renewed, but that would require Konami successfully accomplishing something, and do you really trust them to do that?

                    <span>Comedian Dara Ó Briain has an old bit where he talks about video games, and the difficulty barrier that games have compared to other kinds of media. &quot;You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game.&quot;
Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;m not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the &quot;difficulty in games&quot; debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can&#x27;t answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

                    <span>With less than three weeks to go before the launch of Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, Square Enix announced a two-week delay for the MMORPG&#x27;s fourth expansion. Previously due on the 23rd of November, it&#x27;s now expected on the 7th of December. Sounds like they need more time to work on stability, though game director Naoki Yoshida&#x27;s explanation was a little more dramatic, offering his &quot;sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused to our players and colleagues due to my own shortomings.&quot;

But after 16 years at the company, the studio director wanted to try something new, and is currently working on a free educational game named PowerZ. I spoke to Capron about what this new project will entail, and how it felt to leave Arkane after such a long career there.

In 2020, BioWare revealed they were working on a brand new game in the series, but this year they looked back on the Mass Effect trilogy remasters that came out in May. I thought that was all they had in store until the very end of the day when they tweeted a new teaser poster for the next game, featuring a crater shaped like a giant geth head. Geth! Mass Effect trilogy villains! Get your goggles on, reader, it&#x27;s time to investigate this pic.

                    <span>Operační systém Raspberry Pi OS pro jednodeskové počítače Raspberry Pi byl dnes aktualizován na Debian 11 Bullseye. Také všechny desktopové aplikace přešly na knihovnu GTK+3 a manažer oken byl změněn z openbox na mutter. Nevýhodou mutter je, že musí vykreslit celou obrazovku do paměti a tím vzrostla paměťová náročnost. Proto se mutter použije jen na modelech s 2 GB RAM a více. Na ostatních bude stále openbox.</span>

                    <span>At the end of a week in which publishers Square Enix publicly expressed disappointment with how Marvel&#x27;s Avengers went down, the game has some good news: one of the most popular Marvelmen will swing in later this month, Spider-Man. Oh. But he&#x27;s exclusive to the PlayStation version. Oh no. That&#x27;s not feel-good news to lift spirits at all.

                    <span>E4 have dropped the first trailer for their GamesMaster reboot, showing a quick blast showing of competitive gaming, and an orby hologram of a man. GamesMaster was an old TV show in the 90s hosted by Dominik Diamond where they&#x27;d review games, give out tips, and get celebrities to compete in gaming challenges. The reboot seems to have more of that good stuff, and this time around will be hosted by Robert Florence.

                    <span>Planet Zoo is celebrating its two-year anniversary with a free update that adds black and white ruffed lemurs, and a new cake shop. I&#x27;m very excited, lemurs are my favourites! I went to the IRL zoo last month and the lemur walkthrough was closed, which was absolutely gutting. But if I can&#x27;t have real lemurs, you can be damn sure I&#x27;m adding some of these fluffy fellas to my virtual enclosures.

                    <span>Yes, it&#x27;s a shotgun list. No, we won&#x27;t be doing rocks or paper next. You can put that line back in your little joke sack. If I see any of you besmirching my thoroughly researched and vigourously typed article with such a low-hanging jest, I will take one of the following mortality transmission devices, be it the double barrelled murderspout of Doom 2 or the loud-mouthed body vaporisor of F.E.A.R, and I will demonstrate their crimson purpose. 
Sit down. Here are the best shotguns in video games.

                    <span>Fittingly for Fireworks Night, Call Of Duty: Vanguard launched in the wee hours, bringing a great many big explosions as the first-person shooter series returns to World War 2 once again. Along with yer usual story campaign and multiplayer modes, it has Treyarch&#x27;s Zombies too. Though I do suspect the part of Vanguard many want isn&#x27;t out yet, and they won&#x27;t even pay for: the new Pacific island map coming to CoD: Warzone at a later point.

                    <span>Previous generations worried that humanity would be hurried towards its demise by nuclear war. My fear is that our destruction will be brought about by FIFA players opening Ultimate Team packs to &quot;earn&quot; NFTs. 

Yes, EA CEO Andrew Wilson followed in Ubisoft&#x27;s footsteps by saying that he thought NFTs and play-to-earn would be &quot;an important part of the future of our industry.&quot;

The Sims 4&#x27;s Blooming Rooms kit feels designed for me. It&#x27;s one of Maxis&#x27;s new micro-DLCs, and it lets you pack rooms with flora without the need to keep the alive through knowledge or effort.

                    <span>Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

Amazon say they&#x27;ve banned many players who were spamming chat advertising their illicit services. They also blasted a blog post talking about many of the issues concerning players, explaining things, detailing plans for fixes, and other welcome news.

Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

                    <span>From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn&#x27;t it?

Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

                    <span>Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio&#x27;s gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we&#x27;re leaving the Ancestor&#x27;s squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they&#x27;re excited to be working in early access again.

Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we&#x27;ve had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon&#x27;s own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.

                    <span>After taking a deep breath, Sega have shouted a large amount of news about Total War: Warhammer 3&#x27;s launch. For starters, the release date is February 17th, 2022. For main course, folks who buy it within a week of launch will get the Ogre Kingdoms DLC for free. And for dessert, it will be in Xbox Game Pass For PC. A fair meal, there. But here, come meet the Ogres in this new trailer below.

                    <span>Grief is a delicate subject to tackle, and games sometimes stumble in their approaches, either making things excessively mournful or veering into cringe territory with you know, like, emotions, man. But Arte&#x27;s upcoming puzzling game, How To Say Goodbye, looks like a refreshingly playful take on loss. Not to mention that it’s a feast for the eyes. I mean, just LOOK at it.

                    <span>Dice have detailed some of the options players will get to mess around with in Battlefield 2042&#x27;s map customisation tool, Battlefield Portal, and there&#x27;s just so much. It will present you with some of your fave maps from the likes of Bad Company 2 and the Battlefields of old, then let you tweak them as much as you please by adding various vehicles, rules and more. I&#x27;m personally hoping to see plenty of oldies with 2042&#x27;s sweet new grappling hook thrown in. Every map could be improved by a grappling hook.

                    <span>By now you’ve probably heard about how Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs shake up the previously stagnant Core line. Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.

                    <span>The Intel Core i5-12600K is, in some ways, the CPU that Intel should have made three or four years ago. Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. 


This was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.

According to a number of reports, that project was a third-person action game from Mafia 3 developers Hangar 13 that would&#x27;ve featured superheroes and online play.

                    <span>XCOM studio Firaxis have announced a delay for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, their turn-based tactics game in the BAM! BIF! POW! world of Marvel superheroes. Previously due in March 2022, it&#x27;s now pushed back into the second half of 2022. I say &quot;previously&quot;; the game was only announced two months ago. Sounds like someone had a serious rethink about the state of the project. But if it needs the time, it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s getting the time.

                    <span>Inscryption is good, very good. I mean, we&#x27;ve slapped a Bestest Best badge on it, like one of its in-game sigils. What effect does it have? Play the game and you&#x27;ll quickly realise it does things games aren&#x27;t supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I&#x27;m actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn&#x27;t realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.

But I certainly don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spoken about the subject with anyone who does. So, seeing as Psychonauts 2 has now released a patch with new features to help players collect every little doodad and tick off achievements, I want to ask: do you do this? Will you? Please tell me about it!

                    <span>You&#x27;d think being 1000 years old would earn you some respect, but in Demon Turf, that means you&#x27;re still a child. Admittedly, it makes for an intriguing premise in this tale of conquest and demonic shakedowns, but don&#x27;t be fooled. While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic&#x27;s Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.

Allen Brack left the company in August, Oneal had been in charge of the studio with Mike Ybarra, who&#x27;ll now take the lead on his own. Oneal claims she&#x27;s not leaving because she&#x27;s &quot;without hope for Blizzard&quot;, but wants to &quot;do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well.&quot;
