                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live action One Piece series will set sail this year. 
The subscription streaming service revealed this news today with a new image and a poster for the upcoming pirate series based on the long-running (and extremely popular) manga and anime series, One Piece. The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix&#x27;s One Piece logo in the image below as well:

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar&#x27;s Sanji, Emily Rudd&#x27;s Nami, Godoy&#x27;s Luffy, Jacob Gibson&#x27;s Usopp, and Mackenyu&#x27;s Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew&#x27;s ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven&#x27;t seen Netflix&#x27;s One Piece show in motion so here&#x27;s hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 
While waiting for more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

                              <span>The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching&#x27;s family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU &amp; Naughty Dog family! 💔

Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv&#x27;s depiction of her character in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

                              <span>Sony has released a new PlayStation add called &quot;Live From PS5&quot; that showcases a few of the console&#x27;s biggest titles, both past and upcoming, in a fictional news segment, and among the clips are two shots that we don&#x27;t recognize. And they remind us a lot of Uncharted. 
This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

                              <span>Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario&#x27;s famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday&#x27;s big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we&#x27;ve seen before, before Mario hits a yellow &quot;?&quot; block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it&#x27;s useful in the game, that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case here as Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario&#x27;s reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen&#x27;s character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can&#x27;t wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7.

When SpongeBob SquarePants debuted in 1999, I had just said goodbye to Nicktoons and Nickelodeon as a whole. Arguably, I should have parted with that part of my childhood a few years earlier, but I was a late bloomer. Nevertheless, the misadventures of the little yellow sponge that lived in a pineapple under the sea would fly under my radar for several years. It wasn&#x27;t until my final year of high school that I, bored at home one afternoon, decided to give the show a go during one of its many marathons.
I remember the first episode I saw. It was &quot;Graveyard Shift,&quot; the episode where SpongeBob and Squidward have to work 24-hour shifts at the Krusty Krab. If you&#x27;ve seen it, you know the episode goes for kid-friendly horror and ends with an out-of-left-field cameo f…</span>

The entertainment world is in mourning after hearing the sad news that Annie Wersching, who portrayed the much-loved character of Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s The Last of Us, passed away on Sunday, January 29. She was 45.
Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977 and pursued the dramatic arts at an early age, training as an Irish stepdancer throughout her schooling before transitioning to the world of the theater during her college years, eventually earning a BFA in Musical Theater in 1999. Wersching&#x27;s on-screen debut came about in 2002, with an appearance in Star Trek: Enterprise, which would lead to a steady stream of television work, including bit roles in shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Birds of Prey, Frasier, Killer Instinct, Boston Legal, Castle, Runaways,…</span>

                              <span>No sign of the DK Rap, unfortunately
This weekend saw the production company Illumination release a short teaser for its fun-looking Super Mario Bros. Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming&#x27;s most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan&#x27;s performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.
The clip rolls out with footage we&#x27;ve seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin&#x27; ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario&#x27;s solemn &quot;Meow&quot; fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.

I&#x27;d love to think that the &quot;Meow&quot; line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it&#x27;s probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan&#x27;s snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. And, you know what? it&#x27;s really not looking too bad.

                              <span>I love secret languages in games. I’m too slow to decipher any of them myself, but I enjoy seeing a game’s community pick apart foreign symbols to uncover a game’s deep mysteries (Tunic’s musical language was especially fun.) Fortunately for me, players have already deciphered the ‘Indecipherable’ text log in the new Dead Space remake, revealing a poem that potentially hints toward the series’ future. Naturally, spoilers within.

                              <span>Footage purporting to be from Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s multiplayer alpha has appeared online. The leak surfaced on Reddit over the weekend, claiming to be from a &quot;very old alpha&quot; build from summer 2020. It&#x27;s an interesting watch, as while the world and robo dinos look like classic Horizon, the characters jumping around fighting them look a lot more stylised than their hyper-detailed mainline counterparts.

                              <span>I spent the past weekend flicking between the Dead Space remake on my PC, and the Dead Space remake on my Steam Deck. It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

                              <span>Keyboards are eternally horizontal, and moving or rotating them outside of their designated comfort zone feels like an affront to all that is good and right with the world. But that&#x27;s precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it&#x27;s a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe&#x27;s back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you&#x27;re once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.

                              <span>Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there&#x27;s no word on who&#x27;s attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to &quot;build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film.&quot; This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics&#x27; game is already in production, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

A few years ago, Purple Lamp Studios released SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, a solid revival of a 3D platforming classic from decades past. Sales for that remaster were evidently robust enough to justify development of an all-new sequel, as SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was announced a little over a year later. Built from the ground up for modern hardware, this new release carries on the spirit of the original while integrating many new ideas and designs of its own. Though The Cosmic Shake isn’t exactly a game that reinvents the 3D platforming wheel, it offers an enjoyable and delightful experience that no fan of this nostalgic genre will want to miss.
The Cosmic Shake picks up with SpongeBob and Patrick meeting a mysterious mermaid named Kassandra who offers them a bottle of mermaid tears for them to use as bubble soap. The tears have magical properties and legend has it that they have the ability to grant wishes, but things get out of hand when SpongeBob and Patrick overuse them and tear apart the multiverse. As a result of their mistake, Bikini Bottom has become drenched in cosmic jelly and overrun by strange jelly creatures, while all of SpongeBob and Patrick’s friends have been scattered across the various Wishworlds that opened portals all around town. The two thus set out to repair the damage and collect jelly for Kassandra, who totally doesn’t have ulterior motives.

                              <span>Driven by Monster Hunter and Resident Evil.
Capcom has today released its latest financial report for the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2023. In it, the publisher states that it expects to reach a record 40 million in unit sales by the end of the period, driven in large part by the Monster Hunter and Resident Evil franchises.
The forecast comes after the publisher confirmed it has sold an incredible 29.1 million units during the fiscal year so far, up from 25.8 million the year prior. This is primarily due to the growth of catalog titles, including the remarkably successful launch of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which recently surpassed 5 million units sold.

                              <span>Putting the &quot;fun&quot; in d(f)ungeon.
I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Pokémon Mystery Dungeon recently. Maybe it&#x27;s the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question &quot;What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?&quot; my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.
Either way, that&#x27;s the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn&#x27;t very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.

Ever since its announcement in September&#x27;s Direct Showcase, we have been getting a steady stream of Theatrhythm Final Bar Line information from Square Enix — but we are always hungry for more! Fortunately, it looks like just that will be happening soon, as a Final Bar Line livestream has been announced for today at 9:00pm GMT / 1:00pm PST!
The news was shared via the @FinalFantasy Twitter account and the stream is set to take place on the official Square Enix Twitch channel a little later on. What exactly the livestream will entail is still something of a mystery, though we do know that it will feature content from developers at indieszero as well as words from one of the producers, Ichiro Hazama.

Nintendo&#x27;s next major title, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, is looming in the distance, due for release on the Switch on February 24th, 2023.
We&#x27;ve already been treated to a glimpse at the new copy abilities that will be featured in the game, but if an image posted over on reddit is to be believed, it appears that Kirby&#x27;s revamped classic will be adding a lot more content than we could have possibly hoped for.

If you were around in the late 1990s and happily poured many hours into GoldenEye 007, then you have probably come across the &#x27;Four Bonds&#x27; hoax. This was a theory which stated that it was possible to unlock the face textures for previous Bond actors Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton in the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode after completing a series of near-impossible tasks.
This was, of course, not true (regardless of what Nintendo-working uncles might tell you); although the face textures of these past Bonds did exist in the game&#x27;s ROM in some rudimentary form after initial plans to add the actors were scrapped thanks to some pesky legal worries. While the other Bond models were removed completely, the face textures were instead moved to the &#x27;unused pile&#x27; rather than risk deleting anything else from the game&#x27;s build so close to release.

                              <span>It had no right!
There is a lot of video game music out there that goes hard. By &quot;goes hard&quot; we mean it slaps. By &quot;it slaps&quot; we mean it&#x27;s a bop. By &quot;it&#x27;s a bop&quot; we mea— forget it. These are tracks that are really good.
In the vast majority of these instances, the tracks match the situation pretty perfectly. A high-stakes moment in the game might be met by tense strings and an ever-rising pitch; action set-pieces might opt for a big brass statement of the main theme to emphasise your heroic movements; chilled-out hubs might provide some lighter tracks on the keys, bringing your pulse down if it&#x27;s generally an intense game or letting you fully relax into the world à la Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

Sports Story wasn&#x27;t in the best state at launch, but fortunately, a few updates have been released since then. We&#x27;re now up to Version 1.0.4 and while it includes the usual fixes and improvements, it&#x27;s also got one other interesting change in it.
Access to the &quot;secret dev room&#x27; has now been blocked. If you haven&#x27;t already seen it, it&#x27;s a section of the game where you go into a hidden area and can talk to the &quot;developers of the video game&quot; about the development environment. Here are the full patch notes for Sports Story Version 1.0.4:

                              <span>Got GoldenEye, bagged Banjo, dare we dream of more?
Looking at the library of N64 games currently available if you&#x27;re a Nintendo Switch Onlne subscriber at the Expansion Pack tier, we now have access to not one, but two of Rareware&#x27;s all-time 64-bit classics in the form of Banjo-Kazooie and, now, GoldenEye 007. Just a handful of years ago this might have seemed like a pipedream, but with Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s appearance in Smash Bros. Ultimate apparently helping to establish a &#x27;relationship&#x27; between Nintendo and Microsoft — the owners of Rare for over 20 years now — having the Twycross developer&#x27;s work appearing once again on a Nintendo platform isn&#x27;t such a strange idea anymore.
There&#x27;s still a suite of games from the developer&#x27;s golden years that could potentially come to Nintendo Switch Online. Most are available on Xbox as part of the sublime Rare Replay package, and some of them, specifically those featuring Nintendo IP, are perhaps more likely to make an appearance on Switch than others.

One game we&#x27;re hoping to see show up on the Switch at some point this year is Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp. The last update for this title was featured in a Nintendo financial report last November - revealing the game&#x27;s release date was still &quot;TBA&quot;.
Now, in the latest development, a thread on Famiboards has apparently highlighted changes to the game&#x27;s eShop web page - with &quot;new NSUID attached&quot;. As explained in the same post, a new NSUID means &quot;pre-orders will be going live at some point in the future&quot;.

For last week&#x27;s brawl, we took a look at one of a handful of Virtual Boy games (and one that many of you had forgotten even existed): Panic Bomber. It wasn&#x27;t a particularly close race for this one, with Japan winning comfortably with 71% of the vote. Well done, Japan!

So here&#x27;s what players are saying so far. First up, some of the more glowing impressions:

                              <span>Overwatch 2 players haven&#x27;t been happy with the way its ranked matches have worked since launch. Blizzard agree, it seems, although they&#x27;re not going to be reverting back to how things were in Overwatch 1. Instead they&#x27;ll be implementing changes in season 3 and season 4 &quot;aimed at creating more clarity in the system.&quot;

The retro-inspired shooter genre is really in high gear. Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.
Dread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.

                              <span>Cutesy platforming legend returns on PS4 and Nintendo Switch
A real Taito gem has been added to the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster has re-released the veteran arcade developers&#x27; ultra-cute, ultra-challenging platform actioner The NewZealand Story, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the arcade market in 1988, before swiftly being ported to a wide variety of home computer and console platforms. The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized &quot;NewZealand&quot;, determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.
You can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kdyRIX4q0MY&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Shadowserg
What follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It&#x27;s a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.
The NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito&#x27;s &#x27;80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming&#x27;s most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.
The NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is one of those games that I kept hearing about, but it took me a minute to get around to playing it with all the amazing titles that came out last year. I know I’m a bit late to the party on this one, as the game originally came out back in August of 2022, but I’m so glad that I went back to give this one a shot. 
I went into this playthrough without knowing anything about the game and without any real expectations, and exactly one completed playthrough later, I’m absolutely in love with this title. I can’t think of any other game like it, and I can’t think of a game I’ve ever played that’s made me want to dive immediately into another playthrough right away as much as this one did.

In a series featuring over 89 playable fighters, there’s no shortage of options for the player to choose from. While the franchise has always been known for stuffing each subsequent title full of characters, usually each with their respective balancing concerns, there are still a decent number of standout figures that most people in the Smash community can probably agree warrant inclusion on any list of must-picks.

                              <span>Another day, another rerelease
The past few years have been rife with some awesome remakes or remasters of some of the best classic games out there, including but not limited to titles like Bioshock, Final Fantasy VII, Dead Space, The Last of Us Part I, and the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. While this trend is only heating up with seemingly more and more remakes/remasters released and announced every year, I&#x27;m starting to think about what other classic games I&#x27;d like to see get a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.
This is a bit of a tricky one for me because I didn&#x27;t game as much when I was younger — unless Disney Interactive Studios is willing to revive the 2007 PS2 banger that was High School Musical: Sing It! That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t some classic games that are nostalgic for me,…</span>

Whether you’re going from the dead cold of winter to the crisp dew of spring or leaving behind the dog days of summer for the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, the dawn of a coming season can bring with it fresh perspective and rejuvenation. At least, that’s what the changing of seasons is in our world. In SEASON: A letter to the future, seasons don’t necessarily abide by the calendar. People can’t assume they know when a season is going to end, but when it does, far more than just the temperature will change.

Good morning, good weekend, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? It has been a month of a week, and literally a month of the year, and, frankly, I&#x27;m quite ready to hit the big reset button and give 2023 another go. I sort of stumbled out of the starting blocks, as did much of the wider world, and here&#x27;s to hoping the remainder of the year goes a little more smoothly. I hope that the year has started well for all of you, regardless.
And, as we enter the final weekend of January, I&#x27;m very happy to see you show out for our weekly get-together. It might not be a live stream, we might not all be in a chat window smashing dat lyke button, but we&#x27;re here in our own time, at our own pace, and surrounded by our fellow vidya game fans.

One of the reasons Steam has continued to be one of the most successful gaming platforms is because the team at Valve is so dedicated to creating the best user interface they can. I&#x27;m still in the camp that would rather see them making more games than shuttering development to simply focus on Steam (although they insist otherwise), but at least they&#x27;re constantly making changes to the store that make the game-buying experience more enjoyable. They also make their experimentation process somewhat transparent with Steam Labs, where they &quot;create dozens of experiments around discoverability, video, machine learning, and more.&quot;
The newest experiment on the website is called DLC For You, which is a page that compiles information about the DLC…</span>

                              <span>But not unplayable by any means
The 1997 FPS GoldenEye 007 is considered one of the best influential shooters of all time, especially when it comes to its local co-op mode (I guess technically it had to be local because online play hadn&#x27;t been invented yet). I missed out on the golden age of the James Bond title because I wasn&#x27;t even a year old when it came out, but hearing friends and colleagues recounting the magical months and years that followed its release, I&#x27;m somewhat envious of a time before online gamer rage. Now&#x27;s my chance to live vicariously, though, because Rare announced that GoldenEye 007 is available to play on Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles 26 years after it launched on the Nintendo 64.

A new retelling of Lara Croft&#x27;s tale could be on the way from an interesting angle. According to a new report, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been picked up to work on a Tomb Raider TV series for Amazon.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Waller-Bridge is reportedly attached to write the scripts for the Tomb Raider project. She&#x27;d also be on as executive producer, alongside Ryan Andolina and Amanda Greenblatt. She is not, according to THR&#x27;s report, currently signed on to star in the adaptation.
Waller-Bridge recently renewed a deal with Amazon, which also brought her onto the adaptation of the novel Sign Here by Claudia Lux. She&#x27;s garnered acclaim for her work on the TV series Fleabag, is set to star in the upcoming Indiana Jones film, an…</span>

You know you&#x27;ve got it made when your game is so successful that you get a spin-off — and plenty of the biggest games in the biz have done exactly that, from Musou crossovers and sports-playing alternate universes to rhythm and strategy games. And you know what? They&#x27;re usually pretty dang good.
We&#x27;ve compiled a list of the best of the best — the 8/10s and higher in the spin-off space, which are good for newcomers to the series and old hands alike.

It&#x27;s hard to believe it, but Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a year old today. This Pokémon game took us back to the distant past and completely shook up the formula of what we all expected from a mainline Pokémon entry. And, quite frankly, we want more of what it gave us.
Legends: Arceus sees you get thrown back in time thanks to resident Pokémon god, Arceus, to the Hisui region — which would later become known as the Sinnoh region. The game shoves aside many traditional Pokémon mechanics and introduced various new features, but the hunt to fulfill Arceus&#x27; wishes of &quot;seeing all Pokémon&quot; (this god has the power to give you a phone in the Pokéworld, apparently) is the ultimate goal. This is no longer just about catching and battling — you&#x27;re a full-fledged Pokémon researcher.

                              <span>Drain the core.
Drainus. Whether a ham-fisted portmanteau of Darius and Gradius, or relating to the game’s core mechanic, it’s a silly name any way you look at it. Japan-based developer Team Ladybug, more recently known for the rather good Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, has had the Switch shooting game hardcore waiting eight months since the game’s Steam release, but does it live up to the hype?
Drainus pays homage to many genre classics; a touch of Border Down in its ship functions and styling, a nod to Einhander in the aesthetic of its stage-two train assault, and plenty of Gradius V in its transforming boss phases. The one influence that’s been touted heavily in previews, inexplicably, is Ikaruga, as if it’s the only other title in the genre the mainstream gaming press has ever heard of. While Drainus features a system of absorbing enemy fire that can be returned in a flurry of homing lasers, the execution here has far more in common with Takumi’s Giga Wing than it does Treasure’s puzzle-shmup hybrid, making it a largely erroneous comparison.

Well here we are folks. It&#x27;s the final week of January and we have had our first big Nintendo release of the year. Consider 2023 to be well and truly underway!
This week at Nintendo Life, we got all kinds of excited for the eventual release of GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo Switch Online N64 library and suggested a quick fix for those pesky controls. We also looked ahead to the year, running through the 9 questions we still have about Tears of the Kingdom and breaking down everything coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley in 2023.

It seems Square Enix is once again calling on fans to have their say about what games they would like to see next. In a recent Japanese survey, the company known for the Final Fantasy series asked local residents of Japan what games and genres they would like to see from Team Asano in the future.
Team Asano, in case you need a refresher, most recently worked on the Switch exclusive Bravely Default II and also the HD-2D project Triangle Strategy. In the same survey, Square Enix asked fans about future remakes and remasters. These were the two questions featured:

We&#x27;ve heard requests for a Switch and Xbox side-by-side comparison of GoldenEye 007, so here it is. It&#x27;s all thanks to our sister site Pure Xbox, and the amazing efforts of video producer Craig Reid (along with a little help from our own video team).
On paper, there are some differences between the two versions in terms of features. Firstly, the Switch version has the ability to take multiplayer sessions online. On the Xbox front, the controls are set up for dual-analog gaming, it&#x27;s got achievements and it displays in native 16:9 widescreen at up to 4K Ultra HD.

It offers up a tailored list of additional content you might be interested in for games you already own, and prioritises those you&#x27;ve played recently or played most.

                              <span>Dead Space returns today with just a few tweaks from devs Motive Studio, and among these are a bevy of accessibility options. One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.

Anyway, if working in retail was like running the shop in Kardboard Kings, then everyone would love it.

                              <span>You know what’s guaranteed to make me laugh every single time? A good visual gag in a cartoon. A little freak reading a newspaper, for instance. A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that&#x27;s jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

                              <span>Ubisoft are working on two new Far Cry games, according to a new report, including the next mainline entry, Far Cry 7, and a standalone multiplayer offshoot from the series. Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

                              <span>It turns out Forspoken has bigger problems than some badly-landing bantz. The PC version absolutely brutalises low-end hardware, an issue compounded by its high yet often unhelpful system requirements, and framerate drops and stuttering remain common even on some of the best graphics cards around. Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

                              <span>We kick off 2023&#x27;s inaugural episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, by doing some - rare - forward thinking. That&#x27;s right, Hayden gets genuinely excited over a couple of his most anticipated FPS games of the year, and I realise that I&#x27;m less &quot;excited&quot; and more &quot;intrigued&quot; by what&#x27;s on offer. The consensus? We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we&#x27;ve started two new things! We&#x27;re breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

I want to say &quot;a year ago&quot;, but that could turn out to be any time in the last three years if I actually check. It didn&#x27;t quite push me over the &quot;Article Threshold&quot; back then, but having given it a proper go now it&#x27;s out of early access, it&#x27;s time.
You&#x27;re a little spaceship, with a simple but intriguing backstory, who&#x27;s appeared near an inhabited planet. A transmission asks you to repair their defensive shield before &quot;the Deadeye&quot; arrives to genocide them, which, uh, okay I think I know whose side I&#x27;m on here, game.

So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable. If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here&#x27;s how to get the original working well on PC.

Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Above the Berlin Samurai Museum&#x27;s gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I&#x27;ve come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I&#x27;ve played of the game&#x27;s earliest portions, it&#x27;s Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don&#x27;t expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you&#x27;re a fan or a newcomer, it&#x27;s looking like it&#x27;ll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.

Craig Mazin discussed his hopes for the TV version of The Last Of Us while guesting on an upcoming episode of The Playlist Podcast. Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

                              <span>Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he&#x27;s recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac&#x27;s many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

                              <span>Co-founders of the studio developing Steam wishlist hit The Day Before have rejected claims the game is a scam. The post-apocalyptic survival MMO was delayed from March to November this week as it turned out the devs hadn&#x27;t actually got the game trademarked, prompting accusations from within the game’s Discord and Reddit communities that it might not exist at all. Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

Mozart and Mario might sound really similar in name, but they don&#x27;t have too many other similarities — except for that one time that Mozart was in a little-known SNES/NES game called Mario&#x27;s Time Machine, but let&#x27;s not worry about that for now.
Our point is that you have to be pretty darn creative to mash the two up into an opera, but that&#x27;s just what the LA-based Pacific Opera Project has done with their retelling of Mozart&#x27;s opera, The Magic Flute — or as they&#x27;re calling it, #Superflute.

                              <span>It really makes you wonder.
Wonder Boy Anniversary Collection gets a lot right. It features six great titles in the series, with complete region variations and all their alternate console ports, from arcade to SG-1000, to Master System, Mega Drive, and Game Gear — 21 titles in total. It has a bevy of in-game options for finely tweaking the image with CRT filters, screen curvatures, mask ratios, and just about everything else one might desire to recreate the look of an ancient, nigh-on blown-out TV screen. You can also utilise rewind features and access save states and in-game maps if you feel no guilt about cheating your way through many of the game’s labyrinths.
The package includes Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, Monster World II: The Dragon’s Trap, Monster World III, and Monster World IV, the latter two being salient Mega Drive entries among a series of generally excellent games. Presentation is simplistic, but fine, with wallpaper for 4:3 aspect ratios and some nice music accompanying the menus. There’s even an enormous gallery section absolutely stuffed with everything from concept art to arcade flyers, accompanying soundtrack options, and more.

My partner is the most patient man I&#x27;ve ever met. It&#x27;s one of the things I appreciate about him the most — especially since I&#x27;m the opposite. He&#x27;s the Lawful Good to my Chaotic Neutral. I&#x27;m a cyclone and he&#x27;s calm waters. Opposites attract, right?
For most of our relationship, this dynamic — his patience, combined with my spontaneity — has made us a pretty great team, able to support each other in exactly the ways that we ourselves are lacking.

                              <span>An ancient piracy battle has reached its final verdict at the Dutch Supreme Court. After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

I don’t really watch video game shows or streamers. If you want the snarky response, I’d say that I prefer to play games rather than watch them, but that’s not really true. I don’t watch much of anything, regardless of it&#x27;s TV or movies. I’m too busy playing video games.
There’s one exception to this, and that’s GameCenter CX, a Japanese video game show that started in 2003 and still runs today. Something of a precursor to the various skits and shows today, it involves a comedian named Shinya Arino as he tackles a wide variety of retro games. The joy comes from the dramatic focus on his struggles. He has his successes, but even after two decades of hosting the show, he’s really not that great.
I love it because it’s a great way to discover games from Japan. Beyond that is the us…</span>

                              <span>Two new Far Cry projects may be in the cards
It looks like Ubisoft is planning for a hefty amount of Far Cry in the future. New reports indicate Ubisoft is working on the next Far Cry, as well as a standalone multiplayer Far Cry spin-off.
Reports first surfaced at Insider Gaming, saying two Far Cry projects are in the works. One is &quot;presumed to be&quot; a single-player experience, while the other would be a multiplayer title. Insider Gaming&#x27;s report claims these titles were originally one project, and were then split into two separate games early in development.
Kotaku corroborates parts of the report. It&#x27;s also heard that both projects were mentioned in a recent internal Ubisoft update from CEO Yves Guillemot. According to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, this next Far Cry entry will see the series move from the Dunia engine to Snowdrop, the engine powering The Division 2.
According to Kotaku&#x27;s sources, Ubisoft has been trying to make a fully multiplayer Far Cry for years. Attempts were then canceled or morphed into other projects. This would be the first time in the series&#x27; history that it has completely standalone multiplayer, though, rather than a mode packaged into the mainline Far Cry entry. When contacted for comment by Kotaku about the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson said the company doesn&#x27;t comment on rumors and speculation.

A Far Cry from its predecessors
Though a new Far Cry makes complete sense, the multiplayer portion of these reports is interesting. Ubisoft has at least one big live-service game in Rainbow Six: Siege, but Far Cry has usually had multiplayer as a feature, rather than the full focus.
The company has seen some rough waters recently though, between recent comments from its CEO and cancelling a good number of games and pushing pirate sim Skull and Bones back again.

Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet have brought its third 7-Star Tera Raid battle into the game, and with it comes a change of pace. The previous Charizard and Cinderace raids favored Pokemon who could tank Fire-Type hits like a champ, but many of these monsters won’t necessarily excel against Greninja. There is one returning champion, but we’ll get to that later.
As has been tradition with the 7-Star Raids so far, you can only catch one Greninja while the event is live. That said, you can freely grind this raid for higher drop rates of rare items like Ability Patches and Bottle Caps. More importantly, since Greninja will always sport the same moves and Poison Tera-Type, you can repeat a winning strategy as often as your teammates are willing to cooperate. Here’s…</span>

Hi-Fi Rush has a lot going for it. The latest title from The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks is an action-rhythm game that blends the two genres expertly. It was practically made in a lab for me, as someone who&#x27;s very enthusiastic about both rhythm games and Tango Gameworks&#x27; transition into action game design. I love its plucky hero, Chai, and his companions (I have a special fondness for 808, the robot cat that turns into the flying ball thing from Mobile Suit Gundam). I&#x27;m a huge fan of the game&#x27;s flashy comic book art and its early-00s soundtrack.
But you know what I love more than Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s electrifying gameplay? Its humble release. Just hours after the game was announced, it quietly dropped on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. I have long held that certain gam…</span>

                              <span>We all saw this one coming
HBO&#x27;s adaptation of The Last of Us has been one of the biggest hits for the platform in about a decade, garnering a staggering 10 million viewers within the first two days of the premiere alone, as well as gaining the most viewers from a first to second episode of any show ever on HBO. It pretty much felt like the show was going to get a renewal as soon as we saw the success of the premiere episode, so the writing was on the wall with this one. We haven&#x27;t gotten any other official info from the announcement so far — we just know Season 2 will be on the way.
https://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1619017515581018112
As far as the content of Season 2, we know as per the show&#x27;s creators that it will be covering the events of The Last of Us Part II, as this first season will come to a close along with the first game&#x27;s story. One thing to consider is that the sequel is considerably longer than its predecessor — over double the length in terms of hours — so there&#x27;s a chance that they&#x27;ll need more than one season to tackle its narrative. In an interview from The Hollywood Reporter, Neil Druckmann revealed that they don&#x27;t have any plans for the show&#x27;s story to go beyond the games.
Personally, I think my viewing experience of The Last of Us will have to end with Season 1. My curiosity is enough to carry me through as of now, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have it in me to sit through a whole other season — especially because the story of Part II wasn&#x27;t my favorite to begin with. As a fan, I&#x27;m happy to see the franchise thriving, but I&#x27;ve spent so much time thinking and talking about it, I think it&#x27;s time to move on for a while after I finish covering Season 1.

Devolver Digital has announced that its vengeance-fueled samurai slasher Trek to Yomi will be released on Nintendo Switch Monday, January 30, following on from its previous appearance on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in the summer of 2022.
Developed by Flying Wild Hog, Trek to Yomi is a love letter to the bloodthirsty-but-stoic samurai epics of yore, and tells the tale of a young swordsman who sets out on a pilgrimage to the titular town, with the aim of confronting the ancient master who razed his village to the ground. Featuring intensely violent side-scrolling action, Trek to Yomi attempts to capture the balletic carnage and aesthetic violence of the many movies that poured out of Toei Studios between the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Kexl_PrUeFo&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;DevolverDigital
Unfortunately on launch, Trek to Yomi didn&#x27;t quite receive the smash hit reviews one might have hoped, but it was universally praised for its presentation style, great soundtrack, and fine, if unremarkable gameplay. For fans of the samurai genre, Trek to Yomi is still more than worth picking up, and remains a fine example of a modern-day, Edo-era release — alongside fantastic titles such as FromSoftware&#x27;s  Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Sucker Punch&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima.
Trek to Yomi launches January 30 on Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PLayStation, PC, and Xbox.

While From Software typically dominates the modern action-adventure conversation (especially after the more considerable success of Elden Ring), many other games are vying for attention. As most of my colleagues know, I constantly sing the praises of recent works from Team Ninja: including both Nioh games.
While there&#x27;s still a lot more of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty for me to see, I&#x27;m two demos in; and I&#x27;m just ready for the thing to come out already.

Skybound Entertainment has made a committed financial investment in indie studio MegaCat Studios, the developer working on fun-looking, ring-rocking RPG WrestleQuest.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Skybound Entertainment has not released a figure for its investment, but the site&#x27;s sources believe it to be in the &quot;multi-million&quot; region. As a publisher Skybound currently holds IPs such as The Walking Dead and Escape Academy, while also owning physical distribution rights for titles such as Cuphead, Psychonauts 2, Untitled Goose Game, Gang Beasts, and more recently Striking Distance Studios&#x27; The Callisto Protocol.

Pittsburgh-based MegaCat Studios has released several low-key titles in its young life, including games for retro platforms such as the NES and the Sega Mega Drive. WrestleQuest represents the indie outfit&#x27;s biggest and most promising title to date, blending strategic RPG combat with the Day-Glo, territory-era world of pro wrestling. Alongside a roster of original characters, WrestleQuest will also star real-world grapplers such as The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter,  Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, Andre the Giant, and Macho Man Randy Savage.
It is reported that MegaCat intends to use Skybound&#x27;s investment to help with the financial side of project development, while also noting that the partnership will give the small studio access to IP and publishing resources. With the release of WrestleQuest just four months away, this exciting venture looks set to propel MegaCat well into 2023 and, hopefully, beyond.
WrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>I asked for no onions on this
The first time I laid eyes on Onion Assault was on the outskirts of GDC back in 2019. I was having a lunch interview with Bertil Hörberg, the solo developer behind the Gunman Clive series and Mechstermination Force. We were there to talk about Mechstermination’s impending release and how its development differed from the Gunman games. In the midst of our conversation, he decided to give me a sneak peek at something else he was working on. It was a new game influenced by the NES classic Super Mario Bros. 2, which I’m sure most of you know was a reskinning of Doki Doki Panic.
This brief, off-the-record preview was merely a morsel, but as a long-time champion of SMB2, I couldn’t wait to see one of my favorite indie developers find inspiration in it.

Whenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it&#x27;s time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it&#x27;s a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.
This is in addition to the current sweepstakes they&#x27;re still running.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Nintendo:
&quot;This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth. The pin set also includes new characters from Fire Emblem Engage: Veyle, Alear…</span>

In case you missed it, the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Greninja event is underway, and there are two opportunities to catch it. Once you do get one just like the prior event Pokemon, they can be bred! Here&#x27;s what you get when you do it.

Bring Greninja and Ditto to a picnic
Just like Charizard and Cinderace, you can hatch an egg with a Ditto and a Greninja at a picnic and create a Froakie. This effectively gets by the &quot;only one Greninja can be caught per save file&quot; restriction for the Tera Raid event.
If you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here. All you need to do is wait and you can create multiple eggs to trade away to folks, or keep for yourself.
[gallery size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360039,360037,360038&quot;]
In Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, Froakie still evolves into Frogadier at level 16, and Greninja at level 36
The evolutionary methodology is the same as the old game line, so you can evolve Froakie into Frogadier (level 16) into Greninja (level 36) on your own terms, and completely raise a brand new Pokemon.
By default, a hatched Froakie comes with the following moves:
Pound (35/35)
Growl (40/40)

                              <span>The road trip adventure gets a musical follow-up
Road 96 was originally released back in 2021 by the creators of Valiant Hearts and 11-11: Memories Retold with its big selling point that it was a procedurally generated narrative game. The story took place in the mid-90s, as characters hitchhiked across the fictional nation of Petria in order to escape its authoritarian regime. While the game didn&#x27;t always stick the landing, it was generally well received, and was considered a successful experiment in trying something totally new when it comes to storytelling in games.

Now, two years after Road 96&#x27;s release, developers Digixart have announced that they&#x27;re working on a prequel, which is titled Road 96: Mile 0 and will take place right before the events of the first game. The story will follow two teenagers, Zoe and Kaito (the former is a character players will recognize from the original Road 96), and will switch between them as their journey challenges &quot;their friendship and everything they believe in.&quot;
Mile 0 will also deviate from its predecessor in that it will include playable musical sections, and if that music is anywhere near as catchy as the song playing over the announcement trailer, we&#x27;ll be in for a treat. Road 96: Mile 0 will release on April 4 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

                              <span>There&#x27;s still time
This is your chance to find Greninja in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, as the weekend events have begun. You&#x27;ll have two chances in total, so don&#x27;t miss your opportunity to grab it! Here&#x27;s how to start (and finish) the process of unlocking it, and how to locate it.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Greninja events start
January 27-January 28, 2023
February 10-February 12, 2023
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven&#x27;t already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360012,360014&quot;]
Locate the Greninja raid on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing poison icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You&#x27;ll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360010,360011&quot;]
Search for a Greninja raid, even if you don&#x27;t have one available
Alternatively, if you don&#x27;t want to host a raid (or don&#x27;t have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Greninja on the list (image silhouette above). As soon as you see it click it: as you&#x27;ll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Greninja raids show up, wait for the &quot;check for new postings&quot; sign to light up: then press X to search again.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn&#x27;t surprising because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network.

As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it&#x27;s likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

Linux kernel developer discussions fizzled out last year over handling this DOIT functionality for what is described as a CPU vulnerability with recent Intel CPUs. However, now a Linux kernel patch from a Google developer would enable this change unconditionally for newer Intel CPUs but raises performance concerns.</span>

Meziroční srovnání kvartálů ukazuje, že došlo k velkému propadu prodejů o 18,3 %, což je nejprudší zaznamenaný propad za jedno čtvrtletí a zároveň to stahuje celkové meziroční prodeje o 11,3 %. Za celý loňský rok se prodalo 1,21 miliardy telefonů, což je nejnižší číslo od roku 2013. Ars Technica to označuje za katastrofu pro trh s telefony a jako příčinu uvádí celosvětově rostoucí inflaci a nezaměstnanost.</span>

                              <span>Hitman 3&#x27;s long-awaited Freelancer mode is finally out, letting you play missions from across the trilogy with randomised objectives and other roguelike elements. Hitman 3 is also now called Hitman: World Of Assassination and its multitude of editions, bundles and DLCs have been combined and simplified. As a result, every Hitman 3 owner now has access to all the levels from Hitman 1 and 2, if they didn&#x27;t already.

Today they launched I Commissioned Some Bunnies, where once again they have commissioned artists to draw pictures with hidden animals to find. Still a big fan of that casual descriptive naming scheme. And yup, the pictures are nice, and the rabbits are hidden, and I&#x27;m happy to have spent £3 on it.

                              <span>Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;, which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie&#x27;s treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: &quot;Wooooaaaah.&quot;
Consider the progress of information. It&#x27;s a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It&#x27;s mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

Patrick Mills was a quest designer on The Witcher 3 and senior quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077 for CD Projekt RED, and shared a neat bit of trivia about The Witcher 3’s wandering merchants on his own account this week. Mills revealed that the script for these lads would dish out fixes whatever stage you were at in the game.

                              <span>Well. They certainly remade Dead Space. With some small but welcome exceptions, Dead Space is a one-to-one remake of the 2008 original.


Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

                              <span>After a mysterious delay from December, arcade racing game Hot Wheels Unleashed will finally arrive on PC Game Pass in early February. I hear it&#x27;s pretty good! It&#x27;s one of the small handful of games Microsoft have confirmed as coming to PC Game Pass in the next fortnight, which also include the JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure fighting game and a return to the subscription service for Darkest Dungeon. Alas, games coming mean games going. Do check out Donut County before it&#x27;s swallowed by the abyss.

                              <span>Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you&#x27;ll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Naughty Dog’s co-president Neil Druckmann commented in a Buzzfeed interview that the company is “moving on” from the Uncharted series, and that they’re not feeling pressured into making The Last Of Us Part III.

                              <span>EA Motive’s Dead Space remake stalks onto PC tomorrow, nearly a decade and a half after the original made us collectively need to buy new pants. Earlier this week, I reported on the possibility of this new take on Dead Space getting an alternate ending. The Reunion ending was leaked by an achievements list for the remake, but now the Dead Space Twitter account has confirmed that the game does indeed feature a secret ending. That’s not all, either.

The post doesn’t go over incoming maps, modes, and features that players can expect to see in Season 02, but the devs say they’ll be sharing more on those nearer to the new season’s kick-off time.

                              <span>Sci-Hub, a shadow library that offers a free gateway to paywalled academic research, has lost control over one of its main domain names. Sci-Hub.se was deactivated by The Internet Foundation in Sweden, which manages the country&#x27;s .se domains. The action came without warning and took Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan by surprise.

Na konci roku 2022 bylo evidováno celkem 1 463 116 domén. Průměrně bylo měsíčně zaregistrováno 17 193 domén, přičemž nejvíce registrací proběhlo v listopadu (23 581) a nejméně pak v červenci (13 199). Na rozdíl od předchozích let byl poprvé v historii zaznamenán propad v počtu domén zabezpečených technologií DNSSEC, který klesl o 1,77 procenta na celkových 844 615; tato skutečnost souvisí především se změnou politiky na straně jednoho z velkých registrátorů.</span>

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…</span>

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us this morning on Twitch at 10 a.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</span>

The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry &quot;a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series.&quot; For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

                              <span>During Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio&#x27;s previous games, it&#x27;s a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games&#x27; Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango&#x27;s other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year&#x27;s Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It&#x27;s directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang&#x27;s latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team&#x27;s base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.</span>

                              <span>ZeniMax Online Studios has revealed the next chapter of The Elder Scrolls Online, and it’s called Necrom. 
Revealed during today’s Xbox Developer Direct, a new games showcase event from the company, The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom brings players to eastern Morrowind, a location studio head Matt Firor says hasn&#x27;t been in an Elder Scrolls game since 1994. 


Players will encounter Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince last seen in the Dragonborn DLC for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in Necrom. Firor also revealed that Necrom will add the Arcanist class to the MMO, which allows players to channel different types of magic, like destructive, restorative, and defensive magic.
If you pre-purchase the Necrom chapter now, you&#x27;ll receive the new Sadrith Mora Spore Steed mount and the Sadrith Mora Spore P…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
&quot;Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you&#x27;ll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone.&quot;

                              <span>Xbox gaming revenue is mostly down across all fronts, but its Game Pass subscriber base still saw growth. 
Microsoft released its second quarter financial results for the 2023 fiscal year yesterday, and it revealed that Xbox gaming revenue declined 13% overall. Xbox content and services, such as first-party software and monetization in third-party games, declined 12%, but Microsoft notes that this decline is up against a &quot;strong prior year comparable.&quot; Given that Xbox&#x27;s 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn&#x27;t surprising.
However, the financial results state that this 12% decline is &quot;partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.&quot; Xbox hardware revenue has also declined 13%. During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Xbox&#x27;s monthly act…</span>

                              <span>Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland&#x27;s resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will &quot;keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life.&quot;

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe &quot;who was in a dating relationship with the defendant.&quot; 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland&#x27;s attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year&#x27;s High On Life.</span>

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games. In terms of who owns the rights to the games, it’s these three companies.”

One of the best non-mechs I&#x27;ve tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it&#x27;s down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

                              <span>Beijing-based outfit Edifier have been making some of the best value computer speakers for a while now; in fact my roundup over at Digital Foundry dedicates two of the seven slots to their designs. One that doesn&#x27;t feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they&#x27;ve ever been before.

For example: Redfall, the open world co-op vampire shooter from Arkane, now has a release date. You&#x27;ll be able to find out exactly how much like Far Cry it is on May 2nd.

                              <span>So those Tango Gameworks leaks turned out to be true. After repeatedly stating that this evening&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It&#x27;s a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there&#x27;s an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it&#x27;s out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

                              <span>The original Pharaoh, released in 1999, was a lot of people&#x27;s first citybuilder. In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I&#x27;m the dad now, and the &quot;full remake&quot; Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

                              <span>A fast-paced game that&#x27;s all about reflecting bullets back with a katana sounds great to me, a known fan of parrying projectiles. I bought new indie game Agent In Depth within 20 seconds of seeing it. Then I played it. Oh no. I feel old. Am I too old? What I can tell you is, if you like fast-paced action platformers with bullets to parry, instadeath to punish you, and no checkpoints to support you, you might enjoy this. It&#x27;s only £2 to find out.

I adore that giant supercharged engine. I will always pick the cars with that giant supercharged engine. But imagine if someone were standing atop that giant supercharged engine&#x27;s towering intake, and I kicked them off it. Glorious! This week, I must apologise, but circumstances have led us to a choice between two wholly dissimilar things. What&#x27;s better: a pre-boss battle supply cache, or resources too good to use?

                              <span>Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fan of a rhythm game. Something where you can get into a flow state, you know? They can be perfect when you&#x27;ve had a long day and don&#x27;t want to engage brain. The thing is, I don&#x27;t think Thumper is one of those games. Thumper is some kind of sci-fi nightmare in space, and it moves so fast that you can&#x27;t relax for a second.

                              <span>Sneaky new photos taken of the set of Amazon’s Fallout TV adaptation have been shared on Twitter that show one of the retro-futuristic series’ Red Rocket gas stations being built. While the chain’s distinctive rocket doesn’t feature in any of the snaps, all taken by J. Carson in New York state, you can clearly make out the Red Rocket branding on its sign and bright red atomic fuel pumps. The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

                              <span>We’re still a month and a bit away from The Last Of Us Part 1 arriving on PC, but it sounds as though the TV adaptation is doing well enough to land itself a second season. Actor Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last Of Us show alongside Pedro Pascal as Joel, told the BBC that she reckons Season 2 is “pretty likely”. Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There&#x27;s nothing confirmed yet so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see,” she said.

                              <span>Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

                              <span>I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there&#x27;s been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix&#x27;s newfound PC love-in would mean I&#x27;d be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn&#x27;t, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that&#x27;s okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII&#x27;s Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

Oddly, The Day Before’s store page also seems to have disappeared from Steam within the past day.

In a Twitter thread from Microsoft&#x27;s 365 Status account, they said the problems have been caused by “networking configuration issues”, and that a recent network change had been rolled back. It&#x27;s hoped this will solve the access problems people have faced trying to use these services this morning, but lingering issues may still be kicking about.

Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.

                              <span>While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today&#x27;s example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That&#x27;s an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

Rockstar Support have tweeted that a security-related update is coming, but didn&#x27;t give a specific timeframe for it yet.

Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you&#x27;d also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

                              <span>Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it&#x27;s such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could &quot;live the book&quot;. Don&#x27;t bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we&#x27;d be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they&#x27;re achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t want to live in any of the books he&#x27;s been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in them because you&#x27;d only end up being a side character, and that&#x27;s boring.

                              <span>There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

                              <span>Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you&#x27;re given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it&#x27;s your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn&#x27;t most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you&#x27;re tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you&#x27;ll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they&#x27;re all swept away. 
It&#x27;s certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi&#x27;s undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio&#x27;s debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they&#x27;re tipped in your favour.

                              <span>Mimimi Games have been teasing their next stealth strategy game for over two years now, and finally, we know what it is. Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it&#x27;s all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

It&#x27;s still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It&#x27;s such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it&#x27;s out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.

                              <span>Even before the monsters arrived, the USG Ishimura was a nightmare. 


I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

                              <span>You may have already heard that several outlets haven&#x27;t had review code for Forspoken, Squeenix&#x27;s magical parkour isekai game that&#x27;s out today and that some people have already decided they hate because of the dialogue. I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don&#x27;t have code, so no PC review from us for a while.
Like many others - and you too, if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 - I&#x27;ve been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl &quot;lemme get this straight?!&quot; credentials. And you know what? I don&#x27;t hate it!

And if staff suspect people of sharing their passwords, they should be reported too.

                              <span>Last week, The Last of Us&#x27; premiere scored HBO&#x27;s second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, &quot;Infected,&quot; has broken another HBO record.
&quot;Infected&quot; brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week&#x27;s 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network&#x27;s history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the &quot;largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,&quot; which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>EA Motive&#x27;s remake of Dead Space is out later this week, but if you need your fix of Isaac Clarke now, you can purchase the Strange Transmissions Quest Pack in Fortnite today. 
Isaac Clarke joins Fortnite&#x27;s Gaming Legends Series and he can join your locker roster via the new quest pack for $11.99. Strange Transmissions is available now in the Fortnite Item Shop and it allows you to collect the Issac Clarke Outfit and earn up to 1500 V-Bucks, which is essentially how much the pack costs (if you convert V-Bucks into real-world dollars). The pack also includes the RIG Back Bling, the USG Ishimura Back Bling, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe, and the Bench Upgrade Emote, which is built-in to the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe. 
For more Isaac Clarke, watch this extended Dead Space gameplay walkthrough that runs down the remake&#x27;s new features and then watch this new story trailer for Dead Space ahead of the game&#x27;s release this Friday. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Revealed yesterday during a Thunderful stream, SteamWorld Build is a new city-builder set in the SteamWorld universe due out sometime this year on consoles and PC. In it, your goal is to escape a dying planet and the only way to do this is by building a mining town to dig up &quot;vital long-lost technology.&quot; You&#x27;ll need to manage your city as the needs of it, and the citizens living there, grow, and you&#x27;ll have to defend your creation from the deadly creatures that lurk below. 
Check out the SteamWorld Build announcement trailer below:

The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they&#x27;re also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer&#x27;s most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

                              <span>After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven&#x27;t seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one&#x27;s a citybuilder, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s Build that&#x27;s coming out first. 
After all, it&#x27;s been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That&#x27;s right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it&#x27;s a mining and tower defence &#x27;em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it&#x27;s really something special.

                              <span>Thunderful have just unveiled the next game in their excellent SteamWorld series, and it&#x27;s not the one we thought it was going to be. Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It&#x27;s a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it&#x27;s called SteamWorld Build. I&#x27;ve played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s a little bit good. If you just want the facts of what was announced, though, read on below.

                              <span>More than 20 years after The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind arrived on PC, one mod has finally given us the option to ignore all the questing and just enjoy capturing the game’s fantastical scenery on canvas. With the Joy Of Painting mod, you can set up your field easel anywhere in Morrowind, daub some brush strokes on a canvas, and even flog the painting to earn a bit of cash.

So rather than go into detail here about the original game itself (although if you want to hear more about it, I&#x27;ve got something pretty cool in the pipeline for you, so watch this space!), I&#x27;ve decided to use this HYP to talk about the brilliant TV adverts that first brought it to my attention.

Over the weekend, devs Infinity Ward tweeted about Hardcore mode’s imminent comeback in the forthcoming update. Hardcore mode chucks out the game’s HUD, turns on friendly fire, and reduces health to make matches quicker and a little more unpredictable. There&#x27;ll also be some changes to Warzone 2’s DMZ, such as new missions and difficulty tuning.

                              <span>Last month, the U.S. seized dozens of domains for illegally streaming World Cup 2022 matches. The tournament began in November, but according to a Special Agent&#x27;s affidavit, Homeland Security received information on sites illegally streaming World Cup matches in September. HSI affidavits filed in support of the December 2022 domain seizures reveal how that process played out.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR has been delayed. 
PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn&#x27;t an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It&#x27;s a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…</span>

                              <span>Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that &quot;Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.&quot; What&#x27;s your favorite Life Is Strange game?

                              <span>World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.</span>

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She&#x27;s also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

                              <span>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company&#x27;s ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there&#x27;s no official indication that Halo Infinite&#x27;s course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: 
pic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59
January 21, 2023
It&#x27;s a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE&#x27;s version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena&#x27;s career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back.

                              <span>Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it&#x27;s been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it&#x27;s clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward&#x27;s tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if &quot;no HUD&quot; is any indication, it&#x27;ll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

In 2022, the MPA said that a recent iteration of &#x27;Cuevana3&#x27; enjoyed more than 130 million visits in a single month. To date, Hollywood hasn&#x27;t been able to take the site down but could it be damaged by relentless DMCA notices and domain changes?

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced). 
For more, read about what Project Q was going to be here.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting advent…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.
