                              <span>New Blood announces two dates at once
While the date for one game is moving back a few weeks, another is sliding in to take its place. Publisher New Blood confirms that Gloomwood will have its Early Access launch pushed back, with Ultrakill Act 2 taking its spot.
While the immersive sim Gloomwood was set to hit Early Access on August 16, the game will need some extra time to come together. A few issues have cropped up over the last few months, according to a statement, as well as some developers coming down with COVID-19. The team made the decision to push its release date back by three weeks, to September 6.
https://twitter.com/NewBlood/status/1554532639259783168
It&#x27;s a little extra time for those who have been patiently waiting, but from the ash arrives a new launch to take its place. New Blood confirms that the second act of Ultrakill, a retro-inspired FPS inspired by the heydays of the &#x27;90s, arrives on August 16.
Ultrakill, which is in Early Access right now, has an overwhelmingly positive reception so far on Steam&#x27;s user reviews. And while it&#x27;s only $20 at the moment, the price will be going up on August 16 with the launch of Act 2.

Hot swap launches
While Gloomwood fans may be waiting a bit longer for their particular brand of immersive sim, there is at least more Ultrakill on the way to tide them over. And really, both seem to scratch an itch of retro-inspired first-person PC gaming. Just each in their own little way; Gloomwood in sneaking and surviving, and Ultrakill in over-the-top shooter fashion.
It&#x27;s a fun swap that New Blood has done, and I&#x27;m down with it. Plus, Gloomwood also has a pre-alpha demo available on its Steam page right now, if you&#x27;re quite eager to try it out. Ultrakill also has a demo, and Act 1 is currently in Early Access.

                              <span>Free games for a limited time
Google Stadia may not have seen the massive success that the company was hoping for, but almost three years after its launch, the streaming service is still holding on. Now it seems that Google has a plan to get more players onboard, because they&#x27;ve just announced that they have over 120 game trials (and more on the way) that you can hop in and try out right now, no payment or Stadia account required. The catalog includes hit games like Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Little Nightmares, Saints Row: The Third, Terraria, Spiritfarer, and many more. Of course, this deal isn&#x27;t without its stipulations.
The trials may in fact be free, but players&#x27; time with each game is limited from anywhere between 120 minutes to 30 minutes, which is pretty insubstantial depending on which game you&#x27;re playing.
So, it&#x27;s looking like this is a better deal if you&#x27;re already looking to try Stadia — as one Reddit user points out, playing the trials of games like Hotline Miami is actually a great way to see if Stadia&#x27;s streaming will work with your network and hardware.

If you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of money on a console or PC gaming rig, Stadia is a nice option, in theory, assuming that it works for you. Okay so maybe there are a lot of &quot;ifs&quot; at play here, but that never stopped Google, clearly.
Regardless of the logistics, others on Reddit praised the trial model, and said they wished Steam would do the same thing. Games are expensive, and only raising in price, so it makes sense that players would want to try out a game before they commit to dropping some major cash for the full thing. If you&#x27;ve ever looked at Google Stadia and thought, &quot;it&#x27;s a good idea, but...&quot; this is a good no-risk opportunity to give it the ol&#x27; college try.

                              <span>The company tries to cool concerns about $45 Overwatch 2 skins
A survey making the rounds in Overwatch circles has caused quite a commotion over the sequel&#x27;s monetization plans. But Blizzard Entertainment has issued a statement saying the survey is &quot;not indicative&quot; of the final product.
The Overwatch 2 survey, as shared on social media by Twitter user Portergauge, asks some questions about various tiers of skin prices for Overwatch 2. It asks about Legendary skins, priced out at $24.99 or bundled with more cosmetics for more cash, and &quot;Mythic&quot; skins, priced at $44.99.
These supposed $45 skins caused some commotion. Overwatch 2 is moving towards a loot box-less model, and that will mean some different monetization, as the multiplayer is going free-to-play.
Right now though, Blizzard is sayi…</span>

[Update: Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS4/PS5), Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PS4/PS5), and Little Nightmares (PS4) can now be claimed by PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers — and more Yakuza games are on the way.]
Right on cue, the sneaky petes over at Dealabs have leaked Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Plus offerings for the coming month of August — and this one is a real doozy, as subscribers at the Essential tier or higher will bag themselves the fantastic releases Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS4/PS5), Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PS4/PS5), and Little Nightmares (PS4).

                              <span>The long-awaited update is &#x27;making very good progress,&#x27; according to ConcernedApe
While fans have understandably grown impatient waiting for the much-later Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile update, the game&#x27;s creator assures us that it is still on the way. In the latest status check, Eric &quot;ConcernedApe&quot; Barone said on Twitter that 1.5 may be ready before the end of 2022 — a far-off ETA, for sure, but something to latch onto at least.
&quot;The 1.5 update for [Stardew Valley] mobile is making very good progress,&quot; he tweeted. &quot;It should be out before the end of the year. Mobile players... thanks for your patience.&quot;
Update 1.5 includes Ginger Island, a new getaway to explore and expand, as well as numerous improvements to the core game. You can have a fish tank, watch ducks swim, move your bed, sit on chairs, raise ostriches, and try a beach farm layout. The list goes on.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_337736&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot;] Ginger Islands is one of the best parts of Stardew Valley.[/caption]
From the sound of it, all Barone can really do is relay and reiterate information as the Stardew Valley porting team continues working on the expansive update. And, in the meantime, he&#x27;s busy working on his upcoming life-sim game, Haunted Chocolatier.
Whenever the day comes, there&#x27;s going to be a huge sigh of relief. Android and iOS players have been waiting for anything concrete, and with today&#x27;s news, we&#x27;re getting there.
This is the kind of long-lasting game that players (and the creator) can&#x27;t seem to walk away from, and update 1.5, in particular, is a culmination of everything it represents as a wholesome slice-of-life experience. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again — Ginger Island is a highlight, and it&#x27;s wild that it&#x27;s a free update. I loved searching for collectibles.

After hosting an open beta in May, GungHo Online Entertainment and Supertrick Games have announced a new, later-than-expected release window for Deathverse: Let It Die on PS4 and PS5. The hack-and-slash carnage will now have to wait until fall 2022.
As producer Shuji Ishikawa explained on the PlayStation Blog, the team chose to hold Deathverse: Let It Die past its original spring launch &quot;due to the results from the open beta.&quot;
The developers are &quot;working hard to make this game the best it can be,&quot; according to Ishikawa, and part of that means &quot;incorporating the feedback from the open beta survey.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;The total walkable area&quot;
Just how big is the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world compared to the second game? A whopping five times as large, according to the developers.
This raw figure was disclosed via part three of an official developer interview series, featuring Tetsuya Takahashi (senior director and chief creative officer at Monolith Soft), Koh Kojima (producer and director at Monolith Soft), and Genki Yokota (producer and director at Nintendo).
After being asked about the scope of the game, and how big it was intended to be as the third entry in a major series, Kojima laughed, and really let loose just how big the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world really is:
&quot;Come to think of it, we were just talking about this yesterday in the office. That the world would be crazy big for this title. So I actually did the math, and it turns out that the total walkable area in this game is over five times larger than in the second title. It was like... &quot;Yikes!&quot;

Kojima elaborates, citing the hindsight of accumulated knowledge from prior games to really allow this map to sing. This allowed the team to get more &quot;creative&quot; instead of just re-using variations of the same landscape concepts, and cites the danger of over-designing things like &quot;wall pattern&quot; aesthetics, which can cut into development time needed to implement more gameplay. Draw distance was apparently a priority though, and I think that was a good call — despite the limitations of the Switch hardware, the game managed to really surprise me at times with some amazing-looking vistas.

Konami has confirmed that its upcoming retro compendium Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection will utilize rollback netcode for the online mode of TMNT: Tournament Fighters. The new factoid will come as welcome news for long-time fans of the heroes in a half-shell.
The Cowabunga Collection — a compilation that almost seems too good to be true — features a bumper crop of TMNT adventures pulled from arcade, NES, SNES, Genesis, and Game Boy platforms. What this boils down to is hours upon hours of classic brawling, platforming, and fighting action, dating as far back as the halcyon days of 1988, when Turtle Mania first bestowed itself on the world.

Xbox has updated its list of arrivals for this month&#x27;s wave of Xbox Game Pass titles. And between campus management and the expansive wildlands, there&#x27;s a pretty good spread of stuff to do in the first half of August.
Available today on the Game Pass service is Ubisoft&#x27;s Ghost Recon Wildlands, a co-op open-world Tom Clancy shooter. It seems like Wildlands didn&#x27;t really win over hearts when it launched, but at the low price of free for Game Pass subs, it could at least be worth a shot for co-op night.
This week will also see Zachtronics puzzler Shenzhen I/O arrive on Game Pass, on a bit of a somber note. For folks who dig logic, circuits, and the beautiful art of clean, efficient design, that&#x27;s one to watch. And Turbo Golf Racing br…</span>

                              <span>A Wo Long demo? Sign me up!
Given the lower impact of this &quot;summer of gaming&quot; push, I wouldn&#x27;t blame you for forgetting Wo Long, Team Ninja&#x27;s &quot;dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty” in action game form. But once the Wo Long demo comes out, provided that it&#x27;s a blast, you&#x27;ll probably be hearing about it then!
Yep, over on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account, the studio is starting their marketing campaign early, noting that the game will have sorcery elements, as well as online multiplayer, a morale system, a character creator, and more. The last bullet point is the most important: a &quot;gameplay trial in the near future.&quot;
Starting with the pre-launch period for Nioh years back, it&#x27;s been customary for Team Ninja to test out their action game via highly prolific game trials: which also serve as a beta of sorts. It allows the studio to reevaluate their internal meta, adjust things like mechanics, animations, and difficulty curves; and even spotlights quality of life features.
So far it&#x27;s worked out pretty great for them, as both Nioh entries have been bolstered by great beta-to-launch upgrades, and meaty post-launch patches. Given that Wo Long is out in &quot;early 2023&quot; (as of the time of publication), this will be plenty of time to assess and readjust if it is indeed coming &quot;in the near future.&quot;

This week sees the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) return in a physical capacity for the first time in three years. Alongside the greatest fighting game players in the world — duking it out for prize pools, trophies, and bragging rights — fans can also look forward to news, reveals, and other tidbits pertaining to the current crop of competitive scrappers.
Arc System Works, the veteran fighting game developer behind great titles such as Dragon Ball FighterZ, BlazBlue, DNF Duel, and Guilty Gear, has announced that it will be hosting a special presentation on the first day of Evo, offering tournaments attendees the opportunity to play games and bag cool merch, while audiences at home can enjoy exhibition matches, competitions and giveaways, and various other live stream events.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2Y-pBgT2sQQ
The day will be highlighted by a special panel presentation looking at &quot;The Past, Present, and Future of GuiltyGear.&quot; Headed up by series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari, the development team will discuss the quirky fight franchise — sharing stories, spotlighting unused concept material, and fielding questions from members of the GG community. The panel will conclude with non-specific &quot;news&quot; regarding the second season of Guilty Gear Strive, so here&#x27;s hoping that we get a character reveal or two, along with a date for the previously teased crossplay beta.
The Arc System Works Guilty Gear Evo panel kicks off Friday, August 5, at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. You can check out the action over on the official Evo Twitch channel. The weekend promises all sorts of exciting news pertaining to the world of fighting games, and we&#x27;ll be sure to cover as much as we can right here on Destructoid.
Evo 2022 takes place between August 5-7 at the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino.

August is now well underway, and that means were are mere weeks out from the launch of the exciting-looking JRPG Soul Hackers 2. Publisher Atlus has dropped a brand new trailer for the stylish sequel, keeping fans teetering on high fervor ahead of the game&#x27;s official launch on August 26.
The trailer itself does not offer us any new information regarding features or mechanics, it is purely a contextless, narrative affair — its one-minute runtime packed out with more melodrama than you can shake a Sabbath at. Perhaps the one element that stands out the most in this short preview is just how damn good everybody looks. While Shin Megami Tensei is most certainly full of demon-hunting, world-ending plotlines, its various protagonists and antagonists are never too busy to ensure that they look sharp as all hell. It&#x27;s quite literally a franchise trademark at this point.

Soul Hackers 2 will tell the story of specialized “Data Agents” Ringo and Figue, who have been dispatched to Earth to track down Persons of Interest related to an incoming apocalypse. What will follow is a lot of high-drama, social engagement, dungeon-exploring, demon-gathering, and strategic, elemental combat, all dressed up in SMT&#x27;s unmistakably excessive aesthetic. Soul Hackers 2, for lack of a better phrase, simply came out of nowhere. It was only announced five months ago, and now it is just three weeks away from launch.
At least nobody was kept waiting... It is the end of the world, after all.
Soul Hackers 2 launches August 26 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>New episodes of the making-the-band series will debut weekly
If you dig pop songs and narrative adventures, We Are OFK might just be crafting a mix for you. Indie-pop interactive series We Are OFK debuts with its first two episodes on August 18, 2022.
The biopic series follows the members of OFK, a virtual band looking for their big break in the Los Angeles music scene. The interactive animated series takes place over five episodes, with five interactive music videos that double as tracks performed by OFK.
Team OFK, the developers behind the project, includes some multifaceted talent from the gaming, TV, music, and film industries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Mu2iKC4fVDs
In essence, it&#x27;s kind of like an interactive Gorrilaz or Josie &amp; The Pussycats narrative adventure. Episodes will have fully-voiced dialogue and texting interfaces for long-range chats. It also looks like it will have some drama, as these 20-somethings try to make it big while also dealing with heartbreak, music-making, and paying the rent.
The first two episodes debut on August 18, while new episodes premiere weekly afterward on August 25, September 1, and September 8. The season will ultimately be five episodes long.
Spin the record
For collectors, We Are OFK is also getting a couple special physical goodies. One that makes perfect sense is a 2x vinyl, which includes OFK&#x27;s singles, art prints, and some special acoustic tracks. Those acoustic versions can only be heard on the vinyl.

There&#x27;s also a physical version planned for the Nintendo Switch and PS5 versions of We Are OFK, which includes all five chapters and a papercraft version of Debug the cat. I guess Stray is no longer the only cat game on the market.

Both versions arrive via iam8bit, and are currently up for order on the iam8bit site.
We Are OFK premieres on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC via both Steam and Epic on August 18.

The microtransaction system for Diablo Immortal items is somehow getting even more out of hand. We already knew of a theoretical number folks had to hit, and now that theory has been tested: the results are bad for everyone.
As Eurogamer points out, a content creator named jtisallbusiness (embedded below) alleges that they&#x27;ve &quot;spent around $100,000&quot; on the game, and are seeking a refund because they can&#x27;t actually engage in the content. Breaking it down, they&#x27;ve boosted themselves to such a high state that they can&#x27;t matchmake anymore in PVP (which is the most popular endgame activity): and as the leader of their clan and the strongest member, that&#x27;s a problem. To compound the issue, they&#x27;re even on an endgame questline (which was designed and is current in the gam…</span>

                              <span>Mixed results for publisher&#x27;s Q2
Beleaguered publisher Activision Blizzard released its financial results for the second quarter of 2022, presenting a mixed bag of successes and losses for some of the biggest blockbuster franchises in gaming.
Overall, the most recent quarter did not turn around the company&#x27;s recent sliding fortunes, with overall revenue down a huge 28% on the same period last year. Of course, this still equates to total revenue of around $1.64 billion USD for the quarter, so it&#x27;s hardly doomsday for the industry giant. Perhaps more concerning to the studio are the numbers pertaining to its monthly active users, which is down 12% on 2021, equating to a loss of around 361 million players across the publisher&#x27;s various online games.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Mario Kart Switch icons are at the forefront of the Switch Online app this month: and they&#x27;re available now.
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 icons will come in waves, and currently feature main protagonists Noah, Mio, Riku, and several side characters [heroes]. Wave 1 is available until August 4 at 5:59PM PT, and the entire line will cycle out on September 1 at 6PM PT.
As for Mario Kart Switch icons, you can find creations centered around booster course [season] pass waves 1 and 2 now, through September 5 at 6PM PT. Animal Crossing September birthday characters are part of the rollout too, and run through September 5 at 6PM PT.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

The third dimension wasn’t very kind to the platformer. It was heavily ridiculed within its own medium, then quietly died shortly after the turn of the millennium. However, there were enough classic titles that linger in the minds of old people like me. It’s no surprise that we’ve seen a surge of callback titles in the indie circuit like A Hat in Time and Demon Turf.
Frogun knows what it’s about. With its lo-fi PS1-styled visuals and cute mascot character, it wouldn’t look out of place on the console’s collection of platformers. Of course, there’s more than just looking the part, and fortunately, Frogun acts the part, as well. Or is that entirely a good thing?

NetherRealm Studios&#x27; creative director Ed Boon has shut down online rumors that the studio is preparing to reveal a brand new entry in the Mortal Kombat series at this weekend&#x27;s Evolution Championship Series (Evo) tournament.
As is always the case with MK, the rumors of the reveal came about because someone decided that they existed. Social media quickly started turning up the volume on whispers that Warner Bros. Games and NRS were preparing to reveal Mortal Kombat 12 during this week&#x27;s Evo festivities. Speaking on Twitter yesterday, however, the usually enigmatic Boon chose to be more direct, openly squashing the reveal talk.
After IGN noted that several fighting game brands would be in attendance at Evo, including Mortal Kombat, Boon retweeted IGN&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Time to light up Night City
Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners got a new trailer today, and it looks both gorgeous and full of action. Today&#x27;s trailer lets us meet some of the main cast and see the set-up for the action, as well as how Night City is being adapted into anime form.
Anime fans who didn&#x27;t already know will probably notice right away that Studio Trigger is at the helm. Trigger is the studio behind productions like Promare and Kill la Kill, and boy, does it show in this new trailer. The fast action, berating line reads, and gorgeous style bleeds through in the new Edgerunners trailer.
It does, also, take some quieter moments. The story looks to follow David as he gets tied up in the back-alley gigs of Night City.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OiR_lMNlJko
Alongside an incredible adaptation of the world and design, based off the tabletop RPG, Studio Trigger also seems to be taking cues from CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077. The call tone, for instance, is the same one used in the video game. And a few of the vistas we see in the trailer are very similar to their 2077 look.
A cyberpunk future
Netflix has had some hits and some misses in the video game adaptation department as of late. On one hand, Castlevania is one of their big series and is currently headed into the Richter Belmont era. And League of Legends series Arcane has been absolutely stellar. But Dragon&#x27;s Dogma didn&#x27;t do quite as well on the animated front.
This is Studio Trigger, though, and I think that plus the potential of a good Cyberpunk adaptation is enough reason to tune in. There is still some Cyberpunk 2077 content on the way somewhere down the line, though CD Projekt Red seems like it&#x27;s mostly moving towards The Witcher for the future. I&#x27;m very much into Trigger&#x27;s take on Night City, though.
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners hits Netflix next month, in September 2022.

The flashy sword-slashing action game 34Everlast has an eye-catching look and an even more interesting conceit. According to developer Ogami, players will be able to &quot;complete the game in as little as 10 minutes, so you can finish it before you go to bed.&quot;
In other words, 34Everlast is &quot;super-concentrated action entertainment for the gamers of the past who are exhausted from work.&quot; You&#x27;ve gotta see the trailer (via Gemtasu).

The game&#x27;s bullet points all lean into the time-is-precious hook:
AAA-style game you can buy and complete before bed on a weeknight.
No tutorial, easy controls, and exhilarating action!
No stressful game over even if you lose to a boss.

This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

                              <span>Herschel &quot;Guy&quot; Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a &quot;AAA game studio&quot; with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio&#x27;s first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it&#x27;s a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society&#x27;s first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it&#x27;s less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games.

As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t help that Beahm tweeted, &quot;I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine&quot; back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty&#x27;s visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen.

Even if you&#x27;ve made it rich in Sea of Thieves and are loaded to the gills in gold, you can only purchase one of each type of ship: the Sloop, Brigantine, and Galleon. Within the teaser video above, we see the Sloop goes for 250,000 gold, the Brigantine for 375,000, and the four-person Galleon at 500,000. Once one of these vessels is yours for the keeping, you can give it a name, and it&#x27;ll appear on a wooden plaque on the ship&#x27;s crest.

You might spend the time sightseeing, of course, wandering the streets with Google Maps at your side and trying depserately to not look quite so &quot;touristy&quot;. You could relax in your hotel, read a book, watch a bit of Countdown, or simply chill out in the lobby with your trusty Switch while sipping on a caramel latte.

                              <span>DigiDestined for greatness.
The long wait for Digimon Survive is finally over, with players at last able to dive into this unusual entry in the series. Fans expecting the usual fare from a Digimon game might be understandably disappointed, but for those with an appetite for visual novels and tactical RPG combat, there is plenty to get your teeth sunk into here. It might not be the best Digimon game you can buy, but it is certainly one of the best visual novels to come out this year. From the writing to the visuals, this is an exceptional title, provided you know what you&#x27;re getting ahead of time.
While it features creatures familiar to Digimon fans, this title stands as a departure in tone and genre from previous instalments. Digimon Survive serves as a mystery visual novel with surprisingly dark imagery. Particularly in the opening chapters, the game is closer to a horror story than we certainly expected. There are even a few jump scares mixed in to contend with.

Amidst a weak yen in Japan, electronics are currently facing some serious price hikes, including the likes of Apple&#x27;s iPhone, but also emcompassing a wide range of pretty essential goods including TVs, fridges, dishwashers, and printers.
One area that seems to be immune (for now) is the video game console market. According to Bloomberg (thanks, VGC), the three major console manufacturers - Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft - were asked whether a price increase is on the cards in Japan in the near future. While Sony and Microsoft conspiciously declined to comment, Nintendo stated quite plainly that it has &quot;no plans&quot; to raise Switch prices.

                              <span>And it looks really official.
Minecraft brings out so much creativity within the community. We can&#x27;t count how many times we&#x27;ve been blown away by people&#x27;s creations in this huge sandbox game over the years, and we&#x27;ve dreamt of seeing more Nintendo-related implementations within the game, especially after the official 3DS Minecraft got its own Super Mario Mash-Up.
Inspired by that very creation, @StephenJPlant has created a Zelda: Wind Waker pack for Minecraft on PC. The pack is a 16x16 resolution creation, which was a deliberate choice from the creator, as it matches the Super Mario one (that was also made for the Wii U).

It&#x27;s another nail in the coffin for the Wii U. Nintendo Everything reports that two video apps for the console — YouTube and Crunchyroll — will be ending support later this year.
Anime subscription platform Crunchyroll will be discontinued on the Wii U from 29th August — with emails being sent out about the end of the service last week. YouTube will last a little bit longer, with the app ending support in October, as mentioned in a statement on Google Support.

Publisher Team17 is bringing Hokko Life to Switch this September! If you remember as far back as 2020, we talked about this game as having some serious Animal Crossing vibes, and now it&#x27;s hopping over to a Nintendo platform on the 27th September.
Developed by Wonderscope Games, Hokko Life has been in Steam Early Access since July 2021 and, since then, has seen a ton of updates that bring more customisation, more skills, and even a little bit of Stardew Valley into the mix. You can visit a distant city centre (think City Folk!), unlock perks to make village life just a bit easier, and craft and customise clothes, furniture, and more!

                              <span>It’s time to hop into action.
At a time when game developers are consistently striving to create something photorealistic and fully immersive, we begin to lose touch with the games that kept us up at night as kids. Luckily Molegato, the developer of Frogun, kept this in mind as this crisp, retro-style puzzle platformer came to fruition.
The story of Frogun follows Renata, the friendly, outgoing, excitable daughter of two world-renowned explorers. But when she’s left at her family&#x27;s base camp for a handful of days, she takes it upon herself to rescue her parents from the Beelzebub ruins — the most dangerous expedition her family has gone on yet. So, placing faith in her trusty Frogun (a frog-shaped invention that can grab onto anything with its tongue), Renata sets off to the ruins in an attempt to find her parents.

Scarlet and Violet are, of course, heading to the Nintendo Switch on November 18th, 2022, and while we already know quite a hefty amount about the new mainline games, The Pokémon Company clearly has a few surprises up its sleeve for its latest broadcast.

If you&#x27;re a long-standing Xenoblade series fan, then you&#x27;re probably used to hearing the same lines of dialogue over and over again, whether it&#x27;s post-battle, or when opening a chest or gathering items.
Xenoblade Chronicles has a few of these — who can forget &quot;I&#x27;m really feeling it?&quot; from Shulk, something we abuse constantly here at Nintendo Life when we&#x27;re covering Xenoblade news. And &quot;Now it&#x27;s Reyn time&quot; has also entered the pantheon of video game memes. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 had even more, including a couple of lines — &quot;Think you can take me?&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t forget me&quot; — that were edited in a patch.

Logitech G, the gaming branch of the Swiss peripheral giant Logitech, has announced that it has partnered with Tencent Games to work on a dedicated cloud-based handheld device.
As reported by The Verge, the system is currently very much in active developement, and nothing has been announced at this time regarding release date, pricing, or what the system will actually look like. What we do know, however, is it will be a handheld alternative to smart phone peripherals and will support services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia’s GeForce Now, with Logitech and Tencent working with both Microsoft and Nvidia on the hardware.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s console was conspiciously absent from the reveal.
When the upcoming wrestling game AEW: Fight Forever was announced by publisher THQ Nordic, the Switch was noticably absent from the line-up of target hardware. However, a fresh listing on Amazon UK suggests that the title may be heading to Nintendo&#x27;s system after all.
Noticed and posted by Gematsu on Twitter, the listing states a placeholder date of December 31st, 2022 at a standard price of £49.99.

The Super Mario Land series for the original Game Boy might not necessarily be quite as well known as the major entries on consoles, but it was also an introduction to the world of Mario for many Nintendo fans at the time.
Unfortunately, we only got three entries in this series, and from the third game onwards, Wario sort of hijacked the entire series. If you&#x27;ve ever wondered though what the Super Mario Land series might have looked like if it did make it to the GBA generation - with Mario and Luigi at the helm, here you go.

Nintendo has just announced the Switch Online game Tetris 99 will be hosting its 30th Maximus Cup. It kicks off this Friday on 5th August and will give players a &quot;second chance&quot; at unlocking themes they may have missed out on before.
Instead of having to earn 100 event points for each theme, this time around you&#x27;ll only have to earn 10 event points per round - meaning you can quickly snap up multiple themes one after the other. Here&#x27;s a bit of PR about it:

                              <span>To reduce piracy on the Switch console, last week Nintendo used a DMCA notice to target a popular &#x27;sigpatch&#x27; repository on Github. While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

Pár týdnů práce vývojářů (no, vlastně jde prakticky jen o Gerta Wollnyho) nyní vyústilo v rozšíření této funkcionality i na starší modely. Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a lot of stuff to get to!
It&#x27;s almost impossible to narrow down a top five list of most iconic Mario Kart tracks — but this Mario Kart 8 Deluxe track list is doing a good job of showing us what&#x27;s missing.
Crafted by Azer_FR over on reddit, the list breaks down multiple games, and lists tracks that have and have not appeared in Deluxe. There&#x27;s even denotations for tracks that have been reused, or have never appeared again in any future game (and thus would be more ideal for preservation in Deluxe).
It&#x27;s interesting seeing everything broken down game by game. It feels like there should be more Super Mario Kart/SNES tracks in Deluxe, but there&#x27;s only three! Nintendo better pump those numbers up eventually. I always had a feeling that Mario Kart Tour was super represented, but seeing it on paper is something else.
Beyond that, everything seems to be pretty well spread out across the rest of the series. Maybe we could use some more Double Dash (especially since it has some unique tracks that haven&#x27;t seen the light of day again)? But other than that, Nintendo has given each game a decent amount of representation.
As a note, the red exclamation mark (!) icon denotes tracks that were just recently confirmed to be part of &quot;Wave 2&quot; of the Booster Course [Season] Pass. We have four more waves to get to by the end of 2023, so there&#x27;s plenty on the way.

                              <span>Escaping these rooms is a good time, but I&#x27;d recommend a friend
A few weeks ago, indie puzzler Escape Academy went live. It&#x27;s a new addition to a growing collection of escape room-styled puzzle games, and it&#x27;s a genuinely good time. It is a bit better if you bring a friend along for the ride, though.
I had originally planned to play through Escape Academy with a friend. Last year&#x27;s Operation: Tango or even games like A Way Out made co-op mandatory, and I found that doing puzzles together is a fun way to build teamwork. While, y&#x27;know, also competing and finding out bizarre things about each other.
So Escape Academy seemed like a perfect new game to co-op together. Life circumstances arose though, and while we managed to play some of the earliest levels together, I wound up having to solo th…</span>

                              <span>The wait might be finally over
It&#x27;s been over two years, and I, like many others out there, have still yet to secure a PS5. While I&#x27;ve been resigned to a life without the newest console due to bots, scalpers, and other customers that have faster internet than me, it seems there might finally be hope for those of us who still don&#x27;t have a console.
According to a new financial report from Sony published on July 29, they have plans to reach their projection of 18 million units sold in 2022. There was also a detail included in the report that there have been &quot;significant improvements&quot; to Sony&#x27;s supply chain, meaning the issues that have been plaguing the PS5&#x27;s production may well be coming to a close. Most importantly, the company said that they&#x27;re &quot;working to bring-forward more supply into the year-end holiday selling season.&quot;
Sounds like it should be smooth(er) sailing for consumers as the months go on.

I&#x27;ve even heard anecdotes recently of the PS5 not selling out instantly once it becomes available through Sony, so there&#x27;s a chance we&#x27;re already seeing the positive effects of supply chain improvements.
I personally gave up the search a long time ago, mostly because there aren&#x27;t a ton of games out there I&#x27;ve been itching to play that have been released just yet, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wouldn&#x27;t jump at the chance to play Returnal or Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart if given the chance. It&#x27;s like, my backlog is big enough I don&#x27;t need to play those games right now, but I&#x27;d like to, you know?
Anyway, it&#x27;s pretty heartening to hear I won&#x27;t have to panic my way through a PS5 purchase in the coming months. I might just have to buy one for myself as a Christmas present -- and a pink controller and console cover while I&#x27;m at it.

                              <span>Ah instructional manuals, I missed you old friends
Thanks to a My Nintendo update, strategy booklets for Mario Strikers Switch are on the menu, hearkening back to the bygone era of manuals.
For the sum total cost of zero platinum points, you can download the strategy booklets for Mario Strikers Switch yourself. There&#x27;s two in total: one that goes over basic techniques, and another that focuses on advanced mechanics. Both of them run the gamut of the game&#x27;s tutorial system, and really, the advanced booklet isn&#x27;t a bad thing to have near you as you&#x27;re learning the game.
Interestingly, they fold in such a way that they can be turned into actual booklets. They even have a full page dedicated to folding and cutting! If you&#x27;re game for a crafting project that requires identifying &quot;mountain fold lines and valley fold lines&quot; you&#x27;re set this afternoon. As an added bonus: Thankfully, Nintendo has crafted the booklets to ensure they can both be stored in the actual Mario Strikers: Battle League case.
If only you could order physical manuals for every first-party Nintendo game
I get wanting to cut down on environmental footprints, but providing a &quot;print on demand&quot; service for manuals sounds like a really interesting potential market opportunity. Even if they were sparing and linked to the My Nintendo physical goods system, there&#x27;s something there.

One of the perks of physical game ownership is being able to display your shiny new box on a shelf amongst your game collection. And if the base box art of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 isn&#x27;t fitting in, or you&#x27;d just like some options, a new MyNintendo reward has you covered.
Over on the MyNintendo page, a collection of three alternative box arts for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is available now. The collection will run you 30 Platinum Points. It&#x27;s available now through February 1, 2023, so you&#x27;ve got time to consider them.
Once you&#x27;ve redeemed the reward, getting your new art is pretty straightforward. Just download the files and print them on a color printer at actual size, on 8.5 x 11&quot; (letter-sized) paper. Nintendo recommends using Gloss Text-type papers.

Three Xenoblade Chronicles 3 classes are tougher to find than all the others. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of how to pick them all up.
[Note that there will be no specific story spoilers below, but locations will be named, as will names of quests and classes (without proper character names).]
How to find the Machine Assassin in Xenoblade Chronicles 3
So this is by far the hardest class to find in the game, as it requires multiple quest chains. Note that you likely shouldn&#x27;t attempt this until you&#x27;re at least level 50, so you can just go back and eventually close this one out: or do some of the required quests along the way.

Sony plans to drop support for the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5, and if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 and you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m referring to, you aren&#x27;t alone. Accolades were intended as a way for PS5 players to show &quot;appreciation&quot; for others in online multiplayer games.
Users can send Accolades like Helpful, Good Sport, Leader, and Welcoming as a little feel-good post-match moment, and the badges are listed in player profiles.
A nice idea in theory, right? Well, in a new notice posted today, Sony said it would discontinue PS5 Accolades due to lower-than-anticipated usage.

                              <span>Classic shmups jetting to these shores
ININ Games has confirmed that both Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology and RayStorm x RayCrysis HD Collection will both be released in western territories. The remastered shmup classics will release in North America, Europe, and other territories at some unspecified point following their Japanese release.
As previously reported, Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology — currently scheduled for launch in Japan in March 2023 — is a compendium of series classics gathered together for PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The collection will include RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996), and RayCrisis (1998). Also included are two brand new remasters, RayCrisis HD and RayStorm NEO-HD. The latter title is itself a remaster of a remaster, boosted with new extra features and vital 16:9 monitor support.
RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection, which seems a strangely redundant alternate collection, will apparently include all of the same titles listed above but will omit the original RayForce.

RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection will be made available digitally and physically, while Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology will launch digitally worldwide and will receive an exclusive physical release via boutique outlet Strictly Limited Games. This edition features a boxed release of the game alongside additional collectible memorabilia including a CD soundtrack, a strategy guide, old-school arcade-style stickers, a hardcover art book, and other neat goodies.

Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology and RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection are currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch We will be sure to give you a heads up when new information regarding western launch dates is made available.

                              <span>And Illaoi will be one of the fighters on-board
Evo 2022 kicks off this weekend. But before the fighting game festivities get underway, Riot Games is updating fans on the status of its own fighting game code-named Project L. It&#x27;s also confirming that Project L will be free-to-play.
A new dev diary for Project L was published this morning, with developer Tom Cannon talking a bit about where the project is at. The team has been hard at work on development over the months since its last showing, spotlighting its assist features.
As the team continues to grow both its roster and features, Cannon confirms that the new Riot game will be a free-to-play title.

&quot;One of our goals is to remove as many barriers as possible from you enjoying Project L,&quot; Canno…</span>

                              <span>For the Summer 2022 edition
It&#x27;s no Nintendo Power, but the latest translated Nintendo Magazine issue just arrived online, directly from the aforementioned publisher.
The magazine, which serves largely as a marketing tool, is printed physically in Japan — but a new tweet from Nintendo has provided a digital version that&#x27;s been fully translated into English. The focus of this issue, appropriately, is &quot;summer,&quot; with Kirby serving as the cover story. Given that Forgotten Land starts on a beach, it seems like a good match.
Here are some highlights from the Summer 2022 translated Nintendo Magazine:
A 30th anniversary Kirby special with a giant timeline
A spread on Nintendo Switch Sports and Ring Fit Adventure, with workout poses to try
&quot;Summer&quot; themed looks at Pokemon Legends and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
A Mario Strikers: Battle League personality test
A quick look at all six main characters from Xenoblade Chronicles 3
A cute in-universe Splatoon 3 Squid Ecology Research Memo
A micro-calendar for July, August, and September
You can find the full magazine here. Note that going to the bottom right and selecting &quot;contents&quot; will let you jump around.
Ideally, Nintendo does this for all issues of pretty much anything they make. It might take time to translate them, but given the positive response so far, it seems worth the effort.

                              <span>Prázdniny pokračují a i když okurková sezóna je v plném proudu, technických novinek je požehnaně. I přes slunce lákající k výletům stále pátráme v internetovém prostoru po nových zajímavostech, které bychom Vám přinesli. A jaké to budou?

Jak poznat nebezpečná USB-C zařízení, která vám zapálí telefon a z domu udělají kůlničku na dříví. Jaké se objevily nové mikrokontroléry - konkurenti ESP32, levná a dostupná RISC-V, schopné 8051čky a jak se vůbec mikrokontroléry vyvíjely posledních 50 let. Dobrej hárdvér, a co softvér?

Ale ovšem, máme tu nový KiCAD 6.0.7, hustý update FW pro Průša Mini s podporou WiFi, NodeRED pro ESP, IR ovládání hloupých klimatizací a jejich integrace do smart domácnosti. Je to vše?

Není Horste! To je jen ochutnávka aktualit, o kterých Vám můžeme něco říct. Mnohem více témat máme v záloze, ale hlavně můžete přijít Vy sami s vlastními tématy - právě o tom Virtuální Bastlírna totiž je!

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 3. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL&#x27;s excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

                              <span>While the Tour De France Femmes ended on Sunday and the Tour Hommes the week before, I&#x27;ll not be rushed on my own Tour De Jeux. I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

                              <span>We&#x27;re going on a summer vacation.
One of the games we&#x27;re most excited for this month is Shin-Chan: Me And The Professor On Summer Vacation – The Endless Seven-Day Journey — yes, the title really is that long. The game is inspired by the My Summer Vacation series and has been developed by the same team, Millennium Kitchen.
Originally released in Japan last year, we didn&#x27;t expect we&#x27;d ever see it in the West. But we were pleasantly surprised a few months ago when publisher Neos Corporation revealed the game would be coming out in English this summer! One of the biggest reasons we were surprised is that none of the My Summer Vacation games made their way over to the West, but we still wanted to celebrate the upcoming Shin-Chan game&#x27;s release by playing one of Millennium Kitchen&#x27;s games. And, so, we did.

Konami has delivered more good news for Turtles fans today. At the end of the month, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection will be launching on Switch. And the compilation&#x27;s publisher has revealed that one game is getting some modern-day enhancements to help with online play.
Of the 13 games included in the Cowabunga Collection, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters for SNES will be getting rollback netcode! This fighting game got three different versions back in the day — one on NES, SNES, and Mega Drive Genesis, and all three are on the collection — but so far the company has only revealed that the SNES game is getting the modern-day fighting game essential.

                              <span>Is &quot;more of the same&quot; going to be enough?
Splatoon 3 is just a handful of weeks away from launch, with the sequel heading to the Switch on September 9th. Despite the fact that Nintendo has been drip-feeding bits of news here and there on Twitter, including new songs, gear reveals, and new multiplayer maps, there&#x27;s a distinct feeling amongst the community that the marketing around the game has been a bit lacklustre.
It&#x27;s no surprise, either. The launch of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has understandably taken up a lot of Nintendo&#x27;s time over the past few weeks, with the company bombarding fans with new trailers, gameplay footage, interviews, and more. Now that the game is out, though, can we expect Nintendo to shift its focus over to Splatoon 3? Well, yes, theoretically. That hasn&#x27;t stopped some fans from getting quite worried, though, particularly in the wake of a new Pokémon Presents being announced for later this week (though we fully acknowledge that this is more of a Pokémon Company event rather than a Nintendo one):

                              <span>Gotham Knights will finally hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC too, in just a few months – Oct. 25 to be exact – and Warner Bros and WB Montreal have been steadily releasing more and more information about the multiplayer Bat-family game. 
Today, as part of IGN First coverage, the studio released the first 16 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay and the focus is exclusively on Batgirl. If you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, don&#x27;t fret – there&#x27;s not much revealed story-wise in this gameplay, but it does feature a look at the first mission as well as some of the in-game mechanics we&#x27;ll be utilizing to solve mysteries and fight crime. According to the video, this takes place right after the prologue. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Gotham Knights, be sure to watch this Batgirl-centric trailer and then check out this one detailing some of Robin&#x27;s moveset. After that, check out Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s executive producer and director for details about alternate suits, missions, and the Elseworlds-like cooperative play.

If it&#x27;s like past presentations, we&#x27;ll likely get a trailer or two for the upcoming ninth generation of Pokémon as well as new details regarding the world of these games. I&#x27;m hoping we get a look at the mid-stage evolutions of the starters and more information about the region.

                              <span>Disney revealed back in May that its upcoming Rogue One prequel series, Andor, would premiere on Disney Plus on Aug. 31. Disney has delayed its release by a few weeks as it will now premiere on Sept. 21. However, on Sept. 21, three episodes will go live. 
This news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney. Running nearly two and a half minutes long, this trailer sets up the beginning of a rebellion led by Andor and others such as Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma (all played by the actors that portrayed them in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). You can check it out for yourself below: 


Elsewhere, Disney also released a fancy new illustrated poster for Andor today:

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. 
One of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. 
“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” 
If you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. 
You’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).
In the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review.

This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>SmoothStreams - one of the most reliable and well-known pirate IPTV providers  - suddenly went offline this month. A two-week TorrentFreak investigation has determined that members of MPA-Canada and ACE, including Bell and Rogers, have been tracking the service&#x27;s operators for years. Legal action is already underway, but the process isn&#x27;t going exactly to plan.

                              <span>All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA&#x27;s official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don&#x27;t think so, you can call into Madden NFL&#x27;s ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA&#x27;s snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA&#x27;s involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...
@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ

89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!
#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE

Yo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!

The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year&#x27;s ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player&#x27;s rating? We&#x27;ll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I&#x27;d call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
EA Sports PGA Tour
First announced in 2021 with a Spring 2022 launch window, PGA Tour marks EA’s return to making golf games after a years-long hiatus. The publisher nabbed exclusive rights to the Masters Tournament and the game even includes the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t know much more about the game besides a few courses and events, and EA has on…</span>

                              <span>One of the allures of PC gaming is building your rig to the specs you need. Last year, while I didn&#x27;t pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT&#x27;s streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.
If you don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.

                              <span>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23&#x27;s on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We&#x27;ll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix&#x27;s Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA&#x27;s Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>&quot;A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.&quot; This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game&#x27;s fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can&#x27;t dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game&#x27;s other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 03 update, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</span>

                              <span>Piracy lawsuits should be pretty straightforward. Rightsholders must provide solid evidence that someone shared a copy of their content without permission. However, in a piracy case filed by adult entertainment company Strike 3 the purported &quot;Hollywood style quality&quot; of the porn videos is now a topic of contention.

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

                              <span>During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

                              <span>Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as &quot;angry playmobil&quot;. I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

                              <span>Earlier this month, RPS turned 15 years old, so it only seemed right that this month&#x27;s Time Capsule entry should be the year of our birth: 2007. Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

Čeká vás odpoledne workshopů a přednášek věnovaných Fedoře, kde se budete mít šanci seznámit a diskutovat s dalšími vývojáři, přispěvateli a uživateli. Pokud byste se chtěli zapojit jako přednášející, během odpoledne se budou sbírat návrhy na lightning talky, které program uzavřou. Poté jsou všichni účastníci vítáni na večerním posezení u piva v brněnském Technologickém Parku.</span>

The upside is that they&#x27;re going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

Weird alien birds, colourful landscapes, pure whimsey, and charm - there was a lot going on. Just watch the trailer below to see for yourself.

                              <span>First-person indie survival horror The Lost Wild was one of the standout games featured in today’s Annapurna Interactive showcase. It has plenty of that most scary of things: big, toothy dinosaurs. Watch the trailer below to see for yourself, but bring along some anti-lizard flares.

                              <span>Today saw indie publisher Annapurna Interactive’s second showcase, highlighting all the new games that you can expect from them over the course of the next year and beyond. There was some fresh gameplay for Thirsty Suitors and Hindsight, plus a newly revealed game from Wilmot’s Warehouse devs Hollow Ponds. We were treated to a few glimpses at what Kentucky Route Zero team Cardboard Computer and If Found… devs Dreamfeel are working on too. The latter involves cats.
Don’t fret if you didn’t catch the Annapurna Interactive stream today, because we’ve got all the info you need to know right here. Read on!

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

                              <span>Alice is away this week, leaving the lads to their own devices to discuss the best nice blokes in video games. A coincidence? Who can say. What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

                              <span>A lot of people love cats, as cyberpunk moggy sim Stray showed us when it launched last week. Now, you can enjoy Stray together with some buddies and/or pals thanks to a new multiplayer mod for the game. This is classic stuff people, because we’re talking splitscreen local co-op.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

                              <span>The world’s greatest detective who isn’t Batman will once again tangle with the many-tentacled forces of darkness in an upcoming remake of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

                              <span>I really appreciate when games don&#x27;t hold your hand. They don&#x27;t waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

                              <span>An update to Minecraft: Java Edition is causing frustration among players over the possibility of being kicked out of their own private servers. Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

                              <span>Hear me out a minute. Imagine Sherlock Holmes, but instead of a pompous eccentric, he’s a well-mannered, top hat-wearing... giraffe. And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder! It’s a point-and-click affair where you use Talk/Use/Look actions to interact with the environment while also dragging and dropping things from your inventory bar into the world to use them. It’s classic point-and-click through and through.

Cue Stray In Doom, which sends Doomguy off for a rest to let a sweet little kitty frag some demons in his stead.

In preparation, a Florida federal court has set some rules for what can and what can&#x27;t be brought up before the jury. Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can&#x27;t freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

RCMP officers raided GaloTV (Soltv) in 2021, seizing hundreds of set-top boxes, receivers and broadcasting devices. One of the men was previously sued by DISH and agreed to settle a civil suit for more than half a billion dollars.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.</span>

                              <span>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.
A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</span>

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. 


Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you&#x27;re not blasting apart enemies, you&#x27;ll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister&#x27;s wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex&#x27;s emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala&#x27;s mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It&#x27;s a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you&#x27;re still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade&#x27;s most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.
A dev diary during today&#x27;s Annapurna Showcase doesn&#x27;t reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog&#x27;s face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy. 
Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero here.</span>

                              <span>During February’s Nintendo Direct, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got a lot of overdue attention with the announcement of 48 race tracks – new and old – coming to the arcade racer by 2023. The first wave dropped in March alongside a 2.0 update. Wave 2 is just around the bend and promises the Turnip and Propeller Cups next month. This means we’re getting some familiar courses across multiple consoles, including the Super NES, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, Wii, and Mario Kart Tour games. Here are the details for each cup based on a recent press release:

According to the official PlayStation blog, Extra and Premium members can download/play Kazuma Kiryu&#x27;s classic, crime-riddled journeys in Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 next month. Later this year, those same subscribers get access to Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, and Yakuza 6: The Song of Life.

It’s Tuesday morning. I’m late. I’ve missed the embargo deadline for Rollerdrome. Across the games press, website authors have already published previews and stories about their time playing Roll7’s blood-packed sports title. 
But I can’t stop playing Rollerdrome. 
Instead of writing, I once again queue the Barbican Arena competition, the last leg in my six-level demo. The level begins in a long, claustrophobic tunnel lit in red light. I have everything I need – rollerskates and a shotgun – to put on the show of a lifetime. Ahead of me are echoes of a crowd clapping in unison, an ominous metronome inv…</span>

                              <span>Since the disclosure of Retbleed earlier this month as the newest CPU security vulnerability around speculative execution, I&#x27;ve posted some Intel/AMD benchmarks looking at the mitigation cost for the affected older generations of processors. Last week I also looked at the accumulated CPU mitigation cost on AMD Zen 1. Today is a similar comparison over on the Intel Xeon E3 v5 &quot;Skylake&quot; side with looking at the cost of just the Retbleed mitigations and then the overall CPU mitigation cost when toggling all of the various vulnerabilities with the &quot;mitigations&#x3D;off&quot; flag.</span>

                              <span>In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play a new Bayonetta game in just a few short months. But hey, let&#x27;s not forget the classics, either. 
Today on Game Informer Live, we&#x27;re revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive people will say is one of the best games of all time. 
But that&#x27;s not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the first and second archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we&#x27;re finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together. 
We&#x27;re going live on our Twitch page at 3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!</span>

The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game&#x27;s design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …</span>

The three games will be available on August 2, which means July&#x27;s titles – Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon – are leaving. You have until August 1 to download last month&#x27;s free games. In any case, here&#x27;s what you can expect from this month&#x27;s three titles:

                              <span>The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

                              <span>When I sat down to talk to Wadjet Eye founder Dave Gilbert last week, he was in the middle of trying to sum up The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a new point and click adventure from Cloak And Dagger Games that his studio will be publishing later this year. &quot;Usually, by the time a game comes out, I&#x27;ve compressed it to one sexy sound bite. I haven&#x27;t done that with Hob&#x27;s Barrow yet,&quot; he says. &quot;Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it.&quot;
Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce &quot;Incantamentum&quot; correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. &quot;I said, &#x27;Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you&#x27;re going to be adding voice acting to this because it&#x27;s screaming for it&#x27;,&quot; Gilbert tells me. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, we will if we can find a publisher who&#x27;ll do it for us.&#x27;&quot; So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998&#x27;s terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser.

                              <span>More information about Rockstar’s next Grand Theft Auto game has slipped out of a new report from Bloomberg. Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series&#x27; history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

                              <span>When licensed life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley was revealed in June, I cringed while simultaneously letting out a little “ooh” of excitement. See, Animal Crossing and animated Disney movies have both long been big deals in the Wheeler household, and the new game seemed to be riffing heavily on the former. A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.

                              <span>The Force isn’t strong with the remake of classic RPG Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, which has been delayed indefinitely following a badly received demo shown internally at the end of June. Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised. Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more &quot;realistic&quot;.

                              <span>Urbek City Builder looks like a traditional entry to the genre: you place buildings, cars and little people begin to scurry about, and you gradually expand your urban sprawl. The twist is that there&#x27;s no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building&#x27;s resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It&#x27;s out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

                              <span>Zatímco v rámci 64bitového Linuxu už se RETBLEED dávno řeší, o 32bitové variantě jádra to říci nelze a může se klidně stát, že ani nikdy záplatováno nebude. Přišlo se na to jednoduše, neb v Linaro provozují ještě některé 32bitové stroje s Debianem a ty jsou proti RETBLEED o po posledních patchích stále nechráněny.</span>

                              <span>Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you&#x27;re up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy&#x27;s going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games&#x27; chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
&quot;In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I&#x27;m fucked up,&quot; he tells me. &quot;In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.&quot;

                              <span>Meta are increasing the price of all versions of the Meta Quest 2, their flagship wireless VR headset, by $100. They announced the decision in a post on the Oculus blog, saying that the increase in price would help them &quot;continue to invest for the long term and keep driving the VR industry forward.&quot; Basically, Meta would like to lose less money now.

                              <span>The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red&#x27;s fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD&#x27;s limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we&#x27;re starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

                              <span>Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn&#x27;t exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise&#x27;s excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…</span>

                              <span>WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let&#x27;s throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

                              <span>Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Ch. 2.

                              <span>Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg

Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a &quot;holy&quot; site. I&#x27;ll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there&#x27;s not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata&#x27;s best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, &quot;So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.&quot; McDonald also said that it&#x27;s impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…</span>

V USA nyní bude Kongres projednávat nový zákon American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA), který by měl právě tyto fundamentální problémy internetu řešit. Mozilla nyní v rámci otevřené podpory tohoto návrhu zákona zaplatila a zveřejnila otevřený dopis kongresmanům a kongresmankám v deníku The Washington Post, ve kterém je žádá o podporu tohoto zákona.</span>

This is the price for a Zotac Trinity model, but if you prefer Inno3D&#x27;s designs then you can get one of their cards for just £10 more. Either way, you get an impressive level of performance for half the price that some were paying just a few months ago.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 processors are getting ever cheaper, with the mid-range Ryzen 5 5600 today crossing the £130 barrier for the first time. You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

                              <span>Every Monday, Super Auto Pets shakes its big bag of animals and draws a fresh selection for its &#x27;Weekly Pack&#x27; mode. SAP is my favourite auto-battler, and offering a whole new meta every week has me coming back long after I would&#x27;ve stopped playing. I do enjoy the flow across a week as builds rise and fall on an accelerated timescale before everything is wiped clean and starts over on Monday.

Good job that a Naughty Dog artist has said that The Last Of Us Part 1 remake will be launching on our beige box of choice “very soon” after coming to PS5 on September 2nd then. Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

However, 10.10 was started up by Jon Burton, who also founded Traveller’s Tales, the purveyor of Lego games. You can watch the very short announcement teaser trailer below.

My favourites are when modders make the game&#x27;s cat look like their own real cat, and show me photos of that pretty cat. Then... you have some weirder options, like turning it into Garfield (in both realistic and cartoon forms) or a horrifying quadripedal version of GTA: San Andreas star CJ.

HalfGlassGaming’s Josh Wirtanen has proffered a handy guide to how to read the chapter titles, signs and music sheets, with help from the growing Stray community.

BREIN, meanwhile, reports that it has shut down dozens of illicit IPTV vendors and hundreds of sites that offered these services.

                              <span>Christopher Boomer, whose games have been viewed over two billion times, recently obtained a DMCA subpoena compelling Roblox to identify alleged pirates. In its response, Roblox says the subpoena could affect hundreds of thousands of innocent gamers. In an interesting twist, Roblox cites a recent high-profile DMCA case involving Twitter and the right to anonymous speech.

                              <span>Hey, I don&#x27;t want to go to work today. I want to stay home and play all my video games. Luckily, I can do just that. Care to join?
Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I&#x27;ll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix&#x27;s fantastic Neon White on our Twitch channel. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my highest score ever, if you&#x27;re wondering – but I&#x27;m starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal. 
After that, I&#x27;ll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build from last week. We&#x27;re building the Real Grade Wing Gundam, and there&#x27;s still lots to work on. Come watch these little hands cut, sand, and assemble.
Hope to see you there!</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum&#x27;s solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum&#x27;s perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn&#x27;t reveal a new release date, only saying it&#x27;s delaying the game &quot;by a few months.&quot; 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community&#x27;s expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum&#x27;s life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character&#x27;s Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

                              <span>Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive will hold a livestream showcase of upcoming titles on Thursday, July 28. 
A message shared by the publisher&#x27;s Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna&#x27;s last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven&#x27;t been heard from in a good while. There&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;ll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about.

                              <span>A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. &quot;The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak.&quot;
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here&#x27;s hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.</span>

                              <span>Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a &quot;AAA action platformer&quot; for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller&#x27;s Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko&#x27;s stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers&#x27; track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</span>

                              <span>Last year, the demo for Ex-Zodiac offered a sugar rush of Star Fox-inspired checkboard floors, glowing weak spots, and hibber-jibber radio chatter. Now Ex-Zodiac has entered early access, and it looks like it&#x27;s got more going on than straight homage. Fox McCloud never rode a motorbike, for one.

In a lengthy development update, they say the switch should make it easier to patch and maintain the game after release, among other benefits. They also show off some fancy creator tools, and say Hytale won&#x27;t release in 2023.

To compensate, I decided to watch Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns latest trailer while pretending it wasn&#x27;t about Marvel superheroes, but just a Firaxis-made tactics game with character classes who have wildly divergent skillsets. The video focuses on the spider-powered class - and heck, it does look pretty cool.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s entire cinema industry is on the brink of collapse. A few weeks ago, around 16 cinemas were screening pirate copies of the latest movies; last week it was 127. Not even the chairman of the Association of Cinema Owners can muster much optimism. &quot;I can&#x27;t even blame cinemas now dabbling in torrent screenings,&quot; he says. It&#x27;s not a desire to make money, but a fight for survival.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid&#x27;s back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro&#x27;s long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.
Hasbro also announced a Cal Kestis Vintage Collection figure is on the w…</span>

                              <span>Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like &quot;Chester A. Tabby II&quot; (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle,&quot; which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I&#x27;m sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I&#x27;m going to stop now. Share your responses below!</span>

                              <span>The MultiVersus roster expands today with the news that LeBron James, Rick Sanchez, and Morty Smith are stepping into the ring. 


King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.</span>
