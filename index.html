Last year at The Game Awards, Sega dropped one of the most exciting announcements of the show, revealing new games were in development for select classic franchises. In the same announcement, it teased there was even &quot;more&quot; to come.

                              <span>It&#x27;s just &quot;not sure&quot; if it could get it running well on Switch.
A sequel to SMITE has just been announced and if you&#x27;re wondering about the chances of a Nintendo Switch release, it&#x27;s not looking good.
When asked if the MOBA sequel was getting a Switch release by TechRadar Gaming, Titan Forge Games raised concerns about the &quot;power level&quot; of Nintendo&#x27;s current hybrid system and minimal technical specs. Fortunately, the team is still &quot;open&quot; to future platforms if anything is announced by Nintendo (like the rumoured successor system).

Nintendo has been a huge part of Japanese video game culture over the years and with this in mind, it&#x27;s now topped the sales charts for the 19th consecutive year in its homeland.
This information comes from Famitsu&#x27;s 2023 sales report, which also happens to reveal all top 10 video game software sales in 2023 were on the Switch. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom led the charge and was followed by Mario Wonder and Pikmin 4 in second and third place. Here&#x27;s a look (via Nintendo Wire):

Even Dante could not fill this dark soul with light


Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat is, on its surface, a mobile game set in Capcom’s acclaimed Devil May Cry universe. However, to call Peak of Combat a Devil May Cry game is like calling Konami’s Pachinko machines the latest installment in Hideo Kojima’s stealth-action franchise. While it’s tempting to call gacha games like this trash based on the genre alone, Peak of Combat is a special kind of trash.

That may be a weird way to describe it, but I think what I’m trying to say is that it looks reminiscent of Valis. It’s a sort of grainy-looking side-scroller that feels like it was developed for an early Japanese home computer before being ported to the PC-Engine and finally landing on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. A drifting vagabond tied to no home. To clarify, that’s what Valis went through. The difference here is that El Viento was never on a platform aside from the Genesis, and the developer, Wolf Team, wasn’t behind the Valis games. Though, they did handle some of the ports of the first gam…</span>

                              <span>Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Xenoblade 2 were shown off.
On 13th January 2017 in Tokyo, Japan, the Nintendo Switch was fully unveiled to the world via a live stream. Yep, it really has been seven years since we saw the Switch, and we&#x27;re starting to feel very old now.
Geoff Keighley, host of Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards, shared a tweet today reminiscing about the streamed event, which showcased the hybrid console&#x27;s technical details, price, and launch date. It&#x27;s kind of amazing, thinking back, that the Switch was properly shown off just under two months before it launched. That never happens.

One of 2023&#x27;s finest RPGs, Sea of Stars, is showing no signs of staying in the past. We already know to expect some story-based DLC as it was a stretch goal for the game when it was on Kickstarter, but now we know it&#x27;s officially in development.
Developer Sabotage Studio shared a tweet earlier today, updating fans on the current plans for the studio. Back in November 2023, the team got together for &quot;Sabobo Summit&quot;, an event where Sabotage seemingly gets together and shares ideas. And at the most recent one, two things were discussed — Sea of Stars&#x27; DLC, and the vision for &quot;Game 3&quot;.

Pokémon GO auto-catch companion devices are a top-tier way to ensure that you never miss a &#x27;mon while out and about. Since 2016, these devices — which automatically spin PokéStops and catch the critters you pass — have come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with designs to wear on your wrist, clip to your bag, or (in the case of the Poké Ball Plus) carry in a tight grip as if you were Ash Ketchum himself.

                              <span>Two devices are company, three&#x27;s a crowd.
Since the launch of the Pokémon GO Plus back in 2016, the market for auto-catching companion devices has become a pretty crowded one. Whether it&#x27;s on a wrist, clipped to a bag, or stuck straight onto the phone screen, when it comes to finding a bit of kit that will automatically spin PokéStops and catch wild &#x27;mon, you&#x27;re inundated with options.
Until very recently, however, all of these options suffered from the same problem: the dreaded disconnect. For battery-saving purposes, Pokémon GO companion devices would disconnect after an hour, preventing your phone from running out of juice, but running the risk of missing out on valuable catches in the process.

Developer Mobius Games has released a brand new update for Outer Wilds on Switch, marking the game&#x27;s first patch since the highly-anticipated title blasted onto the console last month.
The new update seems to be mainly focused on getting rid of some pesky visual bugs, though there are a handful of gameplay and technical tweaks to be found in this one as well.

Shinorubi feels like a game that came about by providing prompts to an AI specialising in video game building (coming soon, no doubt), feeding it information on various historical works of a particular nature, and then publishing whatever it spat out. That might sound mean to the humans that created it, but it’s an apt descriptor nonetheless.
Shinorubi has the odd misfortune of getting worse depending on the size of your screen. On our 55” panel, the experience was somewhat shocking. Filling the full 16:9 aspect and played in a vertical format, the player ships are enormous, with a giant pink jewel on their nose to dictate the hit-box area. Each pilot has different shot types, underpinned by a straightforward shot, laser, and bomb setup, as well as a fever power-up mode that’s triggered by collecting stars. It appears Shinorubi runs at 30fps, but on a large flatscreen is so janky it&#x27;s hard to say. Every ship in the game, with their various pros and cons, travel at extreme speeds to cover the play area, requiring inappropriate firing of the laser just to quell the weird skating of their movement. The larger the screen, the more prone you are to accidentally crash into bullets, not helped by laggy controls, and everything seems to stutter slightly. When you die in docked mode, it’s not because the game is overly difficult, but because you’re struggling to understand the action.

                              <span>You could say that Alan Wake 2 was decades in the making. Last year’s blockbuster from Remedy saw the studio return to its roots and the horrors therein, dredging up the past to loop into something new, now. But it wasn’t just the main character or gameplay style we saw return, but the sounds and inspirations of the original Alan Wake too, bubbling up from Cauldron Lake through the music of Poe.


When I was playing Alan Wake 2, I was pleasantly surprised—maybe even a bit shocked—to hear a song that sounded like Poe between chapters. And a quick search later, I had verified as much: singer-songwriter Poe had collaborated with Remedy’s Sam Lake to record a new song, “This Road,” just for Alan Wake 2.


For fans of meta-textual works, this was an incredible piece of news. It felt like severa…</span>

                              <span>8BitLegit has announced that Dead Tomb, a new NES game based on an old lost game, is soon to be released for Switch, Xbox, and the actual NES.


While Dead Tomb is a new NES game built from the ground up, it’s actually based on a game called Temporal Inc., which was a game for the Videoway, a very unique subscription-based content delivery system based out of Quebec, Canada. Among its features was the ability to play 8-bit games, which would be loaded into the system’s RAM, which, obviously, emptied once you were done.


Because no one actually owned the games that they were playing, and the service eventually shut down, there are no known copies of Temporal Inc. remaining. However, there was a recorded playthrough of the entire game, so fans were able to reverse-engineer and recreate it, first as a flash game and now as the NES remake, Dead Tomb. If you want more than a quick summation, Hardcore Gaming 101 has a fantastic write-up that covers everything in more detail.




It’s a pretty cool story, and it looks like a pretty cool game. It has you stranded in ancient Egypt, trying to escape from a pyramid. Its verb-based adventure style harkens back to the glory days of the LucasArts SCUMM Engine. It’s been developed by homebrew veterans Collectorvision (which owns the Acclaim brand).


Dead Tomb is coming to Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and NES. It will be available for preorder on all platforms on January 19, 2024. The modern console version will be released on January 26. The NES version is scheduled to ship in Q3 2024 but is limited to 300 copies.

If you’re unfamiliar with Märchen Veil, isn’t that just the best? Not knowing about a game that was just reissued? I actually do know Märchen Veil because of the Famicom Disk System version released in 1987. I don’t own it, but it’s one of the cheapest and most common games on the system, so I always see a copy when I’m looking for new ones to try. I haven’t bought it simply because I was afraid of the language barrier.


I bring that up because I wondered how D4 Enterprise addressed the language barrier since the story is told through cutscenes with Japanese text. The …</span>

                              <span>After targeting iOS and Android devices in November, Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal has a new console on the hit list. The upgraded version of the 2006 stealth classic is coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop on January 25. 


Like the iOS and Android versions, the Switch iteration will see vast improvements over the initial title that launched on PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360 in 2006. Some of which you may notice in the Switch release date trailer below.




Feral Interactive handled the iOS and Android ports of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, and they&#x27;re taking care of the Switch version as well. The game&#x27;s visuals haven&#x27;t changed much since 2006, but there are a lot of quality-of-life features being introduced to make Agent 47 feel a bit more modern. 


Instinct Mode, something that was introduced to the Hitman series later on, is incorporated into Reprisal. It helps players out by highlighting important mission objectives and targets on the level&#x27;s map so you have a clearer idea of what you&#x27;re being tasked with and where you should be headed.


2006&#x27;s Blood Money didn&#x27;t have a mini-map for players to utilize, but Feral Interactive implemented one to aid moment-to-moment gameplay in Reprisal. It&#x27;s dynamic too, showing instant feedback for Agent 47 as NPCs grow suspicious of his actions. 


The controls have been reworked too since the initial PlayStation 2 and Xbox/Xbox 360 releases of Blood Money. This will surely make playing through the stealth title&#x27;s 12 replayable sandbox missions much smoother on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console. 


While the iOS and Android versions of the game launched at $19.99, the Switch iteration of Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal is being listed at $29.99 on the Nintendo eShop. But those who head over there and preorder before the game&#x27;s January 25 release will earn themselves a 16% discount, knocking the overall cost down to $24.99.

SMITE 2 upgrades the third-person MOBA to Unreal Engine 5 while also introducing new content and keeping some features from the original game. Moving forward both versions of SMITEwill continue to function as separate standalone games.




Two Standalone Games


Follow-up tweets confirmed that while Gods from the original will also be in the sequel, some may have some changes. While some Gods will stay true to their existing original SMITE versions, others will receive new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities. The Goddess Hecate will be the first SMITE 2 exclusive God, featuring ranged magical abilities that allow her to reach through dimension…</span>

                              <span>Why not start as you mean to go on, yeah? Discord is probably one of the most popular chat services in the world, but even this monolithic communication tool is not immune to the dreaded &quot;L&quot; word. It turns out it, too, is about to lay a chunk of its workforce off.


According to a report from The Verge, Discord has announced it will be letting 17% of its staff go – the equivalent of 170 people – across numerous departments.

Company CEO Jason Citron has said the layoffs are an effort to help &quot;sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.&quot; It&#x27;s up to you to decide whether that means anything or not.


Quick growth is to blame


The unfortunate impact is allegedly the result of a fast-expanding workforce, &quot;increasing 5x since 2020,&quot; Citron goes on to say. He then adds that, as a result, &quot;we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.&quot;


This comes hot off the heels of Twitch saying it was letting 35% of its staff go and, just before that, Unity also announcing significant job cutbacks. I&#x27;ve said this in a previous post, but this really doesn&#x27;t bode well for the gaming industry for 2024.


Discord has around 196 million monthly users, according to one source, and is often a go-to for gamers. It&#x27;s such a shame that a sizeable portion of the company is being let go, especially after all the grim news about layoffs we saw in 2023.

                              <span>Look, I&#x27;m just going to say it. I haven&#x27;t played Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 yet. I know, I know. The fact that it’s won so many awards should clue me into just how much of a gaming phenomenon it is. However, what I am really into is The Elder Scrolls series, and a recent mod is making my ears prick up.


Over on Nexus Mods, user Ghouls0Rules has made it possible to play Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 as a Dunmer, the dark elf race from such hits as Morrowind and Skyrim. While it has a &quot;heavy focus on visuals,&quot; it goes beyond a simple skin and texture swap.


Image via Ghouls0Rules/Nexus Mods.


It also comes with additional features. The download page says it has &quot;unique passives and spells,&quot; as well as &quot;some level progression for each subrace.&quot; So this is more than just about looking like a TES character, as it has function too. You can get the mod from here. It actually came out in December, but I was too busy with Christmas and not playing BG3 to spot it at the time.


Feels like it fits, thematically


Gaming definitely had its ups and downs across the whole of 2023. While the industry experienced a lot of job losses and studio closures, Larian&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 was definitely a high point.


It&#x27;s currently flying high on the Steam top-sellers list, albeit it&#x27;s now been pushed down one spot by Counter-Strike 2. Given the RPG&#x27;s prestige, it&#x27;s likely to be riding this success wave for some time. The fact that it&#x27;s the ninth most played game in terms of peak concurrent players – according to SteamDB – should tell you everything.


And yet, I still need to get in on it. I don&#x27;t really have any excuse, and as a long-time fan of The Elder Scrolls games, I have even less of one, thanks to this mod.

                              <span>Though the DualSense packs a suite of impressive features, one of the biggest criticisms has been its battery life. This may be remedied by a new version of the controller that has appeared online, as Resetera user ezidro3 noticed. 


The new controller, dubbed the &quot;PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller - White&quot; was originally spotted on Best Buy Canada, along with an included charging station and $89.99CAD price tag, but the post has been taken down since. The new controller looks identical to its predecessor, except this one is supposed to feature 12 hours of gameplay on a full charge. The page has since been taken down, with no official word from Sony yet regarding this new device. 


The DualSense is a phenomenal controller with features that make it a near-irresistable inclusion to any gaming arsenal. However, the low battery has always been a problem, providing 4-6 hours of wireless gameplay depending on which features are being used. Grab the Dualsense Edge, and you can expect even less time.


If there&#x27;s one new piece of hardware Sony wanted to add to please fans, this is probably it. Only a white version has been seen, but if it&#x27;s available in other colors, Sony may have found a way to slip its fingers into my wallet. 


Now where is the DualSense Edge in different colors?

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service on January 17.


Back in the Game Boy Advance days, I was so into Golden Sun. It was released in 2001 – the same year that the Game Boy Advance was launched. I was still getting used to having such a powerful (for the time) handheld, and Golden Sun just felt like a massive production with some really impressive-looking graphics. I remember listening to the theme repeatedly with headphones in, just soaking in the grandeur.


I enjoyed The Lost Age even better, as you can use a password to carry over your progress from the first game. It’s a direct continuation of the narrative, but the whole game is just so much more massive and impressive. Not knowing what I was getting into at the time, I got absolutely sucked in. Much of the game is just a blur to me now, which implies to me that I completed it in a very short period of time.


I never really played the third game on the DS, though.




Since then, I haven’t had the gumption to play through the first game again. The introduction to that game is just so painfully long. It takes quite some time before you’re really let off the leash to do anything of substance. I know it gets better as it proceeds, but I just haven’t been able to get over that initial climb.


Will I finally be able to play through it again now that it&#x27;s on Switch? I’m not sure. I’d like to, but there’s so much precedent for me to give up early on. Maybe I’ll at least try.


Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age will be added to the Game Boy Advance service of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack on January 17.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced that Sand Land, based on the manga by Akira Toriyama, is set to release on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC on April 26.


Alongside the release date announcement, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing the game’s environments and various vehicles. It looks fantastic to me. I know next to nothing about the manga, but I’ve been in love with post-apocalyptic vehicular combat since basically forever. However, it was pushed into overdrive after I discovered the Metal Max series.




Set in a world ravaged by war and environmental disasters, Sand Land stars Beelzebub, the Thief, and Sheriff Rao as they explore the desert. It’s an action RPG with a heavy focus on customizable vehicles. These range everywhere from tanks, to bikes, to mechs. 


I’m not sure how this will shake out, but I’m hoping for something somewhere between Metal Max and Dragon Quest. As far as we’ve seen, things look promising.


Sand Land will release on April 26, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

There&#x27;s no release date for the sequel, but Titan Forge Games says it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Closed early alpha testing will begin this spring. 
The team says Smite 2 will feature a diverse roster of Gods from all sorts of mythological pantheons around the world, and while some playable gods will stay true to how they perform in Smite, others &quot;will have new animations, FX, and even reimagined abilities.&quot;

Discord CEO Jason Citron cites overhiring, which has led to the company becoming &quot;less efficient&quot; in how it operates. The layoffs affected people across various departments. 
The Verge obtained an internal memo from Citron sent to employees announcing the layoffs, which have already happened. That memo explained why the layoffs were happening, when affected employees would receive the email telling them they no longer have a job, and follow-up meetings for those who remain at Discord. 
&quot;We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,&quot; Citron writes in the memo. &quot;As a result, we took on more projects and became le…</span>

                              <span>Sand Land, the video game adaptation of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama’s manga of the same name, has a release date and a new trailer setting up the story.
First announced during Summer Game Fest last year, Sand Land launches on April 26. The game centers on the Fiend Prince Beelzebub, a demon summoned to take down a corrupt King and his Royal Army by the human Sheriff Rao. Joined by Beelzebub’s chaperone, Thief, the three must also find the Legendary Spring, an artifact capable of ending a worldwide drought that has transformed the environment into a desert. 


The open-world action RPG features plenty of vehicle piloting and combat. Players take control of various tanks and dune buggies outfitted with weapons such as machine guns to mow down threats while traversing the sand-covered terrain. Sand Land is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. 
If that’s not enough Sand Land for you, the animated series that premiered in Japan last year is launching worldwide exclusively on Hulu this spring. Sand Land: The Series tells a brand-new story that picks up from the events of the 2023 film. Check out the trailer below:</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need.

                              <span>Golden Sun and its sequel, Golden Sun: The Golden Age are joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week. On January 17, these two classic Game Boy Advance games will be available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet played them before, there&#x27;s probably someone in your life who has. And there&#x27;s a good chance they mention it a lot, for good reason, too. Golden Sun is an excellent RPG and its sequel serves up even more of the story and magic-heavy combat. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with these games, check them out in the trailer below: 


&quot;From the humble village of Vale to the mystical peaks of Mt. Aleph, the Golden Sun game sets magic-wielding young heroes Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia on a quest to prevent the ancient power of Alchemy from being unleashed on their home world of Weyard,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Their adventure takes them through towns, caverns, and dungeons as they face wily enemies, confounding puzzles, and epic challenges that push their magical abilities (Psynergy) to their absolute limits. Along the way, they get help from mysterious creates known as Djinn, who aid the heroes in harnessing their Psynergy to unlock potent spells and unstoppable attacks.&quot; 
In the sequel, The Lost Age, which is a direct follow-up to Golden Sun, the story follows Felix, another young magic-wielder with a unique twist. 
Both games feature co-op gameplay, so you can adventure through Vale with a friend if you&#x27;d like, but both must have access to the games. 

Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age hit the Nintendo Switch Online-Expansion Pack library on Wednesday, January 17. 
If you&#x27;re curious about that library, here&#x27;s every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game available with the subscription.

                              <span>11-year-old game Resident Evil Revelations recently released an update that apparently introduced DRM, only to swiftly roll back the patch after complaints from players that it reportedly caused performance issues. Capcom aren’t giving up that easily on their vow to crack down on mods, though.

                              <span>It’s been almost seven years since Danganronpa V3 brought a close to the trilogy of gloriously twisted murder-mystery visual novels. With several of the series’ biggest names going on to release their next game as an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch, there’s room for a properly good successor on PC. Or why not successors? Last year’s exceptional Paranormasight is definitely in the running, and 2024 is already looking promising thanks to the reveal of Kumitantei: Old-School Slaughter.

The same seems true for Reigns: Three Kingdoms, the latest in the decision-making story series, which arrived on PC (and Switch) yesterday after a year exclusive to Netflix&#x27;s inexplicable library of mobile games. Once again, you will decide the fate of a kingdom (this time, China) by swiping left or right on binary decisions. Unfortunately, you cannot cheatily flick through to interesting parts nor use your finger as a bookmark. Not even if you jam it into a USB port. I did try.

                              <span>Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk is a combination of words that screams &quot;predatory mobile fantasy RPG&quot; but that&#x27;s very much not my takeaway from the game&#x27;s demo. Out tomorrow on Steam for free, this first instalment in the Crystal Story series blends the cuddly feel of a 16-bit Zelda with the dream logic of a Yume Nikki. There&#x27;s a splash of Undertale&#x27;s crackpot experimentalism to the writing and certain battles, as well. 


Those are big comparisons to invoke, and I don&#x27;t expect Crystal Story to measure up to them. But it&#x27;s a lot better than I was expecting from a game whose title had me picturing microtransaction-sodden levelling systems and a pouty elf in a bikini.

                              <span>Readers, I have good news and bad news. Good news. My mum got me an incredible hot chocolate maker for Christmas this year, as well as a jumbo-sized box of grated chocolate sachets to use with it. It is, quite honestly, one of the best presents she&#x27;s ever given me, and it now means I can have perfect hot chocolate, practically on tap, in as little as three minutes. Hotel Chocolat&#x27;s Velvetiser, you&#x27;re an absolute beauty. Honestly, it is so much better than anything I could make, or have made, myself. It&#x27;s fast, easy, wonderfully smooth and properly delicious hot chocolate. Crucially, the machine itself is also dead simple to clean. Gone are the days I have to worry about washing up a pan of semi-encrusted milk afterwards, or faffing about with how many teaspoons of hot chocolate powder to plonk in because I accidentally coughed and sent half of it flying all over the counter.
Bad news. This recent revelation of such effortless, technological ease has instantly kneecapped any excitement or desire I might have had for Kitfox Games&#x27; new tea brewing sim they announced at the tail end of last year, or indeed any other kind of drink-based simulation game (of which there seem to be an increasing number of these days). Whereas before I might have revelled in the step-by-step process of making a perfect hot drink, I have now been fully converted to the ways of instant button pressing and time-saving efficiency. After all, why dwell on the manual minutiae when machinery is king?

                              <span>Kainga Colon Seeds of Civilization is one of many, many games that I didn&#x27;t get on with for some reason or other in early access, and has subsequently sat in my pile long past a 1.0 release, neglected and generating a vague guilt. It&#x27;s come some way since, but its edges are still a little rough, with (usually) minor bugs and limited feedback wrapped up in a design that&#x27;s influenced, of course, by that vague shimmering ghost of Rogue (and thus is innately bad and you&#x27;re all just wrong). So yeah, it kinda has problems.
But I like it. Weird, huh?

In a lengthy discussion of the latter game, the two Yoshidas chew over the familiar topic of where Final Fantasy should go next. According to Naoki Yoshida, it might be time for an injection of new blood.

                              <span>CES 2024 is drawing to a close, and honestly, I’m not especially sad to see it go. While the Las Vegas tech megashow is probably the closest thing PC gaming hardware has to an E3 (and in some ways surpasses it, given CES still exists), this year’s event has been characterised by an all-too-credulous obsession with AI nonsense. Not the fun/useful DLSS kind that makes your games run faster – more the kind that replaces actual creative work with dubiously-sourced robot media. Icky stuff, even by Vegas standards.
Mercifully, not everyone was there to flog Stable Diffusion boxes and imaginary ChatGPT friends, so there is actually some interesting new kit to look forward to in 2024. I’ve rounded up the highlights here, along with some of the more questionable AI-based showings – because they may well merit discussion, even if that discussion amounts to &quot;Is this a good idea?&quot; followed by &quot;No.&quot;

                              <span>In addition to resolutions, new years are always good times to start thinking about the futureeeee, with or without a wibbly oooOOOoooOoooOh intonation. Predictions about what&#x27;s going to happen over the next 12 months abound, some of which are more spurious (and light-hearted) than others. But such near-sightedness is not what we&#x27;re concerning ourselves with today in this latest edition of Ask RPS. We&#x27;re looking much further ahead, thanks to this excellent question from MiniMatt. 
They ask: &quot;Dearest RPS, This being your 150th year in PC gaming [Ed: this question was submitted in 2023], please tell us what the next 150 years hold? Will VR become universal? Will the desktop PC box survive or will we all move over to laptops &amp; steam decks? Will industry continue to consolidate or fragment? Get yer nostradamus on and tell us Peter Molyneux&#x27;s future. 
Indeed, a lot has changed in the world of PC gaming since our esteemed founding in 1873, so come and find out our best guesses for what the future holds below.

                              <span>Bandai Namco have slapped a release date on Ilca Inc&#x27;s Sand Land, which isn&#x27;t a dodgy themepark created by an over-ambitious building supplies firm, but an action RPG adaptation of the same-named manga by Akira Toriyama, in which a titchy demon searches for the Legendary Spring and goes to war with a king who is hogging all the water.
It&#x27;s out 26th April 2024, and alternates beat &#x27;em up action with cartoon tank customisation, in a sort of Dragon Ball X Mad Max homage with chunks of Dragon Quest thrown in for good measure.

                              <span>Core Engage and Daedalic Entertainment have released a new overview trailer for New Cycle, their post-apocalyptic &quot;dieselpunk&quot; city management game. &quot;New Cycle&quot; is obviously a bit of a self-contradiction, and I suspect that&#x27;s deliberate - one of the questions the video leaves you with is whether there is &quot;a future beyond survival&quot;, or whether we are doomed to just repeat the processes of extraction and gradual building-up, resource overexploitation and encroaching disaster suggested by these 12 jam-packed minutes of in-game footage.

                              <span>Choosing the lowest storage capacity Steam Deck or other PC gaming handheld then upgrading to a high-capacity SSD is often cheaper than choosing the highest-tier storage option out of the gate, and can even provide better performance too. 
If that makes sense to you, we spotted a 10% discount on the WD SN740, a solid PCIe 4.0 option that works well in the Steam Deck and even better in the ROG Ally, Legion Go and MSI Claw gaming handhelds that support faster PCIe 4.0 speeds. After the discount at Scan in the UK, the SN740 is available for £81 for 1TB.

                              <span>Lexar&#x27;s Play Micro SD cards are some of the most affordable 1TB memory cards you can buy, and now you can pick up one for just £67.85 - within £3 of the cheapest price ever recorded for this model, which was during Black Friday last year. 
These cards are rated for up to 150MB/s reads and have both UHS Speed Class 3 (3) and App Performance Class 2 (A2) certifications for minimum speeds, making them a decent choice for Steam Deck, ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go owners amongst other use cases in phones, cameras and more.

To celebrate its 14th birthday, developer Terry Cavanagh has dropped an update which makes it Steam Deck verified and professionally translates it into 21 new languages.

                              <span>It took all of one turn before the insults started flying in our Solium Infernum multiplayer preview session this week. Specifically, they&#x27;d been launched straight into the court of League Of Geeks co-founder and studio director Trent Kusters, who was attempting to show us how the game&#x27;s asynchronous multiplayer mode worked in a six-player match-up - the public playtest for which goes live today, Thursday January 11th, over on Steam. Moments earlier, he&#x27;d been walking myself, deputy editor Alice Bee and guides editor Ollie through the basics of this strategy game from hell, telling us about the importance of claiming territory, seeking out places of power to bolster our domain, and how to do battle with our hive-like legion units. But just as we were watching our individual turn orders play out, Kusters announced that Ollie had given him the digital equivalent of a demonic slap in the face, demanding he pay tribute to him, or else…
To his credit, Kusters took it with good humour. &quot;This is the beautiful thing about this game - it&#x27;s petty high school politics in Hell,&quot; he said laughing before graciously deciding to accept the insult at the cost of some of his prestige - the all-important hallmark of how you&#x27;re perceived within this conclave of warring demons fighting for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. Personally, I think Ollie&#x27;s insult would have pierced my exceedingly thin skin instantly if I&#x27;d been in the same position, and I&#x27;d probably have been torn between declaring a vendetta against Ollie&#x27;s unjustified affront, or challenging him to a Praetor duel to exact some (hopefully) righteous vengeance. Alas, since we were literally only a turn into this game, none of us were in any position to make good on those options, leaving the only possible outcome as eating it and moving on. It was a smart move on Ollie&#x27;s part, and one that makes me both terrified and excited to see how our own team multiplayer sessions will play out in the run-up to Solium Infernum&#x27;s full release on February 14th.

The orders were clear: destroy the project and ensure the deletion of all forks. The events of the next 10 days show that by selecting the &#x27;wrong&#x27; target, freshly motivated pirates boost their engagement and content-neutral apps like Tachiyomi reap the benefits.

                              <span>Measures in the UK&#x27;s Criminal Justice Bill currently range from criminalizing the homeless in the event their &quot;rough sleeping&quot; is deemed a nuisance, to outlawing 3D printer firearms templates. Also likely to be approved are provisions to suspend domain names and IP addresses when used for serious criminal purposes. The reframing of copyright infringement as fraud in recent years means that pirate sites may find themselves vulnerable.

                              <span>Atari has announced the next in the line of Retro Games’ mini PC consoles, the Atari 400 Mini, based on the classic Atari home computer. It will be available starting March 28.


For younger readers, before IBM and Microsoft devastated the proprietary home computer market with the introduction of DOS, computers were often their own platform. There was the Commodore line, the Sinclairs, the Apples, and, of course, Atari. The Atari 400 and 800 were first introduced in 1979 and gave birth to the Atari 8-bit line.




Retro Games previously released The C64 Mini, the A500 Mini (Amiga), and The Vic20, based on the Commodore lineup of home computers.


The Atari 400 Mini comes with 25 preinstalled games, including M.U.L.E. and Millipede and the store page says you can load and play programs “you already own.” It comes with a USB controller styled off the Atari CX40, displays at 720p, and is powered by USB (no included adapter). It is also compatible with other USB controllers.


I feel like mini emulation boxes are a good fit for old computers. Unless you’re an enthusiast, you probably have no interest in owning the actual hardware for, say, spreadsheets. Therefore, you don’t really need the keyboard, which was rarely ever used to play games. As for me, I own an Atari 600XL and an Atari XEGS, so I’m probably passing on this. On the other hand, games for them are kind of hard to come by and often expensive.


Currently, the Atari 400 Mini is only announced in the UK where it releases on March 28. No plans have been announced for North America.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the new year, and there&#x27;s a bevy of new games on the way. One of them, Unicorn Overlord, sees Vanillaware tackling fantasy tactics. And the little slice of music that&#x27;s been shared, in 16-bit form, certainly sets the tone.


Atlus has shared a roughly four-minute preview of selections from the 16-bit arranged music album for the upcoming Unicorn Overlord. Per the description, this album takes the music of Unicorn Overlord and rearranges it into 16-bit form for the game&#x27;s Monarch Edition (a.k.a. collector&#x27;s edition).


Who better, then, to remix some tactics nostalgia than Basiscape? The studio worked with Vanillaware on 2020&#x27;s excellent 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, and it&#x27;s founded by Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen composer Hitoshi Sakimoto. A very fitting…</span>

                              <span>Limited Run Games has announced another couple of classic collections, but unlike the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection, these are actually good. Coming up is Felix the Cat and Rocket Knight Adventures: Resparked.


I’m just learning this now, but Felix the Cat is turning 105 this year. The character got his start in the golden age of animation back in 1919, starring in some silent shorts. Like most popular characters from the time period, he kept coming back repeatedly for new TV series and movies, even if he wasn’t as high profile as Looney Tunes (Merry Melodies) and Mickey Mouse. Limited Run Games’ collection contains the 1992 NES title by Hudson Soft, and the 1993 Game Boy port.


The NES title is actually somewhat based on the godawful 1989 movie, which, in turn, is based on the …</span>

This informal moniker has become one of the biggest question marks dangling over 2024.


Days into the new year, and even before the calendar flipped over, headlines with rumors, speculation, and discussion popped up everywhere. Where is the Nintendo Switch 2? What is it? When could it arrive?


It&#x27;s really hard not to feel like we&#x27;ve been here before. I, myself, have done my fair share of reporting on and speculating about a new Switch. Before it was Switch 2, it was a Switch Pro. We&#x27;re closing in on seven years of the Nintendo Switch, and fans are wondering where its successor is.

The news, tweeted by Max and Naughty Dog, is the third casting for the new season in the past few days. The first was Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, and soon after, Beef&#x27;s Young Mazino as Jesse.




Creators Neil Druckmann and showrunner/director Craig Mazin talked about Merced and Dina with Variety, saying &quot;Dina is warm, brilliant, wild, funny, moral, dangerous, and instantly lovable. You can search forever for an actor who effortlessly embodies all of those things, or you can find Isabela Merced right away. We couldn’t be prouder to have her join our family.&quot;

                              <span>Upcoming action RPG Granblue Fantasy: Relink will get a demo for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. According to Gematsu, publisher Cygames and developer Cygames Osaka announced that a demo will be coming to both platforms tomorrow, January 12. In areas where it is already January 12, like New Zealand, the demo is available now.

3 Modes and a launch version reward


The demo will feature three different modes: Tutorial, Story, and Quest modes. In tutorial mode, players will be able to practice the basic controls of the game to get comfortable with Granblue Fantasy: Relink&#x27;s ARPG combat system. Story mode will feature a brief section from the introduction part of Relink, showcasing a bit of the story. Last is Quest Mode, which includes three different quests. The quests are multiplayer-compatible allowing players to team up with 1-3 friends or AI-controlled allies in more challenging battles.


Alongside the three modes, the demo will also feature the ability to customize gear load-outs across 11 different playable characters.


Those who complete the Story and Quest modes of the demo will get some small bonuses in the release version at launch. It&#x27;s always great when a demo adds some sort of bonus for playing it or even a save that carries over. It makes me much more interested in giving it a whirl when I know there&#x27;s something to gain from doing so or that I won&#x27;t have to do everything again.


Granblue Fantasy: Relink launches on January 31, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

                              <span>Sitting down to write this review, I could barely believe Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is the first new entry in the Prince of Persia franchise in 13 years. After both considering my time with this game and the rich history the series has enjoyed until now, I had to remind myself why that is.


Jordan Mechner&#x27;s original Prince of Persia pioneered the cinematic platformer genre back in 1989, and Ubisoft&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a critical darling back in 2003. There&#x27;s so much potential to draw from between those entries, yet regardless, the series floundered. The last entry in the series, The Forgotten Sands, didn&#x27;t exactly light the world on fire. And while the Sands of Time movie was well received at the time (except by Destructoid), it didn&#x27;t seem to have any cultura…</span>

Earlier in December, Halo season 2 got a small teaser, which uses some of the shots in the trailer. Alongside the reveal was its release date, February 8th, and a YouTube release of the first season. 


According to the YouTube description, in Halo season 2, &quot;Master Chief John-117 leads his team of elite Spartans against the alien threat known as the Covenant. As humanity’s best hope for winning the war, John-117 discovers his deep connection to a mysterious alien structure that holds the key to humankind’s salvation, or its destruction — the Halo.&quot;

                              <span>It&#x27;s a shame Arkane Studios&#x27; Ravenholm was cancelled. That would have definitely filled the large Half-Life hole us fans have felt for some time. However, a modding team has been on the case with a custom story that lets us experience the creepy mining town some more.


From the people that brought us the Raising the Bar project – an overhaul of Half-Life 2 that breathes new life into the iconic FPS – comes Raising the Bar: Salvation. In this mod, we fill the shoes of Father Grigori, the pastor of Ravenholm who watches over Gordon Freeman in the official game, as he continues his story.




We get to trek back through the abandoned location, in which the devout man intends to burn the entire place down. You can download the mod here. The above video says you&#x27;ll also need to install the Division 2.1 file from the Raising the Bar: Redux mod in order for Salvation to work.


The holiest shotgun-wielder around


What makes this slightly intriguing is its approach to combat. The team has said that resources are a bit more scarce, and players will only have a limited amount of supplies. With just a shotgun, custom mines, and a Duke Nukem-style kick, it becomes more about picking one&#x27;s battles.


Father Grigori was definitely one of the most interesting characters in Half-Life 2. While only in the one section of the game, and not always visible on-screen, his presence is often felt by the player, as gunfire and manic laughs are heard in the distance.


He&#x27;s part of what makes the Ravenholm chapter such a standout. While we may never know what happens to Gordon Freeman in any future Half-Life installments, Salvation at least fills in some of the side narrative. And isn&#x27;t that just as important?

                              <span>Do you miss the days of physical magazines packed with demo discs? Would you like to see it perverted in sinister ways? PC Cursed 98 will give you the whole experience you’ve been looking for, it&#x27;s free, and it’s available for PC now.


PC Cursed 98 is a compilation of short indie games in the framework of the sort of demo disc that came with magazines in the &#x27;90s and &#x27;00s. This makes it adjacent to Haunted PS1 and its variety of PS1-styled cursed demo discs. What makes PC Cursed 98 a bit different is that it comes packed with an actual magazine. I’m not even talking about a short pamphlet, either. It’s 52 pages of articles and twisted advertisements. That’s commitment. It’s even set up in such a way that you can have it professionally printed out. On top of that, there are even covers for a CD case for the demo disc.




The (free) demo disc contains 21-ish shortform horror games from a slew of creators. From the list, I only really recognize Jacob Jazz, who made the Baobabs Mausoleum games. But that’s kind of the point of these compilations: you get a glimpse into the minds of a variety of small, indie developers. Maybe you’ll like what you see and will form a brand-new parasocial relationship with them!


The games are supposedly all horror-themed, but their style runs the gamut between lo-fi, jank pop, and retro-inspired. Typically, for these jams, a lot of the included games are very experimental. As such, some of them fail. Others might make you wish you could unsee them. But a few may echo in the darkest recesses of your soul. It’s worth a look. Jam games, I guess you could call them.


PC Cursed 98 is now available for PC through itch.io. It’s free, so it probably doesn’t hurt.

                              <span>While Nvidia and AMD duke it out to be supreme GPU champion in the PC gaming world, Intel is also here. Just smiling and waving. The chip firm entered the GPU arena back in 2022, and now it&#x27;s a little closer to completing the next iteration of its Arc brand.


In an interview with PC World (as spotted by PC Gamer) at CES 2024, Intel Fellow Tom Petersen said that Arc Battlemage (the follow-up to Alchemist) &quot;is coming.&quot; Around 30% of engineers are working on the GPU right now, &quot;mostly on the software side.&quot; Ideally, this all wraps up before CES in January 2025.




On top of this, the hardware portion of the team is now moving onto Celestial, the next graphics card from Intel. Petersen says Battlemage has &quot;already had its first silicon in the lab,&quot; and &quot;more good news is coming.&quot;


A story arc that perhaps needs to pick up


As for when we can expect the next line of Arc GPUs, Petersen is unable – or unwilling – to go into details, but is hopeful we may get to see something at next year&#x27;s CES event. That&#x27;s not a given, but it might give some indication of perhaps when it could be released. That&#x27;s all just pure speculation, for now.


Intel doesn&#x27;t seem to have quite found its feet in the dedicated graphics card industry. With Nvidia and AMD flexing every muscle they have, Team Blue seems to be trailing behind. This could be because the Alchemist experienced delays, but it could be because the other two have just been in the game for much longer.


However, the upcoming Claw device from MSI is being powered by Intel hardware, including an Arch chip, so that&#x27;s something. This time next year, things might be different, but it sounds like progress on Battlemage is coming along.

                              <span>It should come as no surprise to anyone that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s Season 1 Reloaded update is introducing a few potentially interesting new weapons, of course. The weird bit, though, is that there&#x27;s an unmentioned third weapon being shown off, too.


The weapon in question is relatively easy to spot in the official announcement&#x27;s featured image; in fact, though it&#x27;s easy to overlook it when it&#x27;s being held by a character clad in neon purple. Specifically, it&#x27;s FN Herstal&#x27;s classic bullpup assault rifle: the F2000. This wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be worth mentioning, had F2000 been referenced in the body of the text at all. Instead, the two newly confirmed weapons coming as part of January 17&#x27;s Season 1 Reloaded patch are the HRM-9 SMG and the TAQ Evolvere LMG (Beretta PMX and FN Evol…</span>

                              <span>Having sold millions of copies of the Phantom Liberty DLC since it was released in September, Cyberpunk 2077 is on a roll. Well, not quite, as developer CD Projekt Red is now turning its attention to the follow-up, with the game&#x27;s narrative director eager to get started.


According to a recent Twitter post from CDPR&#x27;s own Igor Sarzyński, Cyberpunk 2077 was &quot;just a warm-up,&quot; and the studio is now preparing to &quot;officially kick-start our Orion journey.&quot; Orion is the working title for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.




The team working on the next entry began its first day in the new Boston office earlier this week. Sarzyński has said they&#x27;re &quot;excited for this project,&quot; while one person (who weirdly dubs themselves Abraham Lincoln on Twitter) asks whether they&#x27;ve been practicing their Boston access. Sarzyński replies: &quot;I&#x27;m trying!&quot;


Imagine Cyberpunk and Good Will Hunting in one


Towards the end of last year, CD Projekt Red unleashed one last big update for Cyberpunk 2077. For real, this time. The developer is now seemingly leaping into 2024 with hopes for the future.


We don&#x27;t really know anything about the upcoming game, but it&#x27;s fair to say the studio will have learned some much-needed lessons from when the current game dropped like a hot mess back at the tail end of 2020.


Things have certainly improved since then – to the point where it was one of the top-grossing Steam releases of 2023 – but it&#x27;s a memory that burns deep for some. As CDPR begins to make progress on the follow-up, we can only hope Sarzyński and the rest of the team knock this one out of the park the first time around.

Categories that Insomniac&#x27;s superhero game is in include Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Animation, and Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, to name a few. Alan Wake 2 trails not too far behind with eight nominations.


Remedy&#x27;s survival horror has managed to catch the eyes of critics thanks to its metastory, use of music, and phenomenal ensemble of characters. It has been nominated for Game of the Year as well, but it also picks up nominations in the Outstanding Achievement in Story category and Outstanding Achievement in Character category which gives Saga Anderson a nod.

We know everyone is desperate for news on Nintendo&#x27;s next hardware, but an audio company that&#x27;s creating the AI-enhanced successor to GameShark (yes, really) company claiming to be releasing a product alongside the Switch 2&#x27;s launch was not on our bingo cards this morning.
As noted in a press release sent out earlier today, and spotted by DigitalTrends, audio electronics company Altec Lansing boldly claimed that it would be officially launching Ai Shark, which is purported to be an AI-based version of those old cheat cartridges we all had back in the day, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2&#x27;s launch in September 2024. The product was announced at CES 2024.

We have just one week to go before the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown brings the sword-swinging series back to Switch on 18th January. While a free demo is available today for you to check out what&#x27;s in store, the Digital Foundry tech experts are also on hand to give us the lowdown on the performance side of things.
Now, Ubisoft released frame rate and resolution details for the game last week, so the question was really going to be whether the finished project actually lived up to the promise. According to DF, it does.

                              <span>The original Fresh Prince returns.
Way back in 1989, Jordan Mechner&#x27;s original Prince of Persia represented one of the first and best examples of what&#x27;s become known as the &#x27;cinematic platformer&#x27;. It&#x27;s a traditionally challenging genre, one that combines strong art, fun storylines, and fluidly animated protagonists to bring us adventures that test reflexes and puzzling abilities to their limits. You know the sort of thing, stuff like Flashback and Another World; y&#x27;know, the classics.
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is the latest rebirth of sorts for the franchise — following on from The Sands of Time and 2008&#x27;s Prince of Persia revamp — one that takes the established lore of past entries and ditches them in favour of a tangentially-related new lead character, and a bit of role-switching fun. Yes, this brand-new tale sees you play as Sargon, a member of The Immortals (crime-fighting hero types), and a man who meets all the criteria required of a bonafide action hero.

Following its initial announcment in 2023, Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal has been confirmed to launch on Nintendo Switch later this month on January 25th, 2024.
The revamped re-release came to mobile platforms in November 2023 and boasted new features such as a mini-map and tailored touchscreen controls. The biggest addition came with Instinct Mode, an ability featured in later entries that would allow the player to seamlessly highlight targets, enemies, and points of interest. New features present in the Switch release can be toggled off if you want to experience Blood Money in its original form.

Oh gosh, talk around the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; is really starting to gain momentum now. It&#x27;s only natural that so-called leaks and whispers will increase rapidly as we inch to an inevitable official announcement from Nintendo, whenever that will be. It can be tough to determine what&#x27;s legitimate and what&#x27;s not, and for every story we run here on NL concerning credible hardware rumours, there are five others we sidestep due to chronic eye-roll and big hmm.
A recent report from a Taiwanese Economic Forum (via Reddit) has suggested that the Switch 2 will come boasting a 120hz screen, NVIDIA’s T239 processor, and improved battery life. On the flip side, it also states that the console&#x27;s RAM will be limited to 8GB, while the internal storage will only be a meagre 64GB.

Netflix is cranking out new seasons of Sonic Prime seemingly faster than the &#x27;Blue Blur&#x27; himself, with Season 3 now available to watch in its entirety.
It doesn&#x27;t seem that long that we were first reporting on the animated show and speculating what it would all be about, but now the story is kicking into high gear with Sonic going head-to-head against an alternate reality version of Tails called &#x27;Nine&#x27;. In fact, he even brings on some unlikely alliances in this new series to ensure the protection of the &#x27;Shatterverse&#x27;.

                              <span>There are few things the internet is hungrier for than news about the Switch successor. With relative silence from Nintendo, folks have been left to grasp at straws and theorize what it will look like, how it will be played, and when it will be released. Today, thanks to Digital Trends, we might have an answer to that last question, and it came from a rather odd place.
Back in the day, GameShark was known for making cheat code cartridges in video games. You could plug it into your system, download cheat codes, and use them to become the master of games on your N64, PlayStation, or Game Boy. However, in recent years, the company has decided to take a turn in the direction of the company. Renamed &quot;AI Shark,&quot; it&#x27;s now a software-agnostic program designed to provide &quot;personalized hints and assistance that keep up with fast-paced, competitive gaming.&quot; What does any of this have to do with the Switch 2? It&#x27;s all in one sentence at the end of the first paragraph of their press release. 
&quot;The official launch is planned to coincide with the Nintendo Switch 2 in September 2024.&quot;
To be clear, Nintendo has offered no official confirmation that this is an accurate launch window, and there are myriad reasons to doubt the validity of the claim. Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier reports that AI Shark is simply guessing at the Switch console&#x27;s release date. Regardless, it is an odd statement to make in an official press release, and it will be very interesting to see Nintendo&#x27;s response, assuming it issues one.

Shannon Woodward, the actress who originally portrayed Dina in The Last of Us Part 2, has responded to the live-action casting of Isabela Merced. In addition to a tweet of general support for Merced, Woodward responded to a fan who wondered why she didn&#x27;t reprise her role in the sequel. In short, it&#x27;s because of her age.

&quot;Bcs [sic] I am... Much older lol,&quot; Woodward&#x27;s second tweet reads. Much like Ellie&#x27;s original actress, Ashley Johnson, Woodward is about 20 years older than the character she portrays. Dina&#x27;s character model is actually based on an entirely different person, Cascina Caradonna, who fits the age range of the character.

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a triumphant and impressive return for Ubisoft&#x27;s thought-dead platforming franchise. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review by following the link, but that review pertains to the console version of the game and does not address a question many players have: how is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown on Switch? The short answer is that it is solid. Playing on Switch does not feel like a major downgrade from the other versions. For the long answer, check out the video below!

The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to pu…</span>

                              <span>Paramount+ released the first season of its live-action Halo series back in 2022 and while the initial premiere showed promise, the show was ultimately a letdown, both as the Chief&#x27;s first foray into the live-action television space and as a Halo story. Now, the subscription streaming service has released the official trailer for Season 2 of Halo: The Series and it promises the fall of Reach, plenty of Covenant and Energy Swords, and more of Master Chief without his helmet on for some reason. 
I&#x27;m not completely sold on returning to this series – I didn&#x27;t even finish the first season – but I&#x27;d be lying if I said this trailer didn&#x27;t pique my interest. Perhaps I&#x27;m a sucker for the staples of Halo and the story of Reach, or maybe I have a terrible memory; perhaps it&#x27;s a combination of both. 
Check out the Season 2 trailer for Halo: The Series for yourself below: 


Paramount+ renewed Halo: The Series for a second season early in the show&#x27;s first season, so it&#x27;s clear the streamer is committed to this property for now. Here&#x27;s hoping the second season fairs better than the first. 
For more, read about Halo: The Series&#x27; showrunner&#x27;s decision to show Master Chief&#x27;s face in the show, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Halo Infinite review. After that, check out this story about how Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries will develop Halo games &quot;now and in the future&quot; even after layoffs that happened at the studio last year.

                              <span>TeamKill Media, the developer behind last year&#x27;s Quantum Error, has revealed Son and Bone, its PlayStation 5-exclusive first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. It&#x27;s due out some time this year and you can watch the announcement teaser below. 
&quot;When a local farm in Patchwork, MT is attacked by a group of notorious bandits, Sheriff Sam Judge sets out to bring them to justice by any means necessary and save the hostage they have taken,&quot; the teaser&#x27;s YouTube description reads. &quot;But on his journey, through the mysterious motives of those he pursues, Sam finds himself transported to another world overrun with prehistoric creatures and dinosaurs and must fight for his life to make it back to earth.&quot; 
Check out the Son and Bone announcement teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, TeamKill Media is aiming to fill the Dino Crisis-sized hole left in action games right now, and we&#x27;re here for it.
Here are some official screenshots from the game: 

Son and Bone is due out this year exclusively on PS5.

                              <span>The 27th D.I.C.E. Awards return next month to Las Vegas, where the industry-only event celebrates the best games and achievements in games of 2023. Unlike The Game Awards, which are hosted and produced by Geoff Keighley, with votes from media outlets and the public in some instances, the D.I.C.E Awards are voted on exclusively by game developers. 
Basically, it&#x27;s the awards show where the people who made the games you played last year determine their favorite games of last year. It&#x27;s an awards show of The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, with D.I.C.E standing for Design, Innovate, Communicate, and Entertain, and amongst the awards, the academy typically inducts someone into the Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame – we spoke to Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon about it in 2022.

                              <span>A retailer listing of a &quot;V2 DualSense&quot; controller for the PlayStation 5 has been spotted online, and it boasts an &quot;exceptional&quot; 12-hour battery life. That&#x27;s a much longer battery life than the standard version of the DualSense controller, which averages between 6 to 10 hours (and many players would argue less). 
More specifically, players spotted a Best Buy Canada retail listing for a &quot;PlayStation 5 V2 DualSense Wireless Controller – White,&quot; as reported by Eurogamer. Curiously, this V2 DualSense controller looks identical to the white ones that launched with the PS5. But in the &quot;About This Product&quot; section of the controller, you&#x27;ll find, &quot;Exceptional 12-hour battery life, on a full charge, supports long gaming sessions.&quot; This section also states the controller includes a DualSense charging station that &quot;offers easy click-in charging.&quot; 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about this controller and whether or not it&#x27;s real, and will update this story if it learns more. 
If you&#x27;re interested in a controller upgrade you can make right now, check out the PS5 DualSense Edge. And if you&#x27;ve ever wondered what it might be like to have a DualSense controller cut in half with a screen placed between the two halves, check out the PlayStation Portal.

                              <span>A new Elden Ring update has patched the game&#x27;s Easy Anti-Cheat to support a recent SteamOS update, as detailed on publisher Bandai Namco&#x27;s official site. It&#x27;s good news for people playing the FromSoftware RPG on Steam Decks, especially those haunted by memories of the game&#x27;s technical tribulations at launch, some of which were caused by the anti-cheat functionality. It&#x27;s less great news for the millions hankering for the slightest whisper of new information about Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. But save your pity, above all, for the dozens of videogame news writers - dozens, I tell you! - who must write about Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC at any opportunity, lest the demigods of traffic eat our souls.

Cooking adventure Venba leads the pack with a total of four nominations, but it&#x27;s closely followed by Cocoon, A Highland Song, Mediterranea Inferno and 1000xResist, all of which have scooped three noms apiece.

                              <span>As Prince Of Persia subtitles go, The Lost Crown is certainly an evocative one. It conjures up images of forgotten pasts being rediscovered, of wrongs being righted, and power being restored to its rightful balance. They&#x27;re all promises that Ubisoft Montpellier capably deliver on over the course of its neatly plotted story, and often in more ways than one. But after flinging its hero warrior Sargon around the monster-filled streets of its Mount Qaf citadel for the better part of 20 hours, I&#x27;d also like to proffer the following alternatives: Pit Of A Thousand Spikes; The Eternal Death Wheels Of Spinning Blades; or maybe just simply Traps: The Game. These are perhaps more accurate descriptions of the challenges you&#x27;ll face in The Lost Crown, as Mount Qaf is not a place you&#x27;re allowed to tread lightly. Death stalks every corner, but that&#x27;s precisely what makes this dextrously designed Metroid-like such a thrilling platformer. Put away your prejudices, because this is easily the equal of both Moon Studios&#x27; pair of Ori games, Hollow Knight and its Metroid genre namesakes.

We chat about our most anticipated video games that may or may not be arriving this year, including some racing, some spac(marine)ing and some book selling. Also some freezing and some despairing (at BioWare and Bloodlines 2, potentially). Plus: Nate and James have an anecdote off, which makes me lose my mind and become a horrible person for about four solid minutes. I have apologised, and me and James are still friends.

                              <span>I reached the Elden Ring exhaustion point a couple of years ago… and I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve climbed out of my slump. Yes, I gave the game a Bestest Best badge that I stand by, but I also think it&#x27;s one of FromSoftware&#x27;s most taxing soulslike creations. It&#x27;s so colossal that, by the end of my adventure, I&#x27;d had enough of the umpteenth boss. I wanted rid.
With talk of Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC spinning up as 2024 begins, I&#x27;ve assessed my feelings and come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m not as excited as I would&#x27;ve been had the game and its DLC somehow existed a few years ago. To be honest with you, part of me hopes it just ends up being a roguelike. That way I might actually get into it.

                              <span>It’s time for another pull on the velvet rope labelled “too many games”. In fairness, this time the argument is a touch more involved than perennial moaning about backlogs – to whit, “there are too many games and it’s all the pandemic’s fault”. Nacon’s head of publishing Benoit Clerc has argued that the Covid lockdown years have bred too much investment in new games, and that we’re currently reaping the results in the form of an unsustainable glut of releases.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve written about this somewhere already - I may have expressed it to a therapist - but when I was a lad, I had a recurring nightmare about a place called Snake World. It was a fizzing neon labyrinth that was both home to various evil snakes and sort of made of snakes in probably-Freudian ways.
Fortunately, I had a lucid dreaming strategy for escaping from Snake World: relax all my limbs as much as I could, then flail around violently to wake myself up.

                              <span>Před jedenácti lety, ve svých šestadvaceti letech, navždy odešel Aaron Swartz, výjimečný americký hacker (programátor), spisovatel, archivář, politický organizátor a internetový aktivista. Aaron Swartz založil Demand Progress, spolupracoval na projektech Open Library, Internet Archive a Reddit. Ve svých čtrnácti se podílel na specifikaci RSS 1.0. Vytvořil webový framework web.py, pracoval na tor2web a rozšíření HTTPS Everywhere pro Chrome. Stál u zrodu licence Creative Commons. Aaronovi Swartzovi hrozilo 35 let vězení a pokuta milion dolarů za hromadné stahování vědeckých článků z webu JSTOR. Dle přátel i vlastních výpovědí několik posledních let trpěl depresemi. V pátek 11. ledna 2013 ukončil svůj život oběšením.</span>

                              <span>Sony has made some pretty big reveals at tech showcase CES this year—a mixed-reality headset, a first look at the Gravity Rush movie, and a car that you can control with a DualSense—so it makes the desultory offerings of new PS5 Slim colorways all the more disappointing.

                              <span>Shmup fans are gonna be eating good this year, because Red Art Games kicked off its first Shmup Week event with two announcements. Both Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 and Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns Complete Collection are set to launch on Switch sometime in Q3 2024.


Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 includes Void Gore, Project Starship, and Z-WARP, all of which are on screen-filling display in the announcement trailer below.




In addition to the standard physical release, the first Bullet Hell Collection will be available in a Deluxe Edition that packs the games with one of three keychains, a poster, and reversible cover art. 




True to its title, Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns Complete Collection includes both Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns games by developer Rake in Grass (Rampage Knights, Silent Sector). Those who opt for all the bonuses will get the game along with a keychain, reversible cover, and a CD containing Machinae Supremacy&#x27;s original soundtrack. Like the standard versions, the Deluxe Editions of both games are priced at €39.99, but these are exclusively up for pre-order at the Red Art Games website. 


Here&#x27;s a look at both games in action:




Beyond that, it sounds like Shmup Week has some more surprises waiting in the wings. Red Art Games teased an announcement &quot;coming straight from Japan&quot; for Thursday, January 11 at 5:00 p.m. CET. There&#x27;s also the previously-delayed Shinorubi, which finally locked in a January 12 launch date from Red Art Games last month. That&#x27;s right around the corner digitally with a physical Switch release to follow at a later date.

Sony is highlighting Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands as a stand-out this month. It&#x27;s a spin-off from Gearbox&#x27;s renowned Borderlands series. This time around, the looter-shooter leans into the tabletop inspirations set forth by past content like Borderlands 2&#x27;s Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep. Chris Carter reviewed it at launch in March of 2022 and considered it &quot;great&quot;. 




Resident Evil 2 (also coming to Game Pass) is the second headliner this month. Capcom&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; remake of the iconic horror sequel wow-ed when it was released in 2019. I&#x27;d strongly recommend it if you&#x27;ve yet …</span>

                              <span>Remember Suika Game? The charming puzzler blew up late last year thanks to its engrossing fruit-merging gameplay and colourful theme (and the help of a load of vtubers to boot). While the original was only on Nintendo Switch - although technically even that was a port of a game included on a projector, of all things - plenty of Suika clones quickly emerged to fill its watermelon-shaped hole on PC.

While the union claim that their agreement with Replica will allow for a “fair” and “ethical” approach to creating AI voices, it’s clear that a number of actors with credits in games from Baldur’s Gate 3, Mortal Kombat and Starfield to Apex Legends, World of Warcraft and Genshin Impact don’t agree.

It&#x27;s £100 off today, making the price of admission to the really big monitor show just £699. For about twice the price of a good 1440p 165Hz monitor, you get a monitor the size of two 1440p 165Hz monitors - but, critically, with no gap in the middle.

                              <span>Amazon-owned Twitch have announced that they will lay off &quot;just over 500&quot; people - almost 35% of their workforce - in the course of on-going plans to &quot;rightsize our company&quot;, with CEO Dan Clancy conceding that the streaming service has been operating based on &quot;where we optimistically expect our business to be in 3 or more years, not where we&#x27;re at today.&quot;

                              <span>Earlier this week, I shared a Tweet, or X post or whatever, that was a Twitter Film Guy being like, &quot;It&#x27;s a burden talking to people about my passion, movies, because I think about them on a fundamentally different level&quot;. Like, okay, Scorsese, you can say you didn&#x27;t really like Murder Mystery 2, the normies won&#x27;t chase you out of town with pitchforks. You know what actually is a burden? Your passions being watching hours of anti-multi-level marketing (MLM) YouTube videos, which is the content hole I fell down over the Christmas break. Your weird uncles have at least seen a film before, but it&#x27;s not like I can turn to my mum and ask her if she thinks the weird Monat Christians are worse than the Seint make-up TikTok girlies without explaining almost every word in the sentence.
Anyway. My point is: someone should make an MLM simulation game.

                              <span>In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. 


Warp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that Viscera Cleanup Detail&#x27;s Sniffer tool is better than a fresh new MMO server. This was a close win, 54% vs 46%, but know we now how we&#x27;re entering the new year: equipped to track down the sources of our problems, rather than running away from them. With that resolved, it&#x27;s time to get snarky. A real snark-off. So much snark, and so many snarks, and so much potential to be undone by the hubris of miscalculating snark. What&#x27;s better: Half-Life&#x27;s Snarks or Planescape: Torment&#x27;s Litany Of Curses?

The game&#x27;s user reviews are Mostly Negative, three months after release, with complaints covering a wide gamut: the online being full of cheaters, the single player being boring, and the game being poorly optimised for PC.

                              <span>Little-known indie platform holder Valve have announced a new policy for Steam releases that make use of &quot;AI&quot; technology. To boil it down, developers will now have to disclose how they&#x27;re using AI tools on Steam pages, including what &quot;guardrails&quot; they&#x27;re putting in place for live-generated stuff that might be illegal or infringe on copyright. Valve are also introducing a new player reporting system for breaches. The company say these adjustments &quot;will enable us to release the vast majority of games that use AI&quot;, with the exception of Adult Only Sexual content that is generated live.

Players of the action-RPG/management hybrid on social media quickly did what people on social media do: demanded that they add sex. 

Its developers said they would and now we get to see what that means when the update launches on January 16th.

                              <span>Google uses several technical interventions to prevent notorious pirate sites from rising to the top of its search results. While these actions have an effect, they couldn&#x27;t prevent a resurgence in DMCA takedown notices over the past year. The search engine is now processing an average of 1.6 billion removal requests per year, mostly driven by publishers.

                              <span>Police in Vietnam say they have arrested three people behind at least three websites that offered pirated movies and anime content for online streaming. It&#x27;s claimed that the alleged 30-year-old ringleader launched the operation in 2019 and was assisted by people he recruited online. Action of this type is rare in Vietnam and may offer Hollywood a glimmer of hope that a wider crackdown sits somewhere on the horizon.

                              <span>Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us&#x27; second season. This follows yesterday&#x27;s news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show&#x27;s second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix&#x27;s Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for &quot;Snooze&quot; by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity&#x27;s Triump, and Good Boy. 
We&#x27;re so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can&#x27;t wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren&#x27;t alone either – The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark&#x27;s upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It&#x27;s a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark&#x27;s chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

The company announced these layoffs in an internal memo sent out on Monday, January 8. These job cuts follow a turbulent 2023 for the company after it attempted to introduce per-install fees to developers using its game engine before later walking it back. 
Unity is expected to lay off 1800 people by the end of March and once complete, it will be the company&#x27;s largest round of layoffs ever. It will be its fourth round of layoffs since July 2022, as noted by Yahoo! Finance. The job cuts are expected to affect all departments at Unity.

                              <span>Last year was one of the best years for game releases but easily one of the worst for the people who made them, with more than 10,000 workers laid off by various companies, including Microsoft, Epic Games, BioWare, Bungie, Naughty Dog, and many more. Unfortunately, it seems this heartbreaking trend is continuing into this new year as yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Amazon-owned streaming company Twitch is set to lay off 500 employees, or about 35 percent of its staff.

Reasons why included a desire for better wages, increased safety precautions, and protections around exploitative uses of artificial intelligence. Now, just a few months later, SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with Replica Studios, an A.I. voice technology company, to allow game developers to use A.I. voices, as reported by Game Developer. 
Various video game voice actors, like Yong Yea, the new English voice of Kazuma Kiryu in the Like a Dragon series, have publicly stated that they and other actors they know were not aware of this. &quot;Every voice actor I know not only didn&#x27;t approve this,&quot; Yea writes in a tweet. &quot;[They] pretty much heard about this for the first time today on Twitter.&quot;

                              <span>Projekt OpenWrt letos oslaví dvacáté výročí existence a John Crispin při té příležitosti oživil starou myšlenku na tvorbu prvního vlastního hardwarového návrhu plně podporovaného upstreamem. Mělo by jít o router postavený na populární platformě Banana PI, který bude kompletně otevřený. Jedinou uzavřenou součástí by měl být firmware síťových karet, který ale běží v odděleném procesoru.</span>

Lze jej považovat za konkurenta GLSL a HLSL, ale skutečným záměrem tohoto projektu je zcela zrušit koncept shadingových jazyků.</span>

                              <span>When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It&#x27;s also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

                              <span>I will not lie to you, reader, I used up about 95% of today&#x27;s remaining creative energy/caffeine on that headline joke, but let&#x27;s charge our flashlights, sharpen our hooks and struggle on through the body copy anyway. Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game&#x27;s villainous Entity.
Mind you, I&#x27;m a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight&#x27;s universe, not Behaviour Interactive. &quot;As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back,&quot; it reads. &quot;Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key.&quot; Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

                              <span>Corsair&#x27;s RM1000x Shift power supply is quite a tempting one for any PC build, providing 1000W of power at 80+ Gold efficiency - but the best feature here is its conveniently reachable side-mounted connector placement. Corsair charges a premium for this feature, with the PSU normally going for £160, but today you can pick up a refurbished unit from Scan in the UK for just £110. That&#x27;s a sizeable savings and well worth considering.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever been to Shinjuku station in Japan, you know what it&#x27;s like to be transported to a dizzying realm of limbs and tickets and signage with myriad squiggly lines that make about as much sense as rainbow spaghetti that&#x27;s been hurled at a white rectangle. You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I&#x27;d say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

                              <span>Acts! It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre&#x27;s underpants. One act isn&#x27;t the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which many players feel isn&#x27;t a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG&#x27;s first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act&#x27;s &quot;drastic&quot; tone shift better in future releases. It&#x27;s a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian&#x27;s CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he&#x27;s &quot;figured out&quot; the first act of Larian&#x27;s next unannounced project.

                              <span>It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon&#x27;s secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

                              <span>I have a sneaking affection for slightly jarring genre hybrids - games like the relatively recent Disintegration and the much older Battlezone 2, which smush action mechanics together with real-time strategy, or the rather more elegant Puzzle Quest, in which you roll around a parchment landscape fighting wizards using the power of match-3. New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You&#x27;ll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

The Claw – great name, by the way – actually looks and sounds closer to the Asus ROG Ally than Valve’s handheld, being a Windows 11-based device without any flashy hardware tricks like the Lenovo Legion Go’s detachable controllers. All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.

                              <span>Pirate sites are facing an emerging and potentially global threat of domain name seizures that goes way beyond anything seen before. A pirate site blocking order obtained by the studios of the MPA in India encapsulates the incremental steps taken in recent years. The end result is so expansive that almost any site offering the studios&#x27; content, even that yet to be made, could face perpetual domain name suspensions. No matter where they are in the world.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation&#x27;s Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019&#x27;s Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We&#x27;re thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!

Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it&#x27;s fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game&#x27;s story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory&#x27;s Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It&#x27;s unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.</span>

                              <span>Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.</span>

                              <span>Building a small form factor PC is difficult. Not only do you have to find the perfect SFF case, but then you have to spec out all of the components to fit inside it - and miniaturised motherboards in particular often come at a premium, especially if you&#x27;re building a current-gen system. 
Thankfully, right now Amazon UK is doing a great deal on ASRock&#x27;s best Mini ITX motherboard for Ryzen 7000 CPUs, with a £146 asking price that comes 20% below its £187 RRP and more than £20 cheaper than the next-closest UK retailer.

                              <span>It is said that for every human being in existence there is a dedicated species of job simulator, a variety of job sim that speaks to that person, body and soul. In my case, that job sim  is Medieval Machines Builder, probably better known as Siege Weapon Builder.
Its free-to-play prologue goes live later this week, on top of a demo from last year. I haven&#x27;t played either the prologue or the demo and who knows, they could be rubbish, but look, I had to spend three hours this morning queuing for an appointment, and all I wanted to do during those three hours was cobble together a trebuchet from plastic chairs and retractable tape. Let me do a quick 400 words on this? Pretty please?

The announcement, part of the GPU giant’s CES 2024 showcase, was light on specifics about gaming performance – but all three promise marked improvements on their 40 series predecessors. And, in the RTX 4080 Super’s case, even a big ol&#x27; price drop.

Can you fight your way out of a Nazi bunker when everything is controlled by clicking? Even simply moving involves clicking on pictures of your left and right shoes, moving faster as you alternate shoes faster. Neural Parasite is short and it&#x27;s free, so hop to it! Or, click on one of your shoes to hop to it, I suppose.

Said executive is a 57-year-old who worked at the company from 2014; apparently, he and six other men aged 47 or older were cut from a team of 200, as part of broader Activision Blizzard restructuring efforts last August.

                              <span>Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.
The usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.

I asked the Maw if it had any 2024 resolutions last Friday, and it responded with the brain-splitting clamour of a million fell voices crying out in anguish. I have run this through our Chthonic Translator and the short version is that it wants to get down the gym now and then.
Some new game releases we are tip-toeing towards with our shields raised this week, in case they turn out to be Mimics: Allison Road-inspired horror Supernormal (8th Jan), free turn-based dungeon crawler Buriedbornes2 (10th Jan), medical management sim War Hospital (11th Jan), feudal Chinese spin-off Reigns: Three Kingdoms (11th Jan), pleasingly nonsensically-named retro RPG Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk (13th Jan).

In addition to working on nearly every acclaimed Final Fantasy game since Nomura also helped create the Kingdom Hearts series and has become a figurehead and luminary within the stacked ranks of Square Enix&#x27;s stable of developers. But this 2015 trip to Los Angeles, California, was different.
PlayStation&#x27;s E3 2015 livestream had just revealed a teaser trailer featuring the iconic Final Fantasy VII protagonist, Cloud Strife, walking through Midgar in glorious, modern, HD graphics. The dream of so many – a remake of the classic RPG – was finally realized. The fans weren&#x27;t the only ones feeling the weight …</span>

It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at Variety with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. 
Haddad told Variety that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it&#x27;s the best-selling game of the year &quot;in the entire industry worldwide.&quot; Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release.

Even Sony&#x27;s PlayStation VR2 launch last year seemed to come and go with little fanfare (and even less support for the platform nearly a year later). However, tech giant Apple is making its own case for VR and it&#x27;s doing so with the $3,500 Vision Pro headset launching next month. 
While we&#x27;ve known about the headset and its, frankly, absurd price since last year, today, the company announced that preorders for it will begin on Friday, January 19, with a launch on February 2.

In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint.

Persona 3 was no exception and its imminent remake Persona 3 Reload seems only to be pushing it into the modern era. 

As proof, Atlus have released the opening movie for Reload - that is, the two-minute intro sequence that&#x27;ll play at the start of the game.

                              <span>Reigns is a kingdom management game which boils narrative choice down to its simplest form, by presenting the player with a long series of binary choices they swipe left or right on. From that basic interaction, it spins enjoyable yarns with some strategic underpinnings.

It&#x27;s had several followups and spin-offs since, and it&#x27;s about to get another. Reigns: Three Kingdoms, which lets you swipe your way through anccient China, will launch on January 11th.

Let me tell you, I have started off the new year anxious as heck, and despite insisting I wouldn&#x27;t watch the Hootenanny (never the Hootenanny) I once again watched the Hootenanny. Jools loves his boogie woogie. I can&#x27;t say for sure the two things - the angs and the boogie woogie - are related, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. You know what definitely soothes anxiety?

                              <span>When Final Fantasy VII launched on PlayStation in 1997, it revolutionized the RPG genre and gaming as a whole. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. 
For the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. &quot;Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We&#x27;re curious to see how the series follows up Season 1&#x27;s dramatic conclusion. Season 2&#x27;s cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.</span>

                              <span>Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you&#x27;ve ever played a Persona game, you&#x27;re likely familiar with the &quot;opening movie,&quot; which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload&#x27;s release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called &quot;Full Moon Full Life.&quot; 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below:

                              <span>Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven&#x27;t played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 or Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I&#x27;d finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. 
What did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of &#x27;em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn&#x27;t even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I&#x27;m pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I&#x27;m allergic to anything over four hours - and I don&#x27;t like it.

                              <span>Seemingly not content with having raised over $650 million for a game in development for over a decade without a full release date in sight, Star Citizen is now offering a new way for those with too much money to spend it: a bundle of digital ships costing £46,000.

                              <span>This past Christmas marked the anniversary of me playing Overwatch 2. 7 years of my partner and I swearing at seemingly impenetrable enemy teams, then whooping in victory when we finally pull together a plan that cracks them apart - or just as our chill W+M1 game while we chat about our days.
For the uninitiated, Overwatch is a bright, colorful, and very funny team v team FPS that ditches the dour gunmen for a cast that doesn’t all require raw aim skill. Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there&#x27;s never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.

The article is so voluminous I’m not sure I have the energy to check. I get halfway down the page and feel like I need to pitch camp below one of the paragraph breaks, like a mountaineer sleeping beneath a crag in one of those dangling tents. Assuming we didn’t, both have been slated for 2024 release by the PlayStation blog.

                              <span>The first week of January is always one of my favourite times of the year. It&#x27;s a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I&#x27;ll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year&#x27;s resolutions. Traditionally, I don&#x27;t often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I&#x27;m aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more &#x27;nice to haves&#x27; rather than &#x27;musts&#x27;, I&#x27;d say. 
This year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you&#x27;ve also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco.

                              <span>Much as I enjoyed Spellcaster University, I was surprised it was so successful. Its dependency on randomly assigning you buildings differentiated it from the kind of full management game I&#x27;d expected, and which I assumed most people would want.
Happily, I was wrong: it did fine. Happilyer still, Mind Over Magic is here (though in early access) to provide a somewhat more traditional design, and it&#x27;s already compelling enough to turn my quick test into a seven hour delve.

                              <span>I watched Studio Ghibli&#x27;s latest film The Boy And The Heron the other day, having gone in basically blind. I knew it would be the case, but I left the cinema and said to my mate, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what just happened but what happened was great&quot;. It was a lot of things! A visual feast. Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.
Since then, we&#x27;ve listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It&#x27;s all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning. Much like Souls, Ghibli&#x27;s latest only expands as you reflect on it.

                              <span>Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread creators Bossa Studios have laid off around a third of their staff, with 19 people departing the London, UK-based independent in December due to what co-founder Henrique Olifiers has called &quot;a perfect storm of events&quot; - heavy competition from blockbuster games at the backend of last year, increased operating costs, and delayed funding decisions across the industry.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is &quot;also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media&quot; and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That&#x27;s the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima&#x27;s latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There&#x27;s a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn&#x27;t outright necessary to prevail.
I doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it&#x27;s an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.

Published by Hollogram TV, the articles both featured positive news about Plex, based on information released to the media by Plex. The copyright complaints were filed at Facebook by anti-piracy outfit Markscan, acting on behalf of Plex.

The government has asked stakeholders for input on a copyright law amendment that would empower a local consumer protection watchdog to block copyright-infringing websites. Digital rights activists fear further normalization of Internet censorship.

                              <span>The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

                              <span>PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game&#x27;s launch update. But if you&#x27;re looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>First, there was the Xbox Series X mini-fridge, and now the Series S gets its own appliance in the form of a toaster. Bread will never be the same again. 
Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. 
Those interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.</span>

                              <span>When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the &quot;hypertapping&quot; one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and &quot;rolling,&quot; discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

                              <span>Super-powered MMO City Of Heroes closed down in November 2012, but in recent years it has been revived by industrious fans via privately-hosted servers. While those servers allowed caped crusaders to continue roleplaying, the caveat was that they could be shut down at any moment by the most dastardly supervillains of all: lawyers.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes&#x27; IP owners NCSoft.

Apex Legends is the latest live service game to take the plunge with its first crossover event. It&#x27;s with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it&#x27;ll bring the Buster Sword, Aerith, and other elements from the JRPG to the battle royale on January 9th.

Alas, it didn&#x27;t meet Square Enix&#x27;s sales expectations.

Now it&#x27;s free via the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it&#x27;s decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania&#x27;s locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine&#x27;s last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game&#x27;s approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you&#x27;ll find in many games.

                              <span>Russian Roulette is just an edgy version of Snakes &amp; Ladders. It&#x27;s pure luck gussied up with high stakes and the cool aesthetic of spinning a six-shooter. A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people&#x27;s teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That&#x27;s Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

                              <span>Happy New Year, folks! Have you recovered from the all the 100+ hour RPGs that came out last year? Well, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official &quot;big&#x27;uns&quot; calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what&#x27;s on our personal wishlists for 2024.

                              <span>Rockfish have announced that they&#x27;re updating arcade dogfighter Everspace 2 to run on Unreal Engine 5. The engine rollover will arrive as part of or alongside the game&#x27;s Incursions update in spring 2024, which includes tweaks and bugfixes as well as extra legendary items and a new game feature of some description. The idea is less to take advantage of UE5&#x27;s various whizbangs and bellwhistles, like the new Nanite geometry system, than to grease the launch chutes for future Everspace 2 updates and expansions.

                              <span>Having spent some time in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Hawaii, I&#x27;ve come to realise that it&#x27;s a wonderful place, home to trams that&#x27;ll let you see the sights and soak in the warm breeze. But moreso than that, it&#x27;s home to the previous game&#x27;s Pokémon parody, Sujimon, which has now kicked into overdrive. From what I can tell, Infinite Wealth is as much a Pokémon trainers paradise as it is a game about the Japanese criminal underworld. I&#x27;m sold.

                              <span>We got our first look at Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Dondoko Island at last year&#x27;s Xbox Partner showcase. Right as it dropped, I was in New York giving the Animal Crossing-esque minigame a go myself, albeit for a quickfire half hour of bashing rubbish bags with a baseball bat and plonking a urinal on the dirt to satisfy a tutorial. Still, in that brief time I&#x27;ve come away thinking I could lose much of my life to the promise of converting a polluted island into an idyll with the power of abs and friendship. There is the strong possibility of a grind. But hey, it&#x27;s optional!

                              <span>Well, well, well. Of all the detectives in all the world, she came to me. She was a dame with hair red as communion wine spilled by a bishop looking at a nun&#x27;s cleava- oh what, wait, she&#x27;s how old? Christ, Philip, get your head out of the gutter for once, this is a family website. I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they&#x27;re actually really good. We&#x27;re going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998&#x27;s Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there&#x27;s a lot to love about it right away. There&#x27;s a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil&#x27; cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I&#x27;m as disappointed as you.

Twitch have updated their attire policies to stop an outbreak of &quot;implied nudity&quot; among thirstier streamers, who have taken to filming themselves nude with black censor bars, or positioning the camera to suggest that they&#x27;re fully or partially naked outside the frame.

Thus far, fifty people have been handed a €140 fine, mostly for sharing pirated movies on the private torrent tracker Linkomanija. According to a local lawyer, these measures will reduce piracy, but traffic to the country&#x27;s largest torrent site seems unaffected.

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.
Speaking to the Polish outlet Parkiet, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”

Final Fantasy VII Remake gave fans of the original game quite a shock as Cloud and the party exited Midgar. Zack, the protagonist of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a key figure in Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth&#x27;s past, appears to be alive, and helped an injured Cloud reach Midgar. This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud. 
Zack&#x27;s changed fate is emblematic of how the Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth teams approached the source material. &quot;If we trace the original and stay exactly loyal to it a…</span>

                              <span>On January 1, Steamboat Willie, the cartoon that introduced the world to Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, meaning the first version of Disney’s iconic mascot is (mostly) free to use by anyone. And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey.

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on January 30.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which gaming platform do you see yourself using the most in 2024 and why?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>Jack Black has joined the cast of the in-development live-action Minecraft movie. Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic &quot;Peaches,&quot; too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Black himself even nodded to the news in an Instagram post that showed him reading a Minecraft Basics for Dummies book. However, neither he nor the fi…</span>

                              <span>Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket&#x27;s first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer&#x27;s Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

The 280mm size AiO in white is now down to $200 after a $70 discount, and highly recommended by this writer at that price.

                              <span>German peripherals manufacturer Roccat has made some great keyboards and mice over the years, although they&#x27;re not as well known in the US as they are in their native Europe. Today that could change in a small way, as Roccat&#x27;s excellent Pyro mechanical keyboard is down to $40 at Amazon US. That&#x27;s 50% off its original price and a solid $10 off its usual going price, making it well worth picking up.

To prevent abuse, several thousand hashes were banned over the past year.

                              <span>Unlike the UK, where Premiership stars are effectively firewalled from the national piracy controversy, players from Manchester United, Liverpool, and Everton publicly support the Premier League&#x27;s &#x27;Boot Out Piracy&#x27; campaign in Asia. In parallel, the Vietnamese government has just published a list of sites subject to an advertising ban, which includes some of the most resilient football piracy sites. To cite a Jaws analogy, Casemiro and friends need a bigger boat.

                              <span>Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term &quot;late&quot; has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, &quot;the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.&quot; So, Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney&#x27;s official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, &quot;And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.&quot;
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven&#x27;t spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game&#x27;s narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols. This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.

                              <span>Beginning in 1989, the Prince of Persia series enjoyed consistent attention, with its longest break between releases being six years between Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame and the better-left forgotten Prince of Persia 3D. 2003’s Sands of Time and its two sequels marked a new era for Prince and, in many ways, laid the foundation for Ubisoft’s most successful franchise, Assassin’s Creed. The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…</span>
