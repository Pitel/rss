While some would argue that this year&#x27;s PlayStation GOTY contendership battle was a two-horse race, it still seemed somewhat foolish to bet against Bandai Namco&#x27;s dark fantasy adventure. From its initial announcement, FromSoftware&#x27;s next release had the fanbase practically frothing at the mouth. Convinced, purely off the back of the studio&#x27;s pedigree, that something genre-defining was on the march. And, to the surprise of nobody, when launch day came, Elden Ring delivered.
And how.
Players were immediately enraptured by The Lands Between, falling into some sort of strange love affair with its oppressive grimness, frightening environments, and skin-crawling giant spider hands. Eager gluttons for punishment, players gladly submitted themselves to the lash of Elden Ring&#x27;s whip, sad…</span>

Statutory body GfK has released the final UK Chart placings before Christmas, revealing that Electronic Arts&#x27; football sim FIFA 23 is officially 2022&#x27;s Christmas No.1, at least in regard to physical game sales.
Riding high on a wave of World Cup fever, FIFA 23 successfully fended off advances from both Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s God of War: Ragnarok in order to retain its number one position for the coveted Christmas weekend. For many years now, the battle to be the star atop the Christmas Tree has been waged between the FIFA and Call of Duty franchises. FIFA has now taken the spot on 10 separate occasions, while Call of Duty has racked up a still-impressive nine.
FIFA 23 represents the serie…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s an easy thing to miss!
On my first go-around with the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard Tera Raid event, I completely missed that you can hatch a Charmander. I saw the official restriction of &quot;only one Charizard can be earned from raids per save file&quot; and took it at face value.
So on this second run, I just threw caution to the wind and tried to breed a Charizard to see what would happened. The results? Lots of new Charmanders to give out! Here&#x27;s how to breed one and evolve it.

Use the standard egg hatching method with Ditto and your Tera Raid Charizard
There&#x27;s nothing really new here that you need to do: just use the same egg hatching method, but have Ditto and your raid Charizard in your party.
Start a picnic, and if you want, eat an egg-based sandwich to increase the rate in which eggs trigger. After some time passes at your picnic with the aforementioned parameters, walk over to the basket on the other side of the picnic table, and see if there&#x27;s an egg in there (there could be multiple!).
If you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here.

Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16, and Charizard at level 36
After hatching, the default Charmander will have the scratch and growl moves as a level 1 Pokemon. You can find the stats of my particular Charmander above.
Note that you can evolve your Charmander as normal. At level 16, it&#x27;ll turn into a Charmeleon, and at level 36, it&#x27;ll evolve into a Charizard.

Fortnite developer Epic Games has announced today that it will pay a total of $520 million in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. The total amount is accrued between two complaints, over privacy violations and tricking players into unintended purchases.
The FTC originally claimed that Epic violated the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, by collecting personal data from children without obtaining parental consent. Having voice and text chat on by default in the settings while matching these players with strangers also harmed children and teens, the FTC alleges.
The Commission also claims Epic deployed trickery to &quot;dupe&quot; players, causing them to make unintended purchases and blocking access to purchase…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s coming up very soon
If you want to get your hands on a Cinderace in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, you may want to prep for 7 star Tera Raids soon-ish.
Thanks to Serebii.net, we now know that there is going to be a 7 star Cinderace event running on December 30, with a &quot;second chance&quot; coming on January 13. This is the exact same scheme as the Charizard raid events, but there&#x27;s a little more leeway here to finish up the requirements (which includes not only finishing the base game, but some postgame as well).
As a reminder, you&#x27;ll only be able to catch this particular raid-based Pokemon once per save file, and it will be a fighting tera type: with the mightiest mark (again, similar to Charizard). It will also likely follow suit with Charizard in that it will not be part of the Paldea Pokedex.
The first Scarlet &amp; Violet Cinderace Tera Raid battle event will start on December 30
Clear out your schedule if you really want Cinderace, as you&#x27;ll need to do some prep before December 30 rolls around. To unlock the ability to play against 7 star raids, you&#x27;ll need to complete the story, finish all of the gyms again in the postgame, then clear the Mesagoza tournament. After that, you&#x27;ll want to seek out 10 five star raids (you need to host them/find them yourself on the map): then you can unlock 6 and 7 star raids.
We have a full guide here for getting ready for 7 star raids.
Here are the full dates for each event:
December 30, 2022 -January 1, 2023
January 13, 2022 - January 15, 2023

                              <span>Spectator mode, replays, online stability and more
Earlier this month, publisher 3goo released the 2005 2D fighting title The Rumble Fish 2 onto modern consoles, offering the unique scrapper its first worldwide home release ever. Unfortunately, despite the quality of the game itself, the release was a woefully disappointing way to present this long-lost classic.
The new release of Rumble Fish 2 forces 16x9 widescreen support, has a soft filter by default, does not support keyboard for its Steam release, and is missing rudimentary fighting game features for its online modes, such as lobbies, a replay function, and even the ability to rematch your opponent. Additionally, The Rumble Fish 2 is priced at $30, and locks three characters behind an additional $10 paywall. Yikes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;gtrhFxv-2WA&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;3goo
Following a slew of negative feedback directed toward The Rumble Fish 2 on Steam, a developer has responded to the &quot;Top Review&quot;, suggesting that an update is incoming. The update is aiming to add some of the requested features, including savable replays, a spectator mode, additional practice mode settings, and more. A separate update also rolled out on all platforms today, which fixes several unspecified issues with the game&#x27;s online and offline modes.
It&#x27;s a big positive to see 3goo address some of the issues with this disappointing release. A 4x3 option would be essential, as dedicated players are discovering that the forced 16x9 ratio is, incredibly, causing some wall-bounce combos to break. Additionally, the locked DLC characters should be addressed, whether the publisher caves and offers the trio to all players, or simply reduces the retail price of the base game. There is still much to do to make The Rumble Fish 2 an appealing release, but this update is a start.
The Rumble Fish 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>I&#x27;d use it!
Over the years we&#x27;ve covered quite a few fan made Switch-related projects, and many of them are docks. This one too!
From the mind of reggtegg over on Reddit, this working Switch dock recreates the aesthetic of Generation 4: aka the Sinnoh region from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The design looks big, but it&#x27;s functional, and perfectly replicates the look of the Pokecenter from that series of games. Man, I miss those escalators.
If you&#x27;re interested, here is their Etsy store. They mention that they will be &quot;releasing this as an item in the next week or so.&quot; It&#x27;ll be using a Polymaker Terra filament for a &quot;cool matte texture.&quot;
Sinnoh is making a comeback
Truth be told, Sinnoh was the first region where I missed out on playing a new generational Pokemon game day one. I had a lot going on in my life in 2007, and most of my Pokemon-playing friends went to other colleges, or fell out of love with the series. It wasn&#x27;t until I started playing with my wife that I really had an excuse to get back into it in earnest, and my fondness for the franchise was rekindled.
Now Sinnoh is back for real with Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in the mix, keeping the region alive for a new generation of players.

                              <span>A legacy foretold
Square Enix, confirming recent whispers, has officially announced that the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series will be released on PS4 and Nintendo Switch platforms in the spring of 2023, following on from the titles&#x27; previous release on PC and mobile platforms back in 2021.
The Pixel Remaster series contains the first six mainline titles from the iconic RPG franchise, with each release featuring crisp, HD visuals, overhauled controls, a redesigned U.I., and several quality-of-life features. In addition, each game&#x27;s memorable score has been composed by the series&#x27; veteran maestro Nobuo Uematsu. The series includes Final Fantasy I-VI, dating all the way back to 1987.

Square Enix announced that the six games will be available to purchase digitally as a bundle or as separate releases. In addition, two physical releases were also announced as Square Enix store exclusives. Unfortunately, given the late-night timing of the official announcement, these editions essentially sold out while many fans were in slumberland. A &quot;waiting list&quot; for a $75 Standard Edition and a $260 Anniversary Edition is now available on the Square Enix Store, and hopefully, both titles will be restocked.
The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series affords players the opportunity to witness the birth of a legend, readily available on modern platforms and looking better than ever before. Porting these classic RPGs to PlayStation and Switch platforms only further ensures that a little bit of gaming history can be retold to younger audiences, setting the stage for the litany of incredible adventures to come.
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series launches on PS4 and Nintendo Switch spring 2023.

In a post on the official FTC website, the agency confirmed that the developer will pay a $275 million penalty for violating children’s privacy law along with $245 million worth of refunds for tricking users into making unwanted purchases.

                              <span>It takes two (Switches).
At first glance, UNDERSCORE and Joy Brick&#x27;s brand new puzzle adventure, Aliisha: The Oblivion of Twin Goddesses, shows plenty of promise in how it&#x27;s been designed from the ground up for two players to indulge in lots of cooperative sleuthing action that makes full use of the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s unique range of abilities.
Here we&#x27;ve got a puzzler that allows two friends to work together in order to solve a series of impressively atmospheric multiroom head-scratchers, each assuming the role of one of two sisters, Aisha and Lisha, who&#x27;ve just stumbled upon a huge underground temple full of mysteries and ancient magic. What&#x27;s most neat here is that one player uses their Switch in handheld mode whilst the other gets busy with their Joy-Cons in docked mode — using a required second Switch — in order to explore the world on offer, making sure that the console&#x27;s gyro controls and touchscreen are all put to work as you push through the campaign.

Forever Entertainment has announced that Front Mission 1st: Remake has been updated to version 1.0.3, bringing with it a host of new options, gameplay improvements, and bug fixes.
Hopefully there&#x27;s enough here to alleviate some fears you might have of the experience. After all, our review ended with a decidedly average score of 5/10, in which we highlighted the sluggish combat and random weapons. Nevertheless, we praised the visuals, story, and soundtrack, so there may be enough here to warrant a purchase if you&#x27;re a fan of the original.

A lot of fans have seen Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as a chance to be creative. We have seen people discovering Shiny &#x27;mon by searching the walls, speeding around Paldea with controller hacks and even reaching party step goals by jumping on roofs. But the level of creativity that we have spotted from one fan (thanks, Go Nintendo) is a lot less to do with exploiting game breaks and more about an eye for design.
Last week, Reddit user u/reggtegg took to the r/pokemon channel to share their newly-designed Switch Dock casing which looks just like one of the Sinnoh region&#x27;s Pokémon Centers. One glance at the images below and we cannot get that pesky theme music out of our heads, but we must admit that the 3D-printed model is pretty darn accurate.

One of the most common complaints thrown at the Switch (at least in the last year or so) is that it&#x27;s starting to look slightly antiquated when compared to the likes of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or even Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck.
The easiest thing for most people (this writer included) is to simply stick it out and wait for Nintendo to announce and launch something a bit beefier, but what if you&#x27;re just not willing to wait? Are there any viable alternatives out there to satisfy your handheld gaming needs? Well, yes; the aforementioned Steam Deck, for one. What you might not have heard of, however, is the Aya Neo Air, a portable gaming device that runs on Windows 11 and is significantly more powerful than the Switch.

Confirmed by @SerebiiNet there will be a further two Tera Raid Battle events this year, with the latter stretching into 2023. First up, we will be facing Delibird in One- to Five-Star Raid Battles from 23rd-25th December. There will be no set Tera Type for this event (be prepared for anything!) and various different Tera Shards will be available as a reward.

                              <span>How was your year for PC hardware, reader? Pick up anything nice, or got any old favourite gear still going strong? I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

It&#x27;s a thing with a free public beta you can play right now, and it&#x27;s a good enough thing to be worth the risk of your boss coming over to ask why your screen is full of gorgeous battling wizards and creatures rather than spreadsheets. 
Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it&#x27;s more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

                              <span>I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

                              <span>After all these years of going fast, it would appear that Sonic (T. Hedgehog) has finally arrived. He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself.

                              <span>As fun as it is to declare something &quot;a tradition&quot; and blithely repeat it year after year to entertain myself, it has been quite magic to see other people anticipate and adopt the things I&#x27;ve declared RPS Christmas traditions. That&#x27;s all you need to form tradition: people who want to experience something together. No matter how slight or daft the thing is, what really matters is that we do it together. So please, reader dear, join me for an annual play of Skeal, a wonderful (and free) festive single-joke game.

They say the update to the update &quot;should improve the overall stability and performance&quot;, which will hopefully be especially good news for anyone trying to de-neck nekkers on an ageing graphics card.

Custom controller maker Super Louis 64’s done just that, crafting a Buster Sword that lets him play through Final Fantasy 7 Remake in true Cloud style. When he shared a clip of his antics on Twitter, Super Louis insisted the whole game is playable using the big knife. The honorary Soldier says he’s hoping to have a full video of his time spent pretending to be Cloud up on his YouTube channel today.

                              <span>Microsoft may be considering a lower-priced tier of their Game Pass service, with a few adjustments from the current standard options. A Spanish-language survey shared on ResetEra has allegedly shown the company asking current subscribers whether they’d be up for cheaper Game Pass for PC and console, if that reduction came with a delay for first-party games or running ads. It’s worth taking this with a heavy pinch of salt though, as there’s no confirmed source to the survey.

It’s also a relatively peaceful game to add to your pile ahead of the beckoning wintertide break, thanks to the complete lack of combat. John Lennon would be chuffed.

Will it be Elden Ring? Or maybe God of War Ragnarök? What about the impressive indie underdog, Neon White? We also liked Tunic quite a lot. We will be sharing our picks for the game and games of the year in the next issue of Game Informer magazine with [redacted] on the cover, but we also want to hear from our readers and share your favorites of 2022.
To do that, we ask that you fill out the poll below. Send us your personal list of 2022&#x27;s five best games and we will gather everyone&#x27;s information and share the result early.

                              <span>Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series&#x27; first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here&#x27;s a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a &quot;small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023,&quot; but notes that quantities will be &quot;extremely limited&quot; so if you&#x27;re interested, you should preorder.

                              <span>With the great AMD 4th Gen EPYC Linux performance showing significant generational uplift and dominating against the current Xeon Scalable &quot;Ice Lake&quot; competition, it&#x27;s a combination of the twelve channels of DDR5 system memory support, up to 96 cores per socket, introduction of AVX-512, and other Zen 4 micro-architectural improvements. As follow-up testing articles to all of the Genoa data delivered thus far, over the weeks ahead I have additional benchmark results to share looking more closely at these different areas of improvement for AMD 4th Gen EPYC. In today&#x27;s article is a look at the EPYC 9654 2P performance with AVX-512 on/off while also looking at the CPU power consumption impact and the affect on CPU clock frequencies and thermals.</span>

Meanwhile, other sites are being targeted, including the popular Soccerstreams portal.

Licensed video games have always been like the interior of an abandoned barn. Sometimes you might find a long-abandoned car that is in dire need of restoration, but more likely, it’s just full of spiders. Die Hard on NES is neither of those things. It’s more like finding a long-abandoned lunar lander in an old barn. You wonder how it got there and if it’s a good idea to try it out.
It’s an absolutely bizarre game that transcends the discussion of whether it’s good or crap. It’s fascinating. The design is something that isn’t exactly without comparison, but the way it functions is out of this world.

Haaaaans!
I’d recommend watching Die Hard before playing this game. While knowing the movie is rarely needed for playing the licensed game, it’s practically requir…</span>

Good day, friends and lovers, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? As Bing once told us, it&#x27;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, and I hope that next week will bring you some holiday and respite from the daily grind. The holidays have whizzed up on me this season, mostly due to how insanely busy I&#x27;ve been on the Good Ship Destructoid as it continues to adapt to its shiny new regime. There&#x27;s a long way to go, but at least we&#x27;ve gotten started (behind the curtain at least).

                              <span>Setting fear aside for new possibilities
My entire life, I’ve been really, really sensitive to horror. I usually chalk it up to being raised in a fundamentalist Christian family where I was told from a very young age that not only are Satan and demons real, but they are coming to get me and I have to actively fight them from taking control of my mind. Either that or I’m just a little too sensitive. Who’s to say?
Regardless, some of my childhood memories involve scary movies, or rather, my aversion to watching them. At my best friend’s sleepover birthday party in middle school, I spent an entire two hours upstairs by myself because I was too scared of whatever crappy C-tier horror flick they turned on that night. I once fled a family viewing of What Lies Beneath in tears because it was just…</span>

                              <span>A Prelude to all future RPGs.
Final Fantasy is now 35 years old, and that feels a little bit weird to say. While not the first RPG series to ever grace a home console or even the first Japanese-developed RPG, Final Fantasy is, arguably, the JRPG. Everyone knows it, and everyone has played at least one.
There’s a lot of debate about what Final Fantasy as a franchise really is, and over the last 20 years, a lot of people have felt disappointed by huge overhauls to combat or setting. But there is no one kind of Final Fantasy. I can’t really think of any other series that has changed as much and as often as Final Fantasy has. Right back to its origins, Final Fantasy has always managed to innovate, iterate, and reinvent.

                              <span>Every mainline Final Fantasy on Nintendo systems, ranked by you.
Today marks the 35th anniversary of the Final Fantasy franchise, with the original game having launched in Japan on 18th December 1987. That&#x27;s just one day after Capcom kicked off the Mega Man series, too — a pretty epic one-two punch for Famicom gamers heading into that particular late-&#x27;80s weekend, no?
In celebration of 35 years of epic RPG-ing, we&#x27;re republishing this reader-ranked list of the best games in the series (available on Nintendo consoles, that is).

Hi everyone, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
In last week&#x27;s brawl, we took a look at the GBA karting classic, Mario Kart Super Circuit. North America and Europe joined forces against Japan and came away with the win, garnering a whopping 75% of the vote. It&#x27;s clear that the more simplistic composition proved exceptionally popular with readers, and we have to say, we firmly agree.

One of the video game highlights of 2022 was Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s PlayStation exclusive God of War Ragnarok. The game arrived last month, and now that it&#x27;s been released to fans around the globe, it seems there&#x27;s some movement within the studio.
God of War Ragnarok and God of War (2018) gameplay producer Hannah Foell has left the studio to become senior manager of partner management at Nintendo of America. Here she&#x27;ll be helping build developer and publisher relationships with &#x27;AAA&#x27; teams - to help bring &quot;new experiences&quot; to players on Nintendo platforms.

                              <span>The Knight Witch deserves more attention than it&#x27;s getting. It&#x27;s a Metroidvania shmup in which you fly about, blast enemies with guns, and cast spells from a deck of cards. For all the bang and zip of the combat, it&#x27;s also deeply cosy, with lush 2D art and sweet character relationships in an underground post-apocalyptic world that&#x27;s still somehow filled with plants, rustic cabins and cute market stalls. There&#x27;s a free demo to play now.

                              <span>Early December, prolific Genshin Impact leaker &#x27;Ubatcha&#x27; was targeted in a DMCA subpoena application filed by publisher Cognosphere. Since then the subpoena has been characterized in various ways, from a full-blown lawsuit to a matter that&#x27;s best ignored. Both are incorrect but there is a broad middle ground. With Ubatcha promising no more leaks, will that put this issue to rest?

Autumn Games has revealed its plans for the coming year as it pertains to the fantastic Skullgirls 2nd Encore, which has, impressively, enjoyed a full decade of exciting, tag-fighting action — fending off competition from a plethora of fighting game releases, large and small, to carve itself a niche in the competitive scene.
And it seems that the party is only just getting started.

As we enter 2023, Skullgirls 2nd Encore will begin a year-long rollout of new characters, console ports, balance updates, and new merchandise, celebrating a full decade of fist-throwin&#x27;, hair-slammin&#x27;, charleston-boppin&#x27; action. The initial impact will be felt via the official launch of the ruthless Black Dahlia — the amoral assassin of The Medici Crime Family…</span>

The NES library has north of 700 games on it. That’s a lot, but in terms of successful consoles, it’s kind of in the mid-range. It still makes it difficult to choose any number of the best games. That’s probably why no one has been brave enough to make a Top X NES games list. I’m not saying I’m the bravest person in the world, but I am saying I have no shame.
One thing to note is that while I’ve played a staggeringly wide range of the NES library, I haven’t played everything. For example, I haven’t played Bases Loaded 3, and I’m open to the possibility that it’s the apogee of the NES library. This also isn’t about which games were most popular or influential. That’s another topic. These ones are the best for a myriad of other reasons.

There is something of a rarity joining the Arcade Archives this week, in as much as it&#x27;s a title I&#x27;ve never actually played! Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it&#x27;s Namco platformer Marvel Land!
Released to arcades in 1990, Marvel Land is a fantasy adventure that sees players guide a young hero, Prince Paco, through a series of colorful and hazardous stages on a quest to rescue the adorable Princess Luxie, who has been abducted by the wicked Mole King. What follows is typically cute platforming fare, as Paco negotiates &quot;Marvel Land&quot;, essentially an amusement park wherein the Mole King resides.
As such, the adventure consists of dashing and jumping through numerous rides and attractions, while battling the mad monarch&#x27;s rodent army — The Mogles — and their various lieutenants. To aid him on his quest, Prince Paco can gather various power-ups including dragon wings, speed shoes, and a secondary clone to double the fun, double the pleasure.
Check out all the fun of the fair in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.

While the arcade edition of Marvel Land was rarely seen on the circuit, the game would be ported to the Sega Mega Drive, newly monikered as Talmit&#x27;s Adventure — quite possible to avoid attracting the ire of Spider-Man-lovin&#x27; lawyers. In a cute touch, Marvel Land features a stage that takes place in a parade, which features a who&#x27;s who of classic Namco characters, including Pooka from Dig Dug, Gilgamesh and Ki from Tower of Druaga, Pacet from Baraduke, Mappy, my girl Wonder Momo, and, of course, Pac-Man. Coincidentally, almost all games referenced in Marvel Land are also available as part of the Arcade Archives.
Marvel Land is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Do you know who has tons of fans? Me? Well, you&#x27;re very kind but no, I&#x27;m kinda lonely... Erm... Anyway, the answer I was looking for was Guilty Gear yo-yo spinner, Bridget, as demonstrated by the huge amount of fan art, cosplay, and other prjects dedicated to the young lassie online. Case in point: This wonderful fan animation, produced by the super-talented artist/animator Liz Caingcoy.
The 45-second short sees our gal making the most of a bright and sunny afternoon, taking to the streets with her yo-yo and plush companion, Roger, in tow. It&#x27;s a pretty delightful affair, and who could possibly expect things to get surprisingly... out of hand. The animation is masterfully created out of textured wireforms, which were designed and built within the software package Autodesk Maya. This gives the short its curious and highly recognizable &quot;&#x27;90s PlayStation Cutscene&quot; vibe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;GiwbfME8g-o
If you take a look at some of Caingcoy&#x27;s tweets, you can see the Bridget model in its raw form, which spotlights the authentic textures applied to  Bridget in order to perfectly replicate her Guilty Gear Strive style. Be sure to check out some of Caingcoy&#x27;s animations over on her YouTube channel, and hey, if you&#x27;re a developer in need of an animator, it&#x27;s worth noting that she&#x27;s currently looking for work.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

You can hardly swing a controller in this industry today without hitting at least three different farming sims. The genre has absolutely exploded in the years following Stardew Valley and there seems to be no shortage of developers looking to have players out there hoeing with the best of &#x27;em. In 2022, we saw some fine farm sims, including Harvestella, the Doraemon Story of Seasons sequel, and the absolutely resplendent Wylde Flowers. Looking ahead to 2023, we have Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, Rune Factory 3 Special, Fae Farm, and hopefully the full release of Coral Island. We also have The Winds of Anthos.
Earlier this week, Natsume announced The Winds of Anthos would be the next entry in its Harvest Moon franchise, following last year&#x27;s Harvest Moon: One World.…</span>

The Game Awards actually turned out to be a good show this time around, at least compared to previous years, and it seems the fans agree — Geoff Keighley announced via his Twitter that The Game Awards in 2022 &quot;hit a new viewership milestone&quot; of &quot;103 million livestreams,&quot; making it &quot;the most-watched Game Awards in history.&quot; Keighley goes on to detail some of the stats in the thread under his tweet, including that Twitter&#x27;s stream of the event was a hit this year with 11.5 million viewers, and that the Steam Deck giveaway drew 9.5 million viewers to the platform&#x27;s native stream, with a peak of over 850K concurrent viewers.
That&#x27;s a staggering number of people who tuned in, and I have my own theories as to what caused the numbers to skyrocket this ye…</span>

                              <span>A sizeable shake-up following Criterion&#x27;s latest game
Some changes are being made at Electronic Arts&#x27; Criterion Games, following its latest launch. Five long-time developers at the studio are leaving, just after Criterion launched Need For Speed Unbound.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion GM and VP Matt Webster is leaving the studio after working at Criterion for more than two decades. Head of studio development Alan McDairmant and head of content Steve Uphill are also departing, as well as executive producer Pete Lake and senior technical director Andrei Shires.
All five put in a sizeable chunk of years at the company, and all are leaving to explore &quot;new opportunities outside of EA,&quot; via GIbiz.
David Rutter, the GM of EA&#x27;s racing group, has announced some shifts following these departures. Charity Joy from the EA Sports UFC team is joining as executive producer for Need For Speed, while Codemasters&#x27; Geoff Smith is moving over to take up a spot as senior director of product development. The two join head of studio operations Steve Cuss, who has stayed in his role.
&quot;As we look ahead, we know there’s a strong opportunity to evolve our games and experiences, and bring them to an even broader audience of fans–with our long-term strategy centered on our strengths in licensed motorsports as well as arcade/open-world racing,&quot; said Rutter in a note to staff.

Speed unleashed
The latest Need For Speed, Unbound, rolled in rather suddenly this month. The latest entry in the series takes a different aesthetic approach, leaning on some stylized features that give me some Spider-Verse vibes. Still, it seems like the reception has at least been somewhat solid.
Nevertheless, these are some notable departures for Criterion. Hopefully the long-time racing game studio can lean into the curve on them and come out ahead.

There’s a casket in my parents’ basement. But unlike all the other caskets, this one doesn’t have human remains in it. It contains all my old Pokemon stuff. All of my cards and figures, the Pokemon Power mini-issues that Nintendo Power printed when the first game was approaching release, stickers I printed from Pokemon Snap at a Blockbuster kiosk, the first two movies on DVD; pretty much everything I collected back then, all in this plastic bin.
I didn’t realize it until recently; I had buried this part of my childhood right next to my Star Wars stuff. Back in the day, I was there on day one when Pokemon Red/Blue dropped. Eventually, I fell out of love with it, and it wasn’t just the inexorable march of time eroding my soul; it’s the fact that Pokemon neve…</span>

Today marks the 35th anniversary of the first Mega Man, the game that kickstarted a remarkably iconic franchise in the video game industry, spawning ten direct sequels, multiple spin-off games, comics, tv shows, and more.
The latest entry to the series, Mega Man 11, launched back in 2018 and we thought it was excellent. In our 9/10 review, we praised the slick action gameplay, bold new visual design, and strong replayability. Five years out, however, what exactly would we like to see from a potential sequel?

It has certainly been a festive week this time around at Nintendo Life. We&#x27;ve been busy getting all things ready for the end of the year and are now ready to catch up on all of the great games that we have missed in the meantime.
The week brought us our Nintendo Switch Year in Review (always a reminder that we do, in fact, play surprisingly little) and we put together a list of our most-played games.

The Pokémon Company has announced Ash Ketchum will be hanging up his trainer cap after 25 years early next year. The news has surprised a lot of people around the world including the current voice of Ash, and now it seems the original voice of the character in the long-running anime series has also chimed in.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already hosted a number of distribution events, but this latest one is a bit different. As part of Jump Festa 2023 this weekend, The Pokémon Company is distributing a special Ground Tera Type Gyarados.
Unfortunately, the catch here is you&#x27;ll need to actually be located in Japan to access this limited-time offer. If you are eligible, all you need to do is participate in a demo Tera Raid Battle. You&#x27;ll then receive a serial code that can be used to redeem the Gyarados.

                              <span>The only embarrassing thing is being embarrassed
Since its release in June, the speedrunning first-person parkour shooter Neon White has been plagued by one common criticism. I&#x27;ve heard it more times than I can count, and it comes up as a counterpoint nearly every time I praise the game: &quot;It&#x27;s a good game with bad writing.&quot; The complaint doesn&#x27;t always arrive in those words (I&#x27;ve also heard it described as &quot;so cringy&quot; many times), but the philosophy has pervaded discussion of the game for six months now.
There&#x27;s just one problem: it&#x27;s completely wrong. Neon White is a good game with good writing. And yes, it&#x27;s a good game with writing that sometimes makes me cringe. Most of the jokes are cheap gags about the main character being either stupid or horny. The entire conceit of parkour demons …</span>

                              <span>When it finally drops, you won&#x27;t see me for weeks
It&#x27;s been rumored for years at this point, and fans of the series have been desperately trying to manifest it into existence, but now it&#x27;s official: Guerrilla is working on a Horizon multiplayer project, as they confirmed via their Twitter account today. It wasn&#x27;t so much of an announcement specifically highlighting the upcoming multiplayer game as it was a post of job listings, but it&#x27;s confirmation and that&#x27;s all I care about. Even when these big studios try to play their cards close to their chest, it&#x27;s those darn job listings that always give them away -- they have to make the game somehow, and I find it kind of a fun tradition now that we find out in a kind of indirect way.
https://twitter.com/LifeAtGuerrilla/status/1603752192166469634
The text of the tweet itself is innocent enough, but the studio announces their future plans clearly within the attached graphic. &quot;We are continuing to create epic solo adventures for Aloy. But there is more,&quot; the post reads. &quot;A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in Horizon&#x27;s universe. Featuring a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look, friends will be able to explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together.&quot; Okay, so maybe this time around, the announcement was a bit more direct than usual.
Guerrilla has a whole host of new positions open from Combat Designers to Technical Artists to Programmers, but admittedly the roles that intrigue me the most are the narrative-focused positions. It&#x27;s cool to see that the studio is investing some of its new talent into the storytelling side of things, because Horizon is so well known for its incredible worldbuilding and engaging narrative. I will absolutely be looking forward to any updates on the project, but this announcement alone is enough excitement to keep me going for a while.

                              <span>You only have a few days left
As we mentioned this morning, this is your second chance to dive into a weekend of Charizard raiding (and catching! Well, once!) in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Since then I&#x27;ve seen some confusion as to how to unlock and find these seven-star raids: so here&#x27;s a full breakdown. Remember, you have until December 18 at 3:59PM PT to get your Charizard, or grind out the rewards.
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven&#x27;t already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;354675,354676&quot;]
Locate it on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing dragon icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You&#x27;ll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100, and with an affinity for taking down a dragon/fire type. In any case, we have a full guide on how to take down Charizard here!
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;354677,354678&quot;]
Search for a raid, even if you don&#x27;t have one available
Alternatively, if you don&#x27;t want to host a raid (or don&#x27;t have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Charizard on the list. As soon as you see it click it: as you&#x27;ll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Charizard raids show up, wait for the &quot;check for new postings&quot; sign to light up: then press X to search again.

Fall Guys seems to have just caught the end of the battle royale trend, but it&#x27;s easily one of the silliest and fun games to take on the genre. You and your friends all take on the role of a little bean-shaped creature and run the gauntlet of different obstacle courses akin to the slapstick fun of the classic American gameshow, Wipeout. Don&#x27;t forget you can also dress your bean up in all kinds of goofy costumes to make your run all the more giggle-inducing.
Of course, as much as we all love Fall Guys, any game is going to get a bit stale after we play it for a certain number of hours. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve compiled this list of awesome games to check out if you want to play Fall Guys, but you also don&#x27;t want to play Fall Guys. In other words, here are sev…</span>

                              <span>Sephiroth and Kazuya are right around the corner
[Update: Pre-orders are live! You can find Best Buy links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here, and GameStop links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here. As of publication, Target also has Sephiroth and Kazuya. Thanks CJ!]
Well, Nintendo finally gave us amiibo collectors a lifeline, and revealed the full release date for the Sephiroth and Kazuya figures: January 13, 2023. That&#x27;s soon! Amid that announcement, Nintendo has noted that folks should &quot;look forward to the release of Pyra and Mythra,&quot; which is coming at some point in 2023.
Based on prior release cadences, Smash amiibo release waves are typically five-ish months apart, but they could be coming out sooner than that. In Japan, Pyra and Mythra are being sold as a double pack, but it&#x27;s not clear if that format will be the standard around the world. All that&#x27;s left on the amiibo list now for Super Smash Bros. is Sora. We haven&#x27;t had full confirmation of his figure yet, or when it might release: but mid-to-late-2023 could be possible.
Right now there are no pre-orders available in most regions of the world. However, the Nintendo of Japan store does have all of the above (sans Sora): though they immediately sold out:
Sephiroth
Kazuya
Pyra/Mythra double pack
As always, here&#x27;s a full up to date amiibo list that we&#x27;ve been keeping track of since the beginning. You can also find full images of the amiibo models in the embedded tweet, or the gallery below.

During last week&#x27;s Game Awards, we were introduced to four more characters headed to Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 — And while we were able to gleam some information on Dee Jay, Manon, and Marisa, one particular newcomer remains shrouded in unnerving mystery — the suave gentleman J.P.
We know very, very little about this eldery gent, aside from the fact that he is an extremely rich and powerful individual, essentially holding court over his off-grid nation of Nayshall. Though clearly a man of poise and presence, we are left concerned by his seemingly casual control of what appears to be Psycho Power, the dangerous and ethereal spirit that fueled long-time antagonist M. Bison. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, J.P.&#x27;s overall sense of style and personal interests, …</span>

Fortnite is getting another anime collaboration today, this time with some superpowered stars. Deku, Bakugo, Uraraka, and All Might from My Hero Academia arrive in Fortnite today with purchasable skins and cosmetics in the Item Shop.
Over in the Item Shop, the four aforementioned heroes are getting their own skins and special items. Midoriya&#x27;s skin comes with an All Might Back Bling, for instance, while Bakugo&#x27;s cosmetics are suitably explosive. There are emotes as well, featuring bits like Deku&#x27;s tendency to take notes on heroes and All Might&#x27;s cheerful laugh.

Sorry this review took so long! Our reviewer had the game crash on them on PS5 during the initial process: and after the performance patch. Meanwhile, I had a smoother experience playing The Callisto Protocol: but it didn&#x27;t help all that much.

The Callisto Protocol (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Striking Distance Studios
Publisher: Krafton
Released: December 2, 2022
MSRP: $59.99/$69.99
At first, I was floored to dig more into this world. When your horror adventure starts off with a sci-fi plane crash and the main character (played by a confident Josh Duhamel, who recently did a mean rendition of Harvey Dent/Two-Face in The Killing Joke animated two-parter) is hauled away by hulking robotic guards to prison, I&#x27;m in.

                              <span>Retirement is overrated
Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Chris Metzen, one of the formative creators of the Warcraft franchise, has rejoined the studio to work on future releases in the World of Warcraft series. Metzen retired in 2016, having worked on the fantasy franchise since its formation in the early 1990s.
Metzen&#x27;s return was announced in a statement by current World of Warcraft manager John Hight.
&quot;It is with great joy that I announce Chris Metzen has joined the Warcraft Leadership Team as Creative Advisor. Chris’s focus initially will be on World of Warcraft, then his work will expand to other projects across this growing franchise&quot;, wrote Hight. &quot;We are so happy to be reuniting him with the world he helped create.&quot;

I can already see myself standing in front of my mirror, chanting &quot;I do not need more games&quot; before sitting back down at my desk and splurging on everything I missed from this year&#x27;s RPS advent calendar. 
Valve have given us a peek at what&#x27;s going to be on sale, so click through to see what you should avoid buying until it starts.

You can jump into the frontier of Amazon Games vaguely piratical MMO without paying a penny this weekend, where you&#x27;re free to lark about until December 19th. Has the recent early game overhaul alleviated the opening grind? Perhaps!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t think of a better place for turn-based fights than in the margins of medieval manuscripts. There&#x27;s a wealth of weirdness to draw on, and Inkulinati seems admirably willing to dip its quill into messed-up cats and donkeys playing double-ended trumpets. We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for it, but we&#x27;ll only have to wait a little longer, as developers Yaza Games have just announced they&#x27;ll be launching on Steam Early Access on January 31st.
They&#x27;ve also sketched out a new demo to tide us over, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed my little poke at it.

                              <span>As has seemingly become a yearly tradition in my gaming calendar, I have ended up finishing 2022 in much the same way I finished 2021: reviewing yet another Final Fantasy VII game. Last year, it was the PC release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this year it&#x27;s Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, a remaster of the original game&#x27;s PSP prequel. As such, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some &#x27;downtime&#x27; to &#x27;hang&#x27; with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. 
Drop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more.

                              <span>The universe that began with Horizon Zero Dawn is expanding, with devs Guerrilla Games confirming that they’re working on a new single-player games for Aloy, and a separate &quot;Online Project&quot; set in the same universe. Announced in a tweet today, it confirms previous rumours that Guerrilla were working on an online multiplayer Horizon game, and a recent batch of job listings for the project have given us a glimpse of what we might be able to expect once it&#x27;s ready.

                              <span>Two months after leaving early access, Vampire Survivors yesterday launched its first paid expansion. Its name is Legacy Of The Moonspell, and it adds a new map along with new characters and enemies and weapons, all inspired by Japanese folkore (including a variety of yokai and oni). For a mere £1.50, it is perfect. Do you like Vampire Survivors and want more? Buddy, it&#x27;s right here.

I&#x27;ll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;ll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going &quot;wheeee!&quot;.
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you&#x27;ll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you&#x27;ll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

                              <span>The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company&#x27;s long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it&#x27;s because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it&#x27;s been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

                              <span>When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren&#x27;t that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you&#x27;ll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I&#x27;ve concluded that my mind must&#x27;ve been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun&#x27;s verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you&#x27;ll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it&#x27;s a shame the FPS side can&#x27;t match it.

                              <span>Nothing beats the audio design of Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II. You know when you look at a light for too long and then close your eyes, and you see an imprint of the light against your retinas? The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not. As is the excellent &quot;EUURRYAAAARRGH!&quot; death-cry that protagonist Kyle Katarn makes as he takes one blaster bolt too many and collapses onto the ground.

It&#x27;s by developer Paul Schnepf, who made minimalist skateboarding game The Ramp and worked on the lovely yet much more goal-oriented Islanders. The Block is just about making something nice-lookin&#x27;. It&#x27;s out now, and cheap as chips.

                              <span>We all know that Hideo Kojima’s a big fan of the film industry, and that many of his games feature big Hollywood talent and have verged on movie-length cutscenes at times. I can’t say it’s a surprise, then, that Death Stranding, which just had its sequel confirmed at The Game Awards last week, is being adapted for film.

                              <span>Remember the Steam controller? It was kind of like the Neanderthal to the Steam Deck’s Homo sapiens, existing for a brief few years before being discontinued back in 2019. Steam Controllers were an unusual evolutionary offshoot of the by-then fairly standardised controller layout, with funky clickable trackpads taking the place of thumbsticks. Well, Valve’s designers seem to be up for reviving the concept in some form. At least, that’s what they’ve told The Verge in an interview about the Steam Deck’s first nine months.

Metzen had retired back in 2016 after decades of working on Warcraft and Blizzard’s other games. The return was shared by Warcraft general manager Jon Hight in a statement posted to Twitter, which confirmed that Metzen will initially return to the company to work on the long-running World Of Warcraft. It’s expected that Metzen will follow that up by moving onto other connected projects.

Hollywood Reporter say that Henry Cavill, recently-dropped Superman and former Geralt Of Rivia, is involved as an executive producer and potential series lead. The rights to Warhammer 40K are reportedly hotly contested among the rival streaming services, with Amazon spending months negotiating the possible deal with Games Workshop.

                              <span>It’s well documented that creativity can help quell the waves of stormy mental health seas. Hours of documentaries chronicle how artists expressed their struggles through brushstrokes, or how an actor agonised over creating an accurate character to counterbalance their imposter syndrome or anxiety.

That’s partly because it is now owned by Activision, but mostly because that was a long time ago, and most of the people who made the games you love have left.

How long did it take you to beat Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet? 20 hours? 30 hours? Well, the speedrunning community is here to put us to shame, as Automaton Media has spotted that the latest Pokémon games are being completed in under five and a half hours.
At the time of writing, the world record on Speedrun.com is held by Pokémon speedrunner truely, who has managed to beat the game in an impressive 5 hours, 27 minutes and 11 seconds. Okay, so that&#x27;s all three story paths, a decently levelled team of Pokémon, and plenty of other things we don&#x27;t want to spoil here, all wrapped up in an evening?

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo&#x27;s achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash&#x27;s exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Fortnite is crossing over with another big anime. This time, the saviors of My Hero Academia join the fight. Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.
Complete a total of four My Hero Academia Quests to earn the Deku’s Glove Emoticon.
Complete a total of eight My Hero Academia Quests to earn the U.A. Cape Back Bling.
Fortnite&#x27;s My Hero Academia event runs until December 29.</span>

Nedávno jsem narazil na ještě barevnější alternativu Btop++, která by se mohla někomu líbit. Btop++ je dílem Jakoba P. Liljenberga ze Švédska a je napsán v C++.

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled w…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel.

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

By doing so you could increase your Link-like character&#x27;s movement speed, change the behaviour of enemies, or - in the case of a puzzle that has taken 8 years to crack - discover secret rooms.

This is a deal on an 18TB hard drive from Amazon, a Seagate Exos X18 7200RPM CMR drive that will allow you to install all the games** or back up all the things**, or maybe both. This huge HDD has been reduced to £287, a historic low, which works out as 1.6p per gigabyte - absolutely crazy given the size we&#x27;re working with here. 
**Your mileage may vary, but if you are able to legitimately fill this I will be genuinely impressed.

                              <span>What better way to win back your community after the rocky launch of a new game than by providing a free &quot;upgrade&quot; to a beloved old game? I&#x27;ve no way of knowing if that&#x27;s what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month &quot;upgrading all copies&quot; of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC. 

If it was what they thought, it hasn&#x27;t worked. Players report that Re-Elected isn&#x27;t an upgrade at all, but that it has broken their save games, their mods, and introduced new launch and crash bugs to the nine-year-old game.

                              <span>It’s midseason update time for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and free to play battle royale Warzone 2, with the latter’s DMZ mode now letting you swap teams if things aren’t going so well. Been taken down in Warzone 2 but none of your squadmates are around to help? Or perhaps you’re just a bit fed up of waiting for them to revive you? Well, since the Season 01 Reloaded update arrived, you now have the option to ask enemy players for help and get to join their team if they do. There’s a whole bunch more stuff in the update including the new version of the Shipment map for Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, which you take a look at in the video below.

Across the five new missions of Art Vandals, she&#x27;s out to get revenge on an artist by raiding a modern art museum in a scenic seaside village. New crimes, new crimetools, and a new crimeplace?

There’s only a week and a bit to go before the day itself, and I’ve got all my decorations up and everything. I just haven’t found that festive groove. Cat-wrangling puzzler A Little To The Left has something in its Christmas sack that might spur on some kind of festive awakening though. Between December 22nd and 27th, A Little To The Left’s putting aside its Daily Tidy Delivery mode of randomly generated individual challenges to offer six holiday-themed messes for you to make spick and/or span. Cheers, Max Inferno.

The Hollywood Reporter, erm, reports that Wheel Of Time’s Rafe Judkins is showrunner on the project, backed up by writers and executive producers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Those two worked on The Expanse, and were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Children Of Men. No word on who will play the spartan goliath just yet, but the Clive Owen for Kratos campaign starts here.

It doesn&#x27;t have the fast pace and stunning climax of Solitaire, y&#x27;know? So what if we jazz it up by smashing in another puzzle game. Like in Minesweeper Tetris, released for free on Steam this morning, which kinda adds Tetris by making the screen slowly fill in with fresh lines of mines, challenging you to clear mines quickly. It twists my melon, man.

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below:

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

                              <span>Earlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.

                              <span>Yee haw, buckle up, root and also toot, for the Devil&#x27;s Moon event has kicked off in Hunt Showdown. The event sees Crytek&#x27;s excellent multiplayer cowboy sneak &#x27;em up periodically set fire to big parts of each map, where you blow up creepy bleedy statues for points that unlock new weapons and traits. There&#x27;s one that makes you invisible to monsters, which sounds ridiculously powerful - which is probably why the traits will only be in play until the event ends on January 15th.

Patch 9 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate III is out now, adding playable Paladins and increasing the level cap to 5. In true D&amp;D spirit, that&#x27;s when you get the good stuff, like the ability to fly or summon zombies. Heck, I think you can summon zombies and make *them* fly. It&#x27;s a whole new world.
Come watch the developers natter all about it in a festive edition of one of their Panels From Hell. One of them is dressed up as a knitting reindeer, and they just announced critical role chap Matthew Mercer will voice a new character.

                              <span>Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath&#x27;s exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you&#x27;ve dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite sad that one of The Geoff Awards 2022 announcements I&#x27;m most excited about likely targeted me and no-one else. And that&#x27;s because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn&#x27;t show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I&#x27;d argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn&#x27;t a life investment, and that&#x27;s rad.

                              <span>Earlier this year I watched a very short presentation of Inkbound, an upcoming turn-based roguelike from Shiny Shoe, the devs behind deckbuilder Monster Train. I thought it had potential, but it&#x27;s difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you&#x27;ve got to go on is footage they&#x27;d prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I&#x27;m excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe&#x27;s CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game&#x27;s speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

                              <span>Aquatic open-world sci-fi fest Subnautica has hit 2.0 with its Living Large major update, bringing the game&#x27;s quality up to par with sequel Subnautica: Below Zero. The update brings across some snazzy construction parts from Below Zero, meaning you’re now free to trick out your bases with surface hatches and glass domes. Nice. It also sweeps away more than 800 bugs, including ones that affected base building, vehicle navigation, and piloting. Living Large adds an unstuck button to the menu too, in case you get into peril on some geometry below the waves and can’t free yourself.

                              <span>Earlier today, it was revealed that Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion has a piece of artwork in it with a great big Getty Images watermark slapped across it. The eagle-eyed staff over at Kotaku posted an image of the offending painting, found in Nibelheim&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion where Zack and co find themselves toward the end of the game, and having gone back in to see for myself, I can confirm that, yep, the in-game painting of John Crowther&#x27;s Ludgate Circus, London, 1881 does indeed still have the watermark on it. Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a&#x27;knockin... 
Whoopsie artwork isn&#x27;t the only thing hiding in Crisis Core&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion, though, because down in the basement is a rather cute nod a Final Fantasy VII fav. Spoilers within, obvs.

The 7.2: Showdown On Ruhnuk update to saber-swinging MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic has you hunting down a rogue member of that pesky warrior clan, landing/crashing you on a new planet with fresh daily missions and a story questline. There&#x27;s a big PvP revamp, too, along with substantial changes to how gear works.
Planet Ruhnuk is the beigest entity I&#x27;ve ever seen, but you&#x27;re not there for your holidays, are you.

                              <span>We’re just a few weeks off living in the futuristic year of 2023, so it’s entirely unsurprising that the world’s (former) richest man just dropped the whole of Steam’s catalogue as a form of in-car entertainment. Elon Musk shared his company Tesla’s announcement, via his company Twitter, that not his company Steam was now supported in Tesla’s newest Model S and X vehicles. Do you remember when I-spy was the height of gaming in a car? Well, now you can pretty much play whatever game you like instead with the Tesla holiday update. You can use a controller, but it supports mouse and keyboard wirelessly for that authentic roadside PC experience.

                              <span>Today is the day The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s much touted free next-gen update arrives on PC and consoles, but it’s not been going so well for a lot of us folk on PC. People have already taken to Twitter, Reddit, and Steam with their tales of performance woe since the update landed, with Steam reviews claiming it&#x27;s caused everything from reduced frame rates to issues with the HUD. The RPS Treehouse has also been having trouble since installing the 4.0 update too, getting very inconsistent frame rates on the new max settings even with a RTX 3080 unless they turn off ray tracing and other new graphical features. Hardware editor James and vid bud Liam have more on The Witcher 3&#x27;s performance woes here, but for now, here&#x27;s how to avoid having the next-gen update ruin your Witcher 3 experience, and keep Roach running nice and smoothly.

                              <span>Cinema owners say that Avatar: The Way of the Water will hit Russian screens this Christmas, despite Western sanctions. Exactly when is unclear but with backing from the Association of Theater Owners, it seems almost inevitable. Meanwhile, a draft law presented to the government envisions movies such as Avatar 2 being distributed all around Russia, without their owners&#x27; permission.

                              <span>A Texas man who sold access to the pirate &#x27;Super Arab IPTV&#x27; service through Amazon and Walmart, is liable for more than $2 million in damages. The default judgment, requested by broadcaster Dish, also targets two Chinese companies. The court also issued a broad injunction that targets hosting providers, domain registries, and other IPTV sellers.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is a rather lovely PCIe 4.0 SSD, offering sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s at a surprisingly low price. The drive was dubbed &#x27;just short of SSD greatness&#x27; on its debut earlier this year, but price drops have brought it increasingly into contention. 
Today, for example, you can pick up the 1TB model from WD&#x27;s official UK web store for £75, down from £91, or the larger 2TB size for £140, down from £181. That beats the Amazon price considerably, especially for the 2TB size which is currently at £178.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of mechanical keyboards, so when I saw this unusual keyboard discounted on Amazon, I needed to write it up for RPS. The idea here is that it&#x27;s more or less a 60% size mechanical keyboard, but with two useful additions: arrow keys and a numpad. This makes it about the same size as a tenkeyless keyboard, but without the (lesser-used) navigation keys. 
Combined with an asking price of £42, down from a usual price of £50, I think it&#x27;s well worth considering - whether you&#x27;re looking for an interesting mechanical keyboard for your growing collection (I see you there) or a first cheap mech to give the whole idea a try.

                              <span>Games get delayed so often that it&#x27;s always a pleasure when a release date is instead moved earlier. Chop Goblins maybe takes it to an extra extreme. The 30-minute retro shooter from the developer of Dusk was due for release on January 2nd, but it&#x27;s out now after being released several weeks earlier. &quot;I was bored,&quot; explained the developer on Twitter.

                              <span>When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game&#x27;s most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn&#x27;t quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you&#x27;re mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they&#x27;ve done with FF7 Remake).
It&#x27;s with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7&#x27;s PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix&#x27;s ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I&#x27;ll say this. If you don&#x27;t already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that&#x27;s received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 struggled to quickly apply fixes for issues with its heroes during Season 1, but Blizzard say they’ve managed to sort all that out for the recently minted hero shooter. A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that&#x27;s not an observation, it&#x27;s an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.

                              <span>Today we reach day 13 of the RPS Advent Calendar. This is unlucky for some, but not for a group of cool, fast movin&#x27;, psyche-battlin&#x27; schoolkids, who spend a lot of time on extra curricular activities and not enough time getting their talking cat to shut up.

                              <span>It’s been 17 years and a week since Brokeback Mountain happened, and indie dev Robert Yang has taken the spirit of the movie and turned it into a free to play romance visual novel. That Lonesome Valley lets you play out the relationship between two young herders working alone together out in the American wilderness. Yang gives a content warning for the game, which contains pixel art nudity and sex sequences. You can watch the first ten minutes of That Lonesome Valley below.

                              <span>The strategic superheroics of Marvel’s Midnight Suns might make it a Bestest Bests winner, but tragically, it does come yoked to the dreadful 2K Launcher. A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns&#x27; stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you&#x27;re playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

That’s what devs Housemarque and publisher PlayStation have listed for Returnal’s recommended system requirements though. Shush, don’t tell anyone, but I don’t have that much RAM in my machine. Doing a straw poll of RPS staff, most of us don&#x27;t. Except James, who&#x27;s looking very pleased with himself right now.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

The lawsuit already lists 224 records but no trial is expected anytime soon, even if it gets that far. In the meantime, photos of the service&#x27;s servers and new details of the shutdown operation have appeared in a Federal Court order.

                              <span>Playing online card battlers can be a lonely life, so I was pleased to spot Marvel Snap&#x27;s latest community infographic. No longer are my opponents just names on a screen: they&#x27;re now names on a screen who I know have contributed to the 159 million Vibranium cards drawn during the Vibranium Forge event. It&#x27;s neat to see some silly stats, even neater to see a Black Panther with a power level that tops 8 million. A normal number would be, like, 16.

                              <span>You might have missed it in the Games Awards news-glut, but FromSoftware announced a new game last week. Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon&#x27;s Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they&#x27;re treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

A limited-time mode introduced with Season 01 Reloaded&#x27;s launch on Wednesday will see two teams of three knocking a big football about on ATVs equipped with special pulse abilities, in classic Rocket League fashion. 
The developers are also bringing back Mini Royale, popping up a new building in the DMZ mode, and adding a new map to the multiplayer mode that you actually need to own Modern Warfare 2 for.

Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has confirmed that more updates are on the way, using his Game Awards victory speech to announce that they&#x27;re working on &quot;several more things&quot; for Elden Ring. He also mentioned he plans to &quot;create even more interesting games&quot;, if a triumph like Elden Ring still isn&#x27;t good enough for you.

                              <span>Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent&#x27;s crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I&#x27;ve played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won&#x27;t pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

                              <span>The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX hark back to a simpler time – about three months ago – when graphics cards resembled graphics cards and not Coca-Cola lorries. I like getting a bajillion frames per second as much as the next PC owner, but good gravy, are the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 a pair of oversized, ruinously expensive brutes. AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

When it’s Unciv, a free to play, open-source reimagining of Sid Meier’s Civilization V that’s being developed by volunteers on GitHub. After nearly three years in development and releases on Android, Linux, and through itch.io, Unciv’s now moving its units onto Steam. You&#x27;ll be able to play multiplayer Unciv, but that involves using Dropbox for syncing, which isn’t free to use.

You can still unlock 70 of the things via Ubisoft Connect, which launches automatically when you boot the game up on Steam anyway - so the only functional difference is that your achievements won&#x27;t all be in the same place. People don&#x27;t love that, which is fair, but let&#x27;s keep our heads now.

CTV News report that parents of three Canadian children who regularly play Fortnite claim the game was created to be “highly addictive”, and allege the battle royale has caused their kids psychological and physical problems, along with financial issues. Although the families are seeking damages from Epic, no figure has been put on those yet. Epic has 30 days to appeal the case or it’ll go to trial.

Grindheim posted a video to YouTube and Twitter that alleged the publisher’s recent business practices towards the game haven’t been “ethically correct”. Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

                              <span>The RIAA booked a landmark victory against YouTube ripper Yout.com earlier this year. Soon after, the music group requested compensation for over $250,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees. Yout has now asked the court to put this matter on hold while its appeal over the legality of youtube-dl-based software is heard at the appeals court.

                              <span>Illegal streaming site PrimeWire avoided, dodged, or simply ignored Hollywood&#x27;s attempts to bring it down for at least a decade. A copyright lawsuit filed by the studios in 2021 was a clear sign that patience had finally run out and a year later, it&#x27;s all over. A California court has just awarded the plaintiffs $20.7m in damages plus $417,600 to cover attorneys&#x27; fees.

Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series.

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey.

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

This tweet (with a clip from cute Christmas romcom A Bride For Christmas, by the way, available on Amazon Prime) speaks to my current professional mindset. I&#x27;ve bought and wrapped all my presents, written and posted my cards, and now I can sit back and continue watching Christmas movies (37 since the start of November).

In the past, copyright infringement was the most cited reason for action but that has been replaced by &#x27;national security&#x27;, currently a top priority for Russia. Google, however, is wary of overbroad censorship and hasn&#x27;t complied with most requests.

ISPs must aim to block unlicensed streams immediately but certainly within 30 minutes. The proposal was signed by Senator Claudio Lotito, who happens to own top-tier football club Lazio and is currently the vice-president of Italy&#x27;s Budget Commission.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

                              <span>Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
