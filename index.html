My Hero Academia manga release schedule


Below, you’ll find a list of the next several chapters of the My Hero Academia manga series from now through the next few months. That said, we should note that these are based on patterns from previous releases, not all of the official, confirmed dates. 


It is entirely possible we could be wrong about a chapter or two, so keep that …</span>

                              <span>Focus Entertainment and Auroch Digital have announced that there’s a (paid) DLC expansion incoming for 2023’s Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. Forges of Corruption will feature new enemies, weapons, and environments, and it’s coming June 18, 2024 to PC and Consoles.


Warhammer 40K: Boltgun was pretty far off from being my favorite game of 2023. In particular, my biggest issue with it was its confusing and weak level design. However, it still left a big impact on me. Its weapon sound effects are incredible and being a big, stompy-legged war machine felt great. Despite all its problems, I still felt the need to recommend it.




In fact, I’m definitely interested in this DLC. Beyond giving the developers a chance at highlighting the gameplay with some (hopefully) better level design, I’m excited to see whatever new weapons get thrown our way. To be specific, they’re adding the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher. Boltgun didn’t have a missile launcher already? I can’t remember. I suppose the eponymous Boltgun is technically a rocket launcher already, as explained to me by a reader.


The Forges of Corruption campaign will take us back to Graia, which is a bit of a shame since I’d rather see something that isn’t just one big industrial planet. The new enemies you’ll be facing are the Helbrute and the Terminator.


On top of but separate from the upcoming DLC, Auroch Digital is also adding a horde mode. A staple of the modern FPS, horde mode has you facing off against endless waves of enemies. The horde mode will be free to all players, whether they purchase the DLC or not.


Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Forges of Corruption releases on June 18, 2024.

                              <span>Hellblade 2 is almost entirely a linear experience. Barring some slight changes in how you tackle combat or how quickly you solve puzzles, each player gets from point A to point B in the same way.  That is, except for one specific moment near the end of the game. Here&#x27;s whether you should help Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2.


Should you go with Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2?


This choice appears when proceeding through the Jarnvior forest near the end of Hellblade 2. As you progress, you&#x27;ll link back up with your companions who are experiencing their deepest fears come to life. Senua partially helps both Fargrimr and Astridr with their issues, but then comes upon a crossroads where she must choose who to help. The one who&#x27;s lost his way, or the one who fears what can&#x27;t die by the blade.


While this may seem like a big choice, who you choose here doesn&#x27;t affect the main story in any meaningful way. You&#x27;ll help one of them navigate the forest for a few moments before finding the other down the path, shaken up but no worse for wear. After meeting up with Thorgestr, the story proceeds as if the choice never came up.


While it is a little sad that neither choice matters, it&#x27;s likely Ninja Theory just wanted to test your thoughts on who you&#x27;d help in that situation more than making you decide who lives or dies. If you had to choose between someone who could no longer fight for themselves and someone who could no longer see the path forward, who would you choose to save?

                              <span>Tokyo Ghoul is one of the most popular manga and anime series of all time. Those who want to hop into the original source material will find there are a few different manga series that make up the franchise. Fortunately, the human-consuming ghouls&#x27; story is pretty easy to get into, unlike a lot of other manga. Here’s how to read Tokyo Ghoul in order. 


How to read Tokyo Ghoul in order


The Tokyo Ghoul manga series is a lengthy one, with three separate manga series in total to check out. While one of them is a spin-off and not too long, the other two are lengthy, with more than a dozen volumes each to read. While this might seem overwhelming in terms of length, there is a pretty straightforward reading order you should know about.

Unlike its partner campaign, the Free to Play Campaign, this one is designed to entice players back into Eorzea if they haven’t paid their sub in a while or are unsure whether they’re ready to commit again. The campaign gives players 96 hours of playtime, as long as they’ve met the eligibility requirements:



Must have purchased and registered Final Fantasy XIV 


All characters associated with the account must have been inactive for at least 30 days



If you meet these criteria, then you’re in luck. Between May 23 and June…</span>

Sand Grease Pupa locations and farming route


Sand Grease Pupae can be found in the northern part of the Sumeru desert, where the landscape swirls into a large spiraling formation with a sandstorm at its center. They look like gray egg-shaped objects partially buried in the sand. Having Tighnari in your party will mark their locations on your minimap, and Nahida can gather them from afar using her hold Skill.

                              <span>Wuthering Waves&#x27; treasure chests feature all kinds of puzzles for unlocking them, from peculiar training dummy pillars to moving around mysterious repeaters to activate light block mechanisms. The Encryption Block puzzle is an example, requiring you to unlock a specific ability.


How to solve Encryption Block chest puzzles in Wuthering Waves


Solving the Encryption Block puzzle requires using the Levitator ability to move the Key Repeater pillars onto the blocks surrounding the treasure chest. Doing this causes the blocks to light up, and your objective is to get every block to emit light. Once each Encryption Block emits light, the chest will unlock, allowing you to claim its rewards.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re looking at an Encryption Block puzzle when you see spiked pillars and chiseled stone panels on the ground surrounding a locked chest. Unlike other puzzles, you can levitate the pillars and move them onto the blocks, allowing you to see which panels will emit light when you place the pillar. 


Once you place each pillar on the Encryption Blocks, you&#x27;ll unlock the chest and claim its reward. Typically, locked treasure chest rewards include Astrite, EXP potions, or character ascension materials. 


How to unlock the Levitator ability


If you encounter one of these puzzles before unlocking levitation, you&#x27;ll first have to progress far enough into the main story to visit the Jinzhou city hall. Here, you&#x27;ll meet with Sanhua and learn more about your current situation before venturing off to the next area. Before leaving, though, Sanhua will provide you with multiple character abilities, including levitation.

                              <span>Almost every combat-heavy game offers controller support, allowing players to maneuver around the battlefield easily. However, you may have stumbled upon a roadblock in Wuthering Waves, where the feature may not be available. We&#x27;re here to show you how to play on a controller in Wuthering Waves, including what devices are supported. 


Wuthering Waves controller gameplay, explained 


As of now, Wuthering Waves only supports controllers on PCs, not on mobile devices. I&#x27;ve tried it on Android to no avail, producing a mouse cursor on the phone screen with no inputs. iOS users have said the same thing, so PC controller support is the only way to go. 


Supported controllers for Wuthering Waves


Wuthering Waves is compatible with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One controllers. Although I&#x27;ve heard some reports about PS4 controllers not being compatible, it did work for me. All you need to do is simply plug it into your PC to begin playing Wuthering Waves this way. 


If you prefer to connect via Bluetooth, you can do so by turning on your controller&#x27;s Bluetooth mode and then searching for it in your PC&#x27;s Bluetooth settings. Once connected, the game will recognize the controller and switch to controller mode. 


Head to Settings and select the Keys tab. You can tweak button inputs from here, including locking on a target, dash/dodge, and Resonance Skill.

It isn&#x27;t clear when controller support will be available for mobile, so you may want to stick with PC in the meantime. Kuro Game Studio has indicated that they are working on a gamepad feature, but it looks like it won&#x27;t be entirely available for all platforms on launch.

Character Ascension materials for Alhaitham


Pseudo-Stamens - Setekh Wenut


Alhaitham’s world boss is the Setekh Wenut in the Sumeru desert. To defeat the Wenut, wait for it to fly into the air and summon orbs of Anemo energy. Hit two of the orbs with Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo to stun the Wenut and lower its RES to the element you chose. It helps to bring a Bow user of your chosen element.


Alhaitham requires Perpetual Calibers to Ascend to level 90. You’ll need to challenge the Setekh Wenut about 18 times, spending about 720 Resin at World Level 8.

That&#x27;s bound to change as the game is updated, of course, and Patch 2 is proof enough of that.


Notably, No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s Early Access Patch 2 is the biggest update the game&#x27;s received yet. Sure, it is only the second major update Wicked has gotten so far, but I&#x27;ll allow it. It&#x27;s a sizeable chunk of improvements across the board, for sure: between performance uplifts, control scheme improvements, all-new gameplay features, and a variety of fixes and balancing boons, there&#x27;s a lot to like here.

It doesn’t matter how long it takes me or how many things I rub on other things to try and make progress. I eventually solve the case and outsmart a game designed for me to outsmart.


Duck Detective: The Secret Salami promised this in a healthy, low-calorie bite. Of its bullet points, it proudly states that it’s 2-3 hours long. I can handle that. I’m often conscious for at least 2-3 hours a day. That, like, half a Tangle Tower!

                              <span>If you fancy getting up close and personal with your opponents in XDefiant, then the P90 SMG could be the weapon for you. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve put together the best loadout and attachments to give you an advantage over your opponents. 


Of course, no loadout we can give you will automatically make you a good player, but it can help you hit your shots and deal the most damage possible. With XDefiant&#x27;s faction system, there&#x27;s no need to worry about Lethals or Tacticals like there are in Call of Duty, making the process a lot easier.

                              <span>As previously alluded to, Activision plans to reveal the next Call of Duty during an exclusive event. Here is everything you need to know about the Black Ops: 6 Direct. 


Following a series of teaser videos, Activision officially revealed a logo and title for the next Call of Duty series installment, Black Ops 6. Treyarch was confirmed to develop the upcoming title alongside Raven Software. Previously, the two studios collaborated on the Black Ops: Cold War campaign in 2020, which was the most recent Treyarch-led title. Four years is the longest any Call of Duty developer has had to work on a project, and anticipation is already high after the first batch of marketing.

As for what fans should expect from the reveal event, Activision confirmed that there will be an in-depth look at gameplay and product announcements. Based on what we know, the next Call of Duty will reportedly be set in the Gulf War, “with a strong focus on the CIA,” according to Insider Gaming, and Rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October.

What color of Yoshi you get depends on the amount of time that it stays in its egg. There are seven color possibilities. But let’s first look at how to get the baby Yoshi. Just scroll down to the chart if that’s what you’re looking for.

Helldivers 2, however, is practically speedrunning in this respect. Thankfully, things are slowly settling down now that the former CEO, Johan Pilestedt, is back in action.


More specifically, after the review bombing of Helldivers 2 and the game&#x27;s questionable balancing updates, the former CEO decided it was time for him to give up the business side of things and refocus on the game itself. Thus, Pilestedt stepped down from his position of CEO to step into the shoes of Helldivers 2&#x27;s chief creative officer and chairman. Unsurprisingly, Pilestedt already has some promising ideas on where to take Helldivers 2 next, and many of them stem from the game&#x27;s time-to-kil…</span>

Straynus is bringing Cronela&#x27;s Mansion to Kickstarter and offering a slew of possible rewards for backers who pledge their financial support. Among these rewards are physical versions of the game for the SNES and Game Boy that will run on each piece of hardware, provided you own one. However, they&#x27;re Kickstarter exclusive, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to pick one up after the campaign has ended in summer 2024.

How to unlock Levitator in Wuthering Waves


Unlocking the levitator ability requires progressing through the main story until you initially reach Jinzhou&#x27;s city hall and meet Sanhua. After some brief discussions, you&#x27;ll unlock several new abilities, many of which you&#x27;ll discover as you continue through the main story missions following directly after.

                              <span>Waveplate is hands-down the most important part of the early game in Wuthering Waves, but it is also super easy to mess up and waste it. 


You will really want to know as much as you can about Waveplate in order to take full advantage of it and get your hands on the best resource for the early game. In this guide, I&#x27;ll tell you everything you need to know.


How to get more Waveplate in Wuthering Waves


To get Waveplate, you just need to let it recharge. It will do so at a rate of one Waveplate per six minutes. This means that for every hour, you earn ten Waveplate. The currency has a limit of 240 that can be held at any one time, which means if you are at zero, then within 24 hours, you will be maxed out and will need to spend some to take advantage of the recharge rate.

Understanding these abilities is crucial for enhancing your gameplay, so let&#x27;s delve into the best XDefiant Factions for each mode.


Which Factions should you use with each mode in XDefiant?


There are five modes players can dive into in XDefiant: Escort, Zone Control, Domination, Occupy, and Hot Shot. Depending on the game mode, specific Factions will work better, so we&#x27;ll break each one down. 


Escort

Echelon


Phantoms



If you&#x27;ve landed on or chosen Escort, it&#x27;s best to go with high-defense Factions like Phantoms. Their protective abilities, such as the Blitz Shield and Ultra Aegis, are tailor-made for fendin…</span>

                              <span>After months of speculation and hype, we finally know that the 2024 edition of Call of Duty will be titled Black Ops 6, and we&#x27;ve just gotten our first look at the game&#x27;s logo. 


In a post from the official Call of Duty account on X, Activision and Treyarch stated that Black Ops 6 would be a &quot;dark new chapter&quot; for the franchise. 


The logo is a classic Black Ops logo, with the number six at the end in the series&#x27; iconic orange color. Above, the three-headed Cerberus on a shield is also present, first seen in the teaser for the June 9 showcase. 




The logo reveal followed an image leaked from a worker at a news press, where Activision has allegedly been printing wraps for USA Today, which includes an image of the Presidents featured on Mount Rushmore with their eyes covered by blindfolds, with the words &quot;The Truth Lies&quot; painted on them. 




The wrap also features a link to thetruthlies.com, which was the first BO6 teaser we got for the game on Wednesday, May 24. With the TV on that site only going up to six channels, many took this as a hint that Black Ops 6 would be the name, but we now know that&#x27;s the case. 


There had been some confusion around the naming of Treyarch&#x27;s next CoD title, considering that the last one, which should have been Black Ops 5, was titled Black Ops Cold War. As hype grew throughout 2024, some suggested it would be titled Black Ops Gulf War, but appears Treyarch has reverted to the number system. 


Black Ops 6 is penciled in for an Autumn release, with many suspecting an October launch for the next Call of Duty blockbuster.

Let grandma tell you a story (this is actually before my time, as well, whippersnapper.) While it’s generally remembered that the Atari 2600 dominated the early days of consoles, it wasn’t the only one on the market (or the first). During its heyday, it went up against a few competing consoles like the Fairchild Channel F and Magnavox Odyssey 2. But none came closer to threatening its dominance like Mattel’s Intellivision. Things were looking good for Mattel Electronics when the bottom fell out of the video game market in the Crash of 1983. Things were so dire t…</span>

                              <span>Strange Horticulture&#x27;s developer Bad Viking has today announced a follow-up to its occult plant investigation and puzzle title: Strange Antiquities. The sequel is set in the same location of Undermere but explores the arcane artifacts, which puts you in a position where you&#x27;ll be meeting those interested in acquiring them. 


In Stange Antiquities, you&#x27;ll take on the role of an antique store owner. Running the business requires you to interact with all sorts of characters from Undermere and help them solve their fairly unique problems through the use of arcane artifacts. Along the way, there are mysteries and puzzles to be solved that will see you dive deeper into the town&#x27;s murky lore. 


Strange Antiquities is a dark and cozy adventure that welcomes players into its mysteries

                              <span>Chapter 6 is my absolute favorite part of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Turn-based combat can start to feel dull after 30-or-so hours, so when the game suddenly turns into an adventure-style investigation, it’s a welcome reprieve. However, you might get stuck trying to find a blanket in that chapter and want to get back to the turn-based combat. Here’s where to find it.


Chapter 6 has you riding on the Excess Express, and a large chunk of the beginning has you merely solving mysteries. These can get a bit obtuse, and where to find the blanket is the absolute peak of cryptic.


The Excess Express isn’t very big, so your best course of action at the start of each mystery is to talk to everyone you can. If you talk to the toad who is constantly holding a fork and knife, he’ll tell you…</span>

                              <span>There are lots of side quests in Wuthering Waves, and because you are likely to run into the Hero of the Leap quest at a random point, you might be very, very confused as you try to complete it. 


One of the steps in the quest is to use the sensor to find the optimal route, but you might not even have the sensor yet. If this has happened to you, I can help you out.


How to use the sensor for the optimal route in Wuthering Waves


You can find the Hero of the Leap quest in the center of Jinzhou. A young man by the name of Dashbon can be found near the pools in the town, and he will tell you about great heroes who used to jump from roof to roof in the city. He will then give you the chance to follow in their footsteps and take on the Overdash challenge.

                              <span>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone&#x27;s mind is likely Xbox&#x27;s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
&quot;This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,&quot; chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
&quot;Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,&quot; CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. &quot;We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.&quot;
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari&#x27;s outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.</span>

                              <span>In an interview with his parent company on Sony.com, Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann talks about AI and briefly teases Naughty Dog&#x27;s next game. Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog&#x27;s next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.&quot;
The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, &quot;AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we&#x27;re reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.&quot;
He also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show&#x27;s second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.

                              <span>When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a &quot;beloved&quot; series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it&#x27;s a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn&#x27;t a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game&#x27;s campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, &quot;The truth lies,&quot; while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

                              <span>Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

With official word that a Nintendo Switch &quot;successor&quot; will be announced before April 2025, there&#x27;s really no debating that Switch is in the twilight of its years. We&#x27;re well into Year 8 now, and we&#x27;re being served up a series of remakes and remasters of old favourites while Nintendo&#x27;s premier teams focus on brand-new games for the brand-new system.
First-party-wise, in the last six months we&#x27;ve had Super Mario RPG, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and the Nintendo-published Another Code: Recollection — and we also got Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, Advance Wars 1+2, and Metroid Prime Remastered last year. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is launching today, with Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD arriving next month. If you&#x27;re a sucker for new versions of old classics, you&#x27;ve been like a pig in mud on Switch and elsewhere over the last couple of years.

                              <span>But that&#x27;s one shell of a price tag.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is coming to the Switch later on this year. We don&#x27;t know exactly when and we don&#x27;t know exactly what it will look like, but we do know that it will have a physical Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Edition. So that&#x27;s something.
Today, Outright Games has revealed a first look at these physical copies and, fortunately, they both look &#x27;totally bodacious&#x27; (as four Renaissance artists once said).

Medallion Games and Super Rare Originals have today announced that Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines (a sequel to 2022&#x27;s Grapple Dog, in case you were wondering) will be swinging onto Switch on 15th August.
Much like its predecessor, Cosmic Canines looks full to the brim with GBA-style pixel art joy. This time around, all-around good boy Pablo is joined by a new puppy pal, Luna — an explosive gunslinger who will seemingly bring a little more combat to the platforming mix.

It&#x27;s time to take a look at the weekly Japanese charts from Famitsu (by way of Gematsu) and it&#x27;s a rather quiet one this time, folks.
The PS5&#x27;s Stellar Blade holds onto the crown for the third week in a row (though Paper Mario will surely shake things up next time) and Ring Fit Adventure has clearly been doing its stretches as it has leapt up into second.

                              <span>&quot;Life is path of choices, I made the wrong one&quot;.
Gary Bowser, the infamous figure who was convicted for his role with Team Xecuter in facilitating piracy of Nintendo games, has recently spoken to UNILAD to state that he sees his arrest and subsequent conviction as &quot;a blessing&quot;.
Alongside serving 14 of his 30-month prison sentence, Bowser was required to pay $10 million directly to Nintendo in restitution in addition to a $4.5 million fine. As such, he struck a deal with Nintendo in which 20-30% of his surplus income would go to the company, meaning that he will likely be in significant debt for many years to come.

Atari has announced that it has acquired the Intellivision brand along with the rights to over 200 games in a move that, according to Digital Eclipse&#x27;s studio head Mike Mika, &quot;ends the longest-running console war in history&quot;.
As a result, Intellivision Entertainment LLC will rebrand and will continue its work on developing and distributing the Amico brand game console (Atari keenly dodged that one). Atari, meanwhile, will license out new versions of the Intellivision games for the Amico.

You don’t get ‘lucky’ in Wizardry, not like you can do in other games. You might run into an easy enemy once in a while, but if you decide to take a chance during an expedition and descend a floor ‘just to see’ how it goes, it will not go well. &quot;Your entire party has been slaughtered.&quot; Again. This remake of Sir-Tech&#x27;s formative 1981 dungeon crawler may have had a few rough edges sanded off by Digital Eclipse, but underneath the finery this is the same game that has been wiping your parties for over four decades. There&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;winging it&#x27; in Wizardry.
The remake opens with a letter from the &#x27;Project Murphy&#x27; team explaining its aims. &quot;Our primary goal is to make the original game accessible to modern players while remaining faithful to the original feel and gameplay.&quot; For better or worse, what we have here is a very faithful adaptation that retains the spirit of the Apple II original. And it&#x27;s a fine — and punishing — piece of work that might benefit from a couple more optional enhancements.

The last remaining player to play Pokémon X &amp; Y via the Nintendo 3DS online servers has shared a message of thanks after surviving for 28 days, 23 hours, and 30 minutes after the official shutdown.
Known only as &#x27;Amanda&#x27;, the player&#x27;s message was relayed online by Joziken (one of the &#x27;Elite Four&#x27; of the Nintendo Network) via X (thanks, GamesRadar). She stated &quot;I just wanted to say thank you to all those who were rooting for me over the past month as I held on to remain online, I never thought I&#x27;d end up being the final Pokemon player on the Nintendo Network, but it happened anyway.&quot;

Dataminers have uncovered references to higher-resolution output in the code for the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Switch remake.
As posted by @RibShark (thanks @NintyPrime), the game apparently contains code designed to handle rendering at a variety of resolutions, including 4K, which the current Switch doesn&#x27;t support.

Since the final update for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate earlier this year, Nintendo has been restocking the game&#x27;s amiibo.
With this in mind, the my Nintendo Store in the US has apparently had another big restock, and this time you can even get your hands on the Mii Fighters and Pokémon Trainer. Up until now, these were supposedly some of the &quot;rarest&quot; Smash Bros. amiibo.

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

                              <span>In Anthology of the Killer you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific creator Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

                              <span>Sometimes you gotta know when to fold, and trying to get new hotness RPG Wuthering Waves to play nice with the Steam Deck has got me creasing like an origami crane. While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

                              <span>A decision by Italy&#x27;s Council of State, overruling the decision of a lower court that Google couldn&#x27;t be held liable for displaying locally illegal advertising, is being welcomed by the head of telecoms regulator AGCOM. Massimiliano Capitanio notes that Google&#x27;s defense failed the moment it became more than a passive host. &quot;The same line should be adopted to eradicate piracy,&quot; Capitanio says.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre. You are a bespectacled woman carrying a clutch who walks with incredible poise into a mansion with little understanding of why you are there or what you are doing. The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood. You may not know why you are petting the dog in the courtyard, checking every door, or reading every scrap of paper you come across initially, but you want to be there and see everything the game has to offer. And i…</span>

                              <span>We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show&#x27;s finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri).

                              <span>Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game&#x27;s recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

Fans of the Netflix series The Witcher were understandably up in arms when leading star Henry Cavill announced his departure only to be replaced by Liam Hemsworth.
Alas, it&#x27;s happening, but judging from the newly-released &#x27;first look&#x27; teaser for the upcoming season, our confidence in Hemsworth has been given a slight boost. Granted, we don&#x27;t see his version of Geralt of Rivia do anything other than turn to the camera in a suitably brooding and manacing manner, but it&#x27;s a start.

We first caught wind of Capes in the hazy days of early 2023. The turn-based superhero tactics set-up sounded like a novel idea, albeit one that we were worried might tread on the toes of one Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns which, remember, we were still expecting to see on Switch.
That Switch port was eventually cancelled, and we Nintendo fans were left with an &#x27;XCOM-meets-X-Men&#x27; gap in our game libraries. Almost one year on, Capes is set to fly into that gap.

A reliable insider by the name of みどり (Midori) has stated on X that they have heard that the upcoming Kingdom Hearts 4, along with the entire Kingdom Hearts series so far, might be heading to Nintendo&#x27;s next hardware (a.k.a. the &#x27;Switch 2&#x27;).
Midori states &quot;In February, someone sent me a message about Missing Link, KH4 and the Steam ports but I did not know the source at the time&quot;. The source also told them about the Kingdom Hearts series&#x27; Steam release, which had not been announced then but has since been confirmed.

We are so close to the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch that we can almost smell it (gross). The highly-anticipated GameCube RPG unfolds on the Nintendo hybrid tomorrow, 23rd May, and we have already heard what the critics make of it — spoiler: we loved it.
Just before release, however, the experts over at Digital Foundry have swept in to provide a technical rundown so we all know what to expect from the remake as far as performance and resolution are concerned.

It feels like Donkey Kong is everywhere at the moment. With the lovable ape’s significant appearance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the upcoming DK-themed expansion at Japan’s Super Nintendo World, and the safe, but enjoyable Mario vs. Donkey Kong Switch remake, you could say we’re in the midst of a Kong-aissance reawa-Kong-ing revitalisat-Kong... a return for DK. But something’s missing, right?
Yes, despite Nintendo’s renewed focus on Mario’s former nemesis, we’ve still yet to see the very thing that fans have been clamouring for since the 2014 release of Tropical Freeze: a brand-new Donkey Kong game. Of course, recent details surrounding the cancelled ‘Freedom’ project at Vicarious Visions have exacerbated an already-agonising wait, but it nevertheless feels like something might well be cooking within Nintendo’s iron-clad fortress.

                              <span>Turn the Paige.
Though plenty of Paper Mario fans are eagerly awaiting the return of one of the greatest games in the series at the time of writing, there’s another new game set in a papery world that we’d suggest you pay attention to. Newfangled Games’ Paper Trail is the debut release of the boutique London-based studio, and its smart mixture of creative puzzle design with gorgeous storybook visuals makes for a compelling puzzle experience. Paper Trail is a pretty simple game at heart, but it’s so fresh in its ideas and execution that it’ll stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.
Paper Trail places you in the role of Paige, an intelligent girl living with her family in a quiet seaside village who has aspirations of going to school to become an astrophysicist. Her parents oppose her choice to go to college, however, leading to Paige running away from her family and home towards her goals. Along the way, she uses her ability to change reality to help strangers she encounters, who in turn provide her with companionship as she gets farther away from home. It’s a pretty simple premise, but it’s helped greatly by the voiced ‘journal entries’ as you travel between worlds, which also help flesh out Paige’s tragic backstory and motivations for choosing her vocation. It’s not exactly a ‘deep’ narrative, but it draws you in and lulls you into a sense of ease with its soft magical realism.

The Pokémon Company International has announced that its line of soda pop plushies, once exclusive to Japan, are now launching in the West for the first time.
Designed via a collaboration with Japanese illustrator and graphic designer F*Kaori, the first three plushies are based on the original starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Available to order now for £16.99 / $19.99 a pop, each plush measues in at just over 6 inches in height (well, about 5.5 inches for Bulbasaur).

                              <span>The classic anime series Gundam examines the traumatic experience of war, particularly the unalterable effect it has on those young soldiers forced to participate in the horrors of fighting for their life while taking the lives of others using weapons of inhuman strength and devastation. Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

                              <span>In a twist of fate I&#x27;ve mentioned in some recent Destiny 2 news posts, I am fully back into Destiny. Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.

                              <span>Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you&#x27;re dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

                              <span>At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name &quot;Alice&quot; you don&#x27;t just say &quot;oh hi&quot; like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, &quot;Alice&quot;. An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

                              <span>We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You&#x27;re likely confused, and that&#x27;s understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

However, the anti-piracy coalition officially reports just a tiny minority. During Monday and over the weekend, a batch of pirate IPTV domains came under ACE/MPA control adding to the flood of domains already commandeered in 2024.

                              <span>In 1993, the original NBA Jam hit arcades and revolutionized the arcade sports genre. High-flying dunks, flaming basketballs, and the biggest names from the hardwood served as trademarks for the classic quarter-munching cabinet. Though the series has been absent for years now, with the last entry arriving in 2011 under the EA Sports umbrella, Play Mechanix and Raw Thrills have partnered with the NBA and the NBA Players Association to bring that same arcade-style basketball action to arcades with NBA Superstars.
NBA Superstars brings 3v3 arcade-style basketball action, featuring all 30 teams consisting of 120 of the biggest stars in the NBA. Players can take the court as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more in the first NBA-br…</span>

This new version of what&#x27;s arguably Kingdom Hearts’ de facto theme song is part of Utada’s greatest hits album, Science Fiction, which was released last month and features multiple re-recordings of their hit songs. Last month, Utada released the re-recorded version of “Hikaru”, the Japanese version of “Simple and Clean”.

                              <span>The latest trailer for the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC focuses on how the add-on will fit into the story of Elden Ring. The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.


Elden Ring&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99. A physical collector&#x27;s Edition of the DLC package will also be available for $249.99 and will include a statue.

                              <span>Square Enix has announced that several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month. Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.
On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC
Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)
If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts: Re:Coded (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-
Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover (movie)
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind
Kingdom Hearts III
Re Mind DLC
This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.</span>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…</span>

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t need a sequel. It had a clear story to tell, and it told it well with an artful (and tactful) execution of its mental health themes and a strong conclusion. But Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II builds a great case for itself by using the titular warrior’s growth to help not only herself but, for the first time, others around her, shining her in a fascinating new light. Refined gameplay and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing.
Since the first game’s conclusion, Senua’s …</span>

                              <span>Over the past several years we have seen AMD Ryzen processors being used for low-cost servers, budget web hosting platforms, game servers, and more. Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel&#x27;s current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.</span>

Verze 1.8.0 přináší řadu novinek ve všech oblastech, mimo jiné s ní jde muxovat VP9 a FLAC v rámci kontejneru MP4. V oblasti videa přibyla podpora kodéru FFV1 (včetně profilu „Preservation FFV1“), podporu s konstantní kvalitou u víceprůchodového kódování VP9. V kodéru SVT-AV1 je podporováno předávání dynamických metadat HDR formátu Dolby Vision. Zrychluje filtr decomb.</span>

                              <span>I could pretend I understand Square Enix&#x27;s action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don&#x27;t need to, &#x27;cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don&#x27;t properly understand it), wasn&#x27;t on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn&#x27;t watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

That&#x27;s why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there&#x27;s a new map, too.

But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. &quot;[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead,&quot; said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, &quot;rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.&quot;

                              <span>The original Undermine released in 2020 and was an unexpected rogue hit that felt like it came out of nowhere.

It&#x27;s the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017&#x27;s Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game&#x27;s opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

                              <span>Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th&#x27;s Jason Voorhees and The Matrix&#x27;s Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>Larian Studios, the team behind last year&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher&#x27;s seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
&quot;With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland&#x27;s lively gaming scene,&quot; the company&#x27;s announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don&#x27;t expect a sequel to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian&#x27;s CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur&#x27;s Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
&quot;Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.&quot;

                              <span>Internet provider WOW has asked a Colorado federal court to dismiss an expanded piracy liability complaint filed by several film companies earlier this year. The ISP says there is no evidence to show that it received any piracy notices for the 300 new works added to the lawsuit. In addition, it believes that recent court verdicts support a dismissal of at least some of the claims in the multimillion dollar lawsuit.

It sounds like that release is still a ways off, according to a recent update from Fox, even as the latest chapter seemingly makes “great progress” and the team eye up work on Chapter 5.

They’re also thinking about a sequel - probably not much of a surprise given the first game has sold well on just the one platform, by all accounts - while working on a new game that should also be headed to PC, codenamed Project Witches.

But there&#x27;s more of it, and although after much reflection I think it&#x27;s not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

                              <span>Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

                              <span>You remember the ending of 2011&#x27;s first-person bullethoser Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, right? Everyone does! A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

This is RPG outfit Larian’s seventh studio worldwide, and the latest to contribute to their &quot;24-hour development cycle&quot; model. That’s even more hands on deck to a) keep Swen Vincke’s armour polished to a fine sheen and b) ensure smooth sailing for the two new games that Larian currently have in the works.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it&#x27;s time for Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic&#x27;s review* incredibly annoying?

This is going to be another one of those, isn’t it?.’ Truly, language’s many permutations are a font of limitless wonder. This week, it’s Pony Island, The Hex, and Inscryption maker Daniel Mullins! Cheers Daniel! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

                              <span>The next Call Of Duty will arrive on Game Pass on day one, according to anonymous sources. Microsoft&#x27;s strategy has long involved releasing all their first-party games on Game Pass, but there had been doubt over whether the same would be true of the first Call Of Duty to be released since Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of publishers Activision.

My brand new fancy shmancy ottoman bed is arriving in my new flat, after two weeks of curling up on the sofa with a weighted blanket.

To imagine there&#x27;ll be any time for games! Pah!

Even Alice, who has routinely told me that actually there are no good games. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll be clicking on this weekend.

By going private and processing takedown notices, the site&#x27;s operators hope to shake off their copyright troubles, at least as far as that&#x27;s possible.

                              <span>Japan-based publisher Shueisha is maintaining the pressure on sites distributing vast quantities of pirated manga content. A DMCA subpoena obtained at a United States court reveals around two dozen targets, some with relatively low traffic but many enjoying millions of visits per month. One stand out platform is currently ranked the 14th most popular site in Vietnam, period.

                              <span>Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It&#x27;s not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year&#x27;s highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s 2 reads, &quot;Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.&quot; The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won&#x27;t be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn&#x27;t died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite&#x27;s official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon

May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there&#x27;s not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite&#x27;s current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it&#x27;s anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it&#x27;s unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.

                              <span>Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery. 

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.</span>

But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it&#x27;s still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We&#x27;re very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year&#x27;s Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
&quot;Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,&quot; the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we&#x27;ll see what happens. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

                              <span>2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K&#x27;s biggest franchises are prime for a new game. 
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That&#x27;s less than a month away so we don&#x27;t have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.

While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. 
The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you&#x27;re looking for something to play through in that universe. 
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. 
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It&#x27;s been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here&#x27;s what we want in a BioShock 4. 
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer&#x27;s summer gaming showcase schedule.

Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.

Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero shooter with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of Overwatch, Dota 2 and Valve’s own Team Fortress 2.

                              <span>I love building games, but it&#x27;s not that often that put one down and feel particularly tempted to get straight back into it again. Of Life And Land is one of those, but thankfully not so much so that it threatens to consume my every waking moment.
It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it&#x27;s lovely.

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

                              <span>“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

I bring it up because, as is often your way, the readership commented me into thinking about something I’ve been wanting to cover: the outdated relic that is the easy/normal/hard difficulty trifecta. &quot;Ohoho,&quot; I warbled chuckilishly. &quot;I shall craft a blistering manifesto, sharper than the apex of a Toblerone on the roof of your mouth when you try to eat it as god intended. I will solve this problem.&quot; And then I thought, &quot;Actually, no. That sounds hard.&quot; So, instead, here are some wazzock-tier ramblings.

                              <span>Creative Assembly, the studio best known for their strategy Total War series, are rumoured to be working on a licensed Star Wars title. ‘Rumoured’ is the key word here, mind. Dualshockers credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.

                              <span>You might remember Enotria: The Last Song as the Italian-inspired Soulslike that shifted its release date from June to August to avoid Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree... but found itself nestled next to Black Myth: Wukong. Well, scratch that August release, as now it&#x27;s been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there&#x27;s a demo coming out real soon that&#x27;ll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game&#x27;s like. I imagine it&#x27;ll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they&#x27;ve decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls&#x27; bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man&#x27;s stats were specced high.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare&#x27;s big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I&#x27;m particularly proud of. I&#x27;m not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there&#x27;s a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It&#x27;s a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it&#x27;s very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there&#x27;s at least one item on there I&#x27;d push back on, but also this isn&#x27;t really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

But “Fall”, despite not being a real season, is something I can work with.

This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night&#x27;s work. There is a catch though.

                              <span>Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the Principality of Sealand, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto VI&#x27;s reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise&#x27;s parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two&#x27;s recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).</span>

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director&#x27;s Cut, is out on PC today. It&#x27;s a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve&#x27;s handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It&#x27;s not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that&#x27;s your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

                              <span>Phoenix Labs, the developer behind last year&#x27;s Fae Farm and Dauntless, has laid off staff and canceled in-development games as part of a restructuring at the studio. Polygon&#x27;s Nicole Carpenter is reporting on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 100 people at Phoenix Labs were laid off. 
Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of &quot;structural reforms,&quot; starting this week.

                              <span>EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game&#x27;s full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it&#x27;s being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.</span>

                              <span>Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new &quot;narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.&quot; The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today&#x27;s public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It&#x27;s why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


&quot;Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The team&#x27;s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision&#x27;s resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
&quot;Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.&quot; 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division, and Far Cry. 
What kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024&#x27;s surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. 
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.</span>

                              <span>You will need an internet connection to install Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. 
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we&#x27;ll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that&#x27;s not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. 


&quot;Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, following some questions we&#x27;ve noticed in the community,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. 

&quot;We are super excited to bring Assassin&#x27;s Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.&quot; 

As you can see, it&#x27;s clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

                              <span>Italian tech website Giardiniblog.it usually receives around a million visits per month. As of today, the 18-year-old site appears to have lost around 36% of its traffic after being permanently blocked by ISPs for publishing site-blocking workarounds. Following a legal appeal, AGCOM nullified its own blocking order, but the basis for blocking the site in the first place has mission creep written all over it.

                              <span>There are exactly one million metroidy rogueishy action platform games and that is okay. There&#x27;s no such thing as too many of an entertaining thing in a world with, god I dunno, at least thousand humans in? Maybe more? Who knows.
They are rarely my thing, though. I try more than I really want to, for you, and games like Biomorph give me the energy to keep going through the many that leave me indifferent. This isn&#x27;t one of my grudging admissions that a subgenre isn&#x27;t all bad; it&#x27;s a game that I can&#x27;t even think of a way to complain about.

                              <span>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for Nier, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.
Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

Included in the co-op game’s endless war of attrition to protect Super Earth from bugs, robots, and basic awareness of military propaganda, and included in just having mates. Enter player ‘dremskiy’, whose tragic booting from a private game in which they just wanted to make friends has resulted in so many friend requests that their Steam account won’t accept any more.

Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.

Director Jiwon Choi previously teased some DLC concept art, and now it looks like we’ll be seeing that DLC by the time the year’s out, according to a fiscal report.

As in, I’ve been waiting for a videogamey excuse to bang on about it in public for ages. Helldivers 2 is obviously as good an excuse as any, but really, I needn’t have waited so long. Official offerings like strategy game Starship Troopers: Terran Command and FPS Robocop: Rogue City aside, I reckon you can find Paul Verhoeven’s fingerprints all over games.

I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough. This is a bold claim, because there are more than 40 to collect.

                              <span>Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

                              <span>The characters in Read Only Memories: Neurodiver are deeply into anime. They love manga and figurines and trashy movies and horror novels. The interests of the game&#x27;s creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel&#x27;s loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime&#x27;s commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game&#x27;s name (&quot;Neurodiver!&quot;). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

                              <span>Last week, I watched one of my favourite badminton players Kento Momota play his final match. As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn&#x27;t know me - of course he doesn&#x27;t - and I don&#x27;t know him. But for ten years I&#x27;d watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn&#x27;t only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a &#x27;game&#x27; of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

                              <span>I have a couple of takes on Nico Papalia&#x27;s new RPG Athenian Rhapsody, which launched on Steam yesterday and still has a demo. The first is that it&#x27;s a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox&#x27;s Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn&#x27;t so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice.

                              <span>Wayfinder, currently a free-to-play RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, is undergoing a pretty drastic change in its upcoming Echoes patch. Right now it&#x27;s a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it&#x27;ll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that&#x27;s alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It&#x27;s often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.

Yesterday saw the release of an update to the base game&#x27;s swimwear, kicking off the updates teased in the recently-revealed new roadmap, Season Of Love. The roadmap video&#x27;s vibe is that it and its partner saw you from across the bar and wondered if you&#x27;d be interested in joining them, and it kind of weirds me out.

                              <span>I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you&#x27;re talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm&#x27;s perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to &quot;take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results&quot;. Other developers have heeded the call. Here&#x27;s a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0&#x27;s (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

                              <span>Old-school FPS adventure The Explorator contains much more intense shooty violence than the adorable lizardy folk that populate it might immediately suggest. I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.

Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it&#x27;s finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders. And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.

If so, you&#x27;ll probably love the smell of Valheim&#x27;s Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I&#x27;d even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you&#x27;ll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.

                              <span>Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. 
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn&#x27;t mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. 
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.</span>

                              <span>After teasing its reveal earlier this week, Ubisoft has officially unveiled Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan&#x27;s first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn&#x27;t too surprising given it&#x27;s Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate – but it&#x27;s exciting nonetheless. According to the game&#x27;s PlayStation preorder page, players can, &quot;Switch seamlessly between two unlikely allies as you discover their common destiny,&quot; conf…</span>

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game&#x27;s approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here). 
Shortly after the preview, I had a chance to dig deeper into Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble with several of the devel…</span>

                              <span>HBO/Max has released the first look at Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in Season 2 of The Last of Us, and the scenery looks familiar. As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today&#x27;s images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year. 
Pascal&#x27;s Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game&#x27;s beginning where snow is abundant. 
Check out the first official look at Season 2 of The Last of Us for yourself below: 

Pascal and Ramsey are obviously returning cast members for the series, and they&#x27;ll be joined by various newcomers in the show next year. Booksmart&#x27;s Kaitlyn …</span>

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush is getting one final patch today to address some minor issues in the game. Plus, the Hi-Fi Rush X (formerly Twitter) account has reconfirmed a physical edition of the game is coming from Limited Run Games. 
This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game&#x27;s developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won&#x27;t be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today&#x27;s patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit. 
Thank you all for your continued support.

The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox&#x27;s own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it&#x27;s about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Hi-Fi Rush review, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s profile on the life and career of Hi-Fi Rush creator John Johanas. After that, check out this Game Informer feature about exploring Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya with Tango Gameworks.

The first Mortal Kombat movie in this rebooted film series hit theaters on April 23, 2021, and Game Informer had a great time with it – read our 8 out of 10 review to find out why here. Here&#x27;s hoping we enjoy the sequel just as much, if not more. 
Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid will return to direct Mortal Kombat 2, and it will be written by a new writer, Jeremy Slater (alongside McQuoid), who wrote Disney&#x27;s Moon Knight series. Alongside returning cast and characters, The Boys Karl Urban will join the fight as Johnny Cage. 
For more Mortal Kombat, read Game Informer&#x27;s Mortal Kombat 1 review, and then check out John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker debut in the game here.

                              <span>Minecraft is turning fifteen years-old and to celebrate Mojang are running fifteen days of giveaways from May 15th until May 29th. Apparently each day will offer up &quot;a new free Character Creator item representing a different year of Minecraft history.&quot;

This also means I&#x27;ve been playing Minecraft for nearly fifteen years. Do I care for Character Creator items? No. Will I be signing in each day on my son&#x27;s account to get him the free thing? Absolutely.

The latter doesn’t have a title yet, and is described as “a next-gen Life Sim that emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” According to former XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon, it’s “focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”

Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. &quot;Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it&#x27;s always raining,&quot; he tells me. &quot;But there&#x27;s one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!&quot;

                              <span>My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam&#x27;s acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He&#x27;s a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I&#x27;ve been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I&#x27;d say I got my teeth into it, but I&#x27;m not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it&#x27;s release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it&#x27;s drawn for itself.  

It&#x27;s balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam&#x27;s first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I&#x27;d feared, when you&#x27;re playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

                              <span>I booted up Dread Delusion and fell 30 feet to my death. This throwback first-person RPG is hazardous, and not only due to the dreamlike islands floating in the sky. My leg-snappin&#x27; plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

The course is a huge, winding gauntlet made of pieces suspended in midair, and even expert players have fallen from their positions over 1000 times, their cars hurtling back to the bottom of the tower to start again. The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising. They are 11 days into the event.

                              <span>I’d like to start this review with a question: What’s the difference between overcoming a challenge and thinking “I did it!” and one that leaves you sighing “It’s over!”? I may leave little insights scattered throughout. A Paper Trail, if you will. A puzzle game named Paper Trail that has you solve discrete head-scratchers by folding the screen like a piece of paper in different ways to create new paths, I might even say, if I were trying to cram a bunch of information right at the top without breaking theme. Let’s talk about it.

So it’s with all the awe and appreciation in the world that I dove into the demo for retro RPG Whispers In The Moss. It&#x27;s been in development for twelve years, from solo dev Uncultured Games. It&#x27;s set in a vaguely ancient Rome-inspired fantasy world brought to life through intricate and inventive ASCII, and scored with homages to the classics. Ah, but how does it play? You exclaim with evident interest, I assume.

                              <span>Genuinely legendary game designer Ron Gilbert – whose works include the classic adventure game Monkey Island, the RTS Total Annihilation (as producer), and the term “cutscenes” – is making a new game.
The Terrible Toybox website describes it as “Classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park”, and one of the other people working on it is Elissa Black, co-designer and writer of the wonderful Objects In Space… who is also, I’ve just learned from her personal website, working on a retro 90s style turn-based spaceship command game influenced by the 1971 mainframe adaptation of Star Trek. Argh, so many good things in one article.

                              <span>As promised and/or threatened, depending on your perspective, open world game Fallout 4 has gotten some new graphics tweaks and bug fixes to smooth out the bumps caused by its previous “next gen update”. The update broke a bunch of mods, delayed a few interesting overhaul projects like Fallout London, and generally made everyone shake their fists at the sky and shout “Howaaaard!” Remember folks: auteur theory unduly credits a single creative for a group effort - the dice that Todd rolls every time he decides whether or not to break the game are also clearly to blame here.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played little of legendary survival sim The Long Dark, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I&#x27;ve sampled enough to know that adding a &quot;Misery Mode&quot; to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that&#x27;s just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what&#x27;s this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you&#x27;re fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.


It&#x27;s not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It&#x27;s not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you&#x27;ll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.

                              <span>Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch &quot;later this month&quot;, say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë&#x27;s dash and sprint work. We don&#x27;t know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer&#x27;s &quot;distinct style&quot;.

                              <span>A while back Ubisoft revealed about a billion Assassin&#x27;s Creed projects. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was Mirage, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it&#x27;s an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, and it&#x27;s getting an &quot;official cinematic world premiere trailer&quot; debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.
Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.

                              <span>Mullets aren&#x27;t just coming back into fashion, they&#x27;re everywhere at the moment, adopted largely by lads who love draft beer and The Football. And seemingly by Mullet Mad Jack, the protagonist of a single-player roguelike FPS who would shove draft beers into the skull of a billionaire robot, then shoot him in the gonads. What I&#x27;m trying to say is, Mullet Mad Jack is fashionable and no-nonsense, which makes for a great hang if you&#x27;d like to burn some aggression once in a while.

                              <span>The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. 
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. 


Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

From providing the voice of Rucks in Bastion to Red&#x27;s titular Transistor to Hades himself, Cunningham has played a vital part of every Supergiant title. In this rare interview, we ask Logan how he entered the world of voice acting, how he joined Supergiant Games, and which characters are his favorites to play (and which he&#x27;d want to redo). 
Game Informer: When did you first discover that you were good at creating or imitating voices?
Logan Cunningham: I don&#x27;t think there was ever a moment that I discovered that. I always did that. From when I was a kid, my brother and I, we would record stupid little...…</span>

                              <span>Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by Fleabag star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year&#x27;s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon&#x27;s Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. 
This series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a &quot;single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft&#x27;s story in the Tomb Raider series.&quot; 
&quot;With great IP, the possibilities are endless,&quot; Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. &quot;The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft&#x27;s adventures. We&#x27;re honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we&#x27;re looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.&quot; 
This is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix&#x27;s animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. 
If you&#x27;re curious about Crystal Dynamics&#x27; recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

                              <span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game&#x27;s core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.
The books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.

                              <span>Since 2015, the Australian government has commissioned research to understand the level of online infringement and how that changes over time. The latest survey covering 2023 shows overall online content consumption, whether from legal or illegal sources, reached 78% of the population in 2023, up 6% on the previous year. Of those surveyed, however, 41% consumed content from illegal sources in 2023, up from 39% in the previous year.

                              <span>Almost 14 years to the day after Rockstar’s cowboy epic Red Dead Redemption released on consoles, and coming up on five years after its sequel beat it to PC, it looks like the original Red Dead might finally get a PC release.

                              <span>The last few weeks I’ve been watching quite a few YouTube videos (thanks, Evo Japan), and noticing that adverts during videos a) seem to pop up every 30 seconds or so and b) then last for an unskippable 30 to 60 seconds. My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.

Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.

                              <span>The story of Manor Lords’ soundtrack begins, as all inspiring tales do, with hunched-over late-night doom scrolling. It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

On the other hand, Google’s algorithms don’t like it when you spend whole intros handwringing about Google’s algorithms, either, so let’s stop, er, faffing around and speak of Doom. Id Software parent company Zenimax recently trademarked “IDKFA”, a string of letters that will be of deep significance to original Doom players, and which may therefore be evidence of an impending announcement.

                              <span>Like with getting fancy polyhedral dice sets full of all glitter and wool, buying and owning are two different hobbies when it comes to books. I think this has gotten worse (if that&#x27;s the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It&#x27;s really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption&#x27;s sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).
