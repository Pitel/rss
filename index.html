Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have delayed Hogwarts Legacy to next year. 
More specifically, Hogwarts Legacy, originally due out sometime this year, will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 10, 2023. The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today&#x27;s announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

                              <span>An out-of-this-world home makeover
Ever wanted to find a home on a distant planet? Well, Space for Sale will let you explore a planet and build one for others, even with a pal. Just be ready for a little risk and danger.
Space for Sale is a new building and management sim game from Mirage Game Studios, the makers of Little Big Workshop. Revealed at today&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, the goal of Space for Sale is to land on distant planets, spot good plots for new estates, and flip them for massive profit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;36zqJyOBCqA
Of course, the local wildlife is not too keen on you turning their natural habitat into a trendy downtown district. As you build up, it looks like you&#x27;ll need to also keep an eye out for danger. The local flora and fauna can be tamed and researched though, eventually leading to breakthroughs on how to thrive in these biomes.
Building a new neighborhood
Space for Sale will let you explore procedurally generated landscapes, discovering natural resources to harvest and turn into estates. Establishing power lines and construction areas is important, as is satisfying the customers.
Drop-in, drop-out multiplayer will also make it easy for a friend to hop and help construct that new living area alongside you. Everything&#x27;s a bit easier to do with more hands, right?

Honestly, Space for Sale looks like a really fun time. I dig the mix of survival elements and home design, and having to build a nice little home in a world that actively wants you gone. Space for Sale seems ripe for co-op hijinx and plenty of goofs in trying to make some homes on a dangerous planet.
No firm date has been set yet, but Space for Sale is coming soon to PC. You can find the Steam store page here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the hard-knock life for us
Partway through today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, which is low-key giving me old silly Konami E3 vibes, we got an updated look at Gothic 1 Remake. The 2001 role-playing game is coming back on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and whether you&#x27;re in or not will likely depend on your connection to the original back in the day — or maybe a fascination with of-their-time games returning with glossed-up remasters or remakes.
Here&#x27;s a cinematic trailer to (re)introduce the mining colony and the Minecrawlers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Rf4Wd29mRqw
Players will &quot;manage the fate of a lifetime convicted prisoner who must survive in a world of wild animals, creatures, and convicts of dangerous reputation.&quot;
Game developer Alkimia Interactive promises a &quot;modernized combat system&quot; for Gothic 1 Remake, though it hopes to retain an overall &quot;faithful&quot; vibe. That&#x27;s a tricky balancing act for any revival, especially one with a cult following. 20 years can be an eternity in gaming.
In December 2019, THQ Nordic released a Gothic Playable Teaser on Steam, which generated no shortage of fan feedback to take into consideration. As a first introduction, it arguably missed the mark. But as a public test, I think it served its purpose.
Despite this latest promotional push, Gothic 1 Remake doesn&#x27;t have a release date. It&#x27;s still tagged with a vague &quot;coming soon&quot; on Steam, and will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — when it&#x27;s ready. The slow but steady burn continues.
THQ Nordic sure has an interesting collection of games these days.

                              <span>Head back to Derceto Manor
A horror series is getting a new lease on life under THQ Nordic. Alone in the Dark, a &quot;reimagination&quot; of the &#x27;90s cult-classic survival horror game, is in development.
The game was revealed today as part of the THQ Nordic showcase, showing off the setting, gameplay, and more. Pieces Interactive is heading up development, as part of THQ Nordic under the Embracer Group umbrella.
Alone in the Dark will return to the Derceto Manor, with an original story that will still feature some characters and themes from the &#x27;90s trilogy.
Players can once again play as either Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood. Levels and cutscenes will change, depending on which character you&#x27;re controlling at that moment in time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Acch6-3QEWs
Pieces Interactive will try to capture a gothic American South look, mixed in with noir, the Roaring &#x27;20s, and Lovecraftian horror. Mikael Hedberg, the writer behind Soma and Amnesia, is on board to pen the story for Alone in the Dark.
You are not alone (in the dark)
Details about the new game leaked out early today, ahead of the official reveal. While some of the wind was taken out of the sails there, it does seem like people are eager to see what Alone in the Dark will do with this second wind.

Remakes and reimaginings have gone pretty well for the survival horror genre as well. At least, they have for Resident Evil, which has been seeing steady remakes of many of its numbered games, with Resident Evil 4 due up next.
Alone in the Dark, meanwhile, has toiled in the shadows for a while. It hasn&#x27;t seen a new entry since 2015&#x27;s Alone in the Dark: Illumination, which was not very well-received. Even the entry before it didn&#x27;t go quite so well.
A return to the roots of the series might be what Alone in the Dark needs. We&#x27;ll see if Pieces and THQ can deliver it.

If you feeling a little lacking in Hyperdimension Neptunia goodness, then you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that Idea Factory has announced recent spin-off Sisters VS Sisters will be getting a western localization in 2023. The most recent chapter in the Neptunia series launched in Japan back in April of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rvwExZrrgrk
Hyperdimension Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters sees the land of Gameindustri besieged by an oppressive new force, known as the &quot;Trendi Outbreaks.&quot; Guided by the release of a powerful new mobile phone, known as the &quot;rPhone&quot; — all the subtlety of a fucking brick through a window — it is up to NepGear and her friends to restore peace and order to both Planeptune and GameIndustri at large. But with many of the kingdom&#x27;s more powerful goddesses away on another assignment, do NepGear and her pals have what it takes to save the day alone?
Sisters VS Sisters will see the player lead a team of Neptunia superstars into battle against the Trendi Phenomenon. Defeat enemies, level up and evolve your heroes, learn new moves, combos, and chain attacks, and take on an array of sub-missions discovered through the popular social media website &quot;Chirper.&quot; Of course, fans can also look forward to a lot of fun comedic dialogue, a heavy emphasis on character accessorization, unlockable characters, and the obligatory photo mode.
Hyperdimension Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters launches in 2023 on PlayStation and PC platforms.

                              <span>One is live now until August 16, and another is from August 18-22
Two Fallout 76 bonus events are nearly upon us, thanks to a convention, and a series of unfortunate events that led to extra maintenance.
Double XP is happening because of QuakeCon weekend
So from August 18 through August 22, you can net double XP for Fallout 76 in celebration of QuakeCon, which I totally forgot is happening soon. As per usual, the bonus works for any game mode.
As a reminder, QuakeCon is not live in person this year — instead, it&#x27;s happening digitally. Bethesda has planned &quot;new streaming programming, online meetups, giveaways, charity opportunities, the virtual BYOC, and more.&quot; It also promises that it&#x27;s &quot;committed&quot; to an in-person event in 2023.
Double SCORE (season pass XP) is also live now until August 16 at 12PM PT
In a slightly more complicated situation, Fallout 76 encountered some issues earlier this week in terms of maintenance. Bethesda notes that it &quot;ran quite a bit longer than we had originally anticipated,&quot; and as a result, they&#x27;re doing the classic &quot;you get a bonus, and you get a bonus&quot; thing to make up for it.
So, everyone can earn double SCORE, which essentially amounts to season pass leveling XP. The promo is live now, and will run through August 16 at 12PM ET.
It&#x27;s a nice string of Fallout 76 bonus events for those of you who play regularly as you&#x27;ll essentially be able to hop from one event to the other.

In a month&#x27;s time, the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan will open its doors to welcome the country&#x27;s biggest annual gaming event, Tokyo Game Show (TGS). As is the style of the event, a wide variety of developers and publishers will be in attendance to spotlight their new and upcoming hardware and software releases to press and players.
Getting a little ahead of the game, developer Capcom has offered up a teaser of some of the titles that it will be bringing to TGS 2022. Available to play on-site will be upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6, strategy compendium Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, recent adventure expansion Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, and Capcom&#x27;s still-in-development din smasher Exoprimal, which will launch at some point in 2023.
In addition to the floor demos, Capcom has two digital presentations planned for the weekend. September 15 will see Capcom featured as part of the &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program,&quot; which will feature news and updates pertaining to all of the TGS-featured games. September 16 will feature a special Street Fighter 6-centric presentation. While details remain under wraps, I would not be surprised if we do not get further character and gameplay reveals for the highly anticipated sequel.
Tokyo Game Show 2022 will take place September 15-18 in Chiba, Japan. We will be sure to report all of the hottest news and reveals from the event right here on Destructoid.

                              <span>Dana Carvey isn&#x27;t the only Master of Disguise
After encountering hundreds of Yiga clan members in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I never really thought twice about them. Well, justlookingfordragon did!
Amazingly, the entire exercise is framed as a self-imposed mission, as many Breath of the Wild activities often are. In this case, they opted to take photos of the Yiga clan imposters they find out on their travels, then track them down based on those photos. As they point out, &quot;none of the Yiga impersonate &#x27;important&#x27; characters: most are just wandering people with a couple lines of random dialogue.&quot; This actually kind of fits with the theme of just blinding in by taking an ordinary person&#x27;s identity.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild Yiga clan mystery solved
It turns out justlookingfordragons also seemingly figured out better ways to spot the Yiga imposters. They actually only double as Hylians or Hylian-adjacent races (which might be something you already noticed, but is nice to get confirmation on after all this research), and never take the identity of a child or an older resident (or any other race).
They even provided a helpful map (above) for spotting stationary Breath of the Wild Yiga clan members — and you can save and load using a campfire to reset them. If you&#x27;re remotely interested in how the Yiga clan operates, the breakdown is worth the full read. Hopefully they return in the sequel!

                              <span>Pastures new for veteran producer
Veteran Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi has announced that they have left the Resident Evil and Street Fighter developer to take a new role at the Chinese conglomerate NetEase. Kobayashi shared the news with friends, fans, and followers on Twitter earlier today, which just so happens to be the producer&#x27;s 50th birthday.
&quot;I would like to share something very special with everyone,&quot; began Kobayashi. &quot;After serving 27 years with gratitude, I have departed from Capcom on March 31st and will officially be joining NetEase Games as a producer. I will strive to continuously create more enjoyable entertainment experiences for everyone at this new company, in this new era. Thank you for your continued support.&quot;

In the near-three decades spent with Capcom, Kobayashi has worked alongside some of the company&#x27;s most successful and recognizable brands. Kobayashi started out as a key coder for the groundbreaking survival horror title Resident Evil, with the following years seeing him rise through Capcom&#x27;s ranks as a planner, associate producer, and eventually executive producer on titles such as Dino Crisis, killer7, Devil May Cry, and the Sengoku Basara franchise.
Kobayashi&#x27;s move to NetEase Games can be seen as another step in the studio&#x27;s desire to become a bigger play both within the games industry and on the global stage. NetEase already works as a China-based partner to Activision Blizzard, and recently announced the opening of its first U.S.-based studio, Jackalope Games. NetEase Games has been searching for notable staff members over the past year, which included courting Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi. Nagoshi now operates his own studio as a NetEase subsidiary.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty much always game for Pokemon specials
A new Pokemon special titled Arceus Chronicles is set to debut very soon, as The Pokemon Company already has a platform and date: September 23, 2022 on Netflix. Before that though, fans who are attending the 2022 Pokemon World Championships in London will be able to see it at a screening event at 6PM BST on August 19.
Here&#x27;s the synopsis:
&quot;A visit to the Sinnoh region turns into a high-stakes adventure when Ash, Pikachu, and friends join forces with powerful Pokemon to confront a looming threat! When Ash, Goh, and Dawn receive a mysterious message from the Mythical Pokemon Arceus, they meet up with Brock and head to Mount Coronet to investigate. There, they find a rampaging Heatran and the commanders of Team Galactic, who are determined to find their missing leader by opening a gate between dimensions.&quot;

I kind of love the idea of mining a previous region/generation for more story, just like the Pokemon Legends game did before. Given the immense success of Legends, I think there are more of those types of games in the pipeline as we speak. As for the animated tie-in, while I haven&#x27;t kept up on every single episode of the long, long, long-running Pokemon series proper, I do generally watch all the films and specials — particularly the ones that are on YouTube for free. You can watch the trailer below and decide for yourself if you want to partake!

                              <span>The Dracovish distribution mystery gift code is &quot;GANJ0UAG0882&quot;
A Dracovish distribution is currently underway for Pokemon Sword and Shield, as the game clings to life before Scarlet and Violet come and take all the special event fun away.
The code comes compliments of the Pokemon TV show promo in Japan, where the code was announced during a broadcast. It&#x27;s the first code that highlights Ash&#x27;s team, and more codes will come later for Dragonite (August 26), Gengar (September 2), Sirfetch&#x27;d (September 9), and Lucario (September 16). It&#x27;s a neat little promo that also hits a little close to the anime, which is cool. The code is &quot;GANJ0UAG0882,&quot; and you&#x27;ll enter it via the mystery gift system.
With that in mind, I hope Nintendo and Game Freak step things up with Scarlet and Violet. These sorts of themed distribution events are really easy to do and should happen way more often. Ideally, none of them will require anyone to step foot in a GameStop! Currently, we&#x27;re 1/1 on that, with the aforementioned Pikachu event serving as a basic incentive to just pick the game up before the end of February.
With a lot of the innovations from Pokemon Legends already in everyone&#x27;s collective mindset, Scarlet and Violet have a lot to prove; especially when it comes to open-world exploration.

Sega continues to tease the list of rarities and obscurities that will be bundled with its incoming retro hardware, the Sega Mega Drive Mini II. Following on from last month&#x27;s stellar selection, today sees Sega announce 11 more classic Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega CD classics for the cute Mini II console.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;eLDQ6qtZUT0
Featured among the new batch of releases are Mega Drive releases Populous, Gain Ground, and the genre-defining RPG Phantasy Star II, as well as the more obscure Japanese adventures Tougi Ou: King Colossus and Socerian. Representing the Sega Mega CD, we have the ecological-themed remaster Ecco the Dolphin CD, medieval shmup Robo Aleste, and the first release in the beloved Shin Megami Tensei series. With titles such as these, the Sega Mega Drive II is shaping up to be a really refined collector&#x27;s console.
The full list of revealed titles is as follows.
Sega Mega Drive Games:
Gain Ground
Phantasy Star II
Populous
Sorcerian
Tougi Ou: King Colossus
Viewpoint
Sega Mega CD Games:
Ecco the Dolphin CD
Robo Aleste
Romance of the Three Kingdoms III
Shin Megami Tensei
Tenka Fubu: Eiyuu-tachi no Houkou
Sega has already confirmed that the hardware will receive a western release in the form of the Sega Genesis 2, which will be launching day and date alongside the Japanese edition this fall. While we can expect any of the above titles that received an English localization on release to be featured on the western edition of the console, it remains to be seen have the Japan-only titles will be handled.
The Sega Mega Drive II / Genesis 2 Mini launches worldwide October 27.

                              <span>These are pretty universal too
Japan just got a string of Splatoon 3 commercials (as spotted by Nintendo Life), and as usual, they&#x27;re fantastic. And even educationally show off some gameplay!
The best part is that in true Splatoon fashion, you really don&#x27;t need to understand another language to pick up on these commercials. The fun is universal, as each character below is shown being attacked by ink in real life, and fights back with some weapon at their immediate disposal. That includes an umbrella (Brella), bow and arrow (Tri-Stringer), bucket (Slosher), and a brush (Octobrush).
They really nail the vibe of Splatoon, and have made me more excited for the next entry than a lot of the official announcements so far. There&#x27;s something special about hearing the Splatoon soundtrack, listening to that ink noise, and seeing the actual ink color that hits that nostalgia center. I mean Splatoon is &quot;only&quot; seven years old, but that&#x27;s nearly a decade folks! Pretty soon that&#x27;ll enter &quot;retro&quot; territory, depending on where you draw the line.
Either way, I&#x27;m just happy that Splatoon survived, and wasn&#x27;t a casualty of the Wii U&#x27;s fantastic fireball of a death.

Publisher Warner Bros. and developer Player First Games have announced the rescheduled season one release date for MultiVersus — and fans will be super-stoked to hear that they won&#x27;t have much longer to wait, as platform brawler&#x27;s first wave of new content will begin its drip-feed as soon as August 15.
From Monday, players can dive into the free-to-play fighter&#x27;s first battle pass, which will offer up skins, power-ups, and other goodies as you bash your way through MultiVersus&#x27; roster of pop culture superstars. The battle pass will include bonus items for all, though players who have stumped up the dollar for the Premium version will, of course, earn far more items and exclusive in-game rewards.

Player First Games has been quick to remind the player base that all of seaso…</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t call it a comeback...
&#x27;90s developer Sunsoft, perhaps best known for its range of 8-bit licensed adventures and 16-bit platformers, has announced that it will be holding a special digital presentation next week, wherein the company will announce several titles scheduled to release over 2023 and the remainder of 2022.
&quot;Although we have been quiet for some time, many things have been happening behind the scenes,&quot; declares Sunsoft general manager Yuichi Ochi in a press release. &quot;We are very excited to be able to finally share our vision for the rebirth of Sunsoft with fans old and new.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tTfmwHxy52U
Originally formed in 1978 as a subsidiary of the legendary Sun Corporation, Sunsoft spent much of the 1980s in the electronic gaming market, before transitioning to video games via a plethora of NES releases, including Blaster Master, Fester&#x27;s Quest, Xenophobe, Batman, and Gremlins 2: The New Batch. In the early &#x27;90s, Sunsoft began developing and publishing titles for the 16-bit market, creating a slew of, frankly, exceedingly middling platformers, brawlers, and adventure games for the Sega Genesis and SNES. Perhaps Sunsoft&#x27;s best-known character is the platforming star Aero the Acro-Bat.
Sunsoft would enter a period of bankruptcy in 1995, but has always remained in the industry, albeit in an incredibly scaled-down capacity. Just last year, the company asked fans which of its classic IPs they would like to see receive a remaster or remake, so it&#x27;s quite possible that next week&#x27;s presentation will see the company announce several comebacks for the studio&#x27;s portfolio of titles.
The Sunsoft digital event will take place on Thursday, August 18 at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST and can be watched on the official Sunsoft YouTube channel. We will, of course, be sure to bring you all of the details right here on Destructoid.

Not far into Cult of the Lamb, you&#x27;ll be presented with a surprisingly tough decision: what to name your blossoming cult. Coming up with a fitting name for the individual animal cultists is easy enough — let&#x27;s be honest, they&#x27;re highly replaceable — but picking out a catchy, long-lasting name for the whole group? Once again, I struggled to decide.
If you aren&#x27;t feeling original, that&#x27;s okay — you can stick with &quot;Cult of the Lamb.&quot; I did.
And if you&#x27;re just digging into the beginning of the game, you&#x27;ve got a while to think it over. The cult-naming decision doesn&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;ve successfully run through Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s first dungeon biome a few times. After you&#x27;ve performed a ritual for your flock and handled some other tutorial tasks,…</span>

I haven&#x27;t been back to Fall Guys since its free-to-play transformation. But the new Sonic the Hedgehog event, including a bespoke ring-collecting Bean Hill Zone level, got me to update and boot up the game again. Is it worth your time? Yes — well, to a point.

If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s dead set on winning, you might have a bad time, in a way that feels too out of your hands. If you&#x27;re looking for a chaotic casual play session — just long enough to clear the challenges for Sonic-themed rewards — then it&#x27;s a decent excursion.
Across three escalating rounds, which ultimately name just a single overall winner, the idea is to collect enough rings to avoid being culled from the greedy pack.

In an industry where constant reinvention is the name of the game, Inflexion Games&#x27; &quot;shared world survival crafting game&quot; Nightingale seems like it will bring a fresh experience to players... when it&#x27;s eventually out. While the studio initially estimated that the game would be out by the end of 2022, Inflexion has just announced that Nightingale will now be releasing in early access sometime in the &quot;first half of 2023.&quot;
In the announcement tweet from the studio, they also promised to give &quot;more game and development updates from the team&quot; soon.
The letter from Inflexion stated two main reasons for Nightingale&#x27;s delay, one of which is the usual allowance of extra time for the developers to polish and tighten up the gameplay, the world, etc.

                              <span>Bah gawd, that&#x27;s Iron Galaxy
If you&#x27;ve ever played a battle royale and thought the whole shooting thing was a little dry, there&#x27;s a new battle royale out today that should solve that and then some. Rumbleverse is live today, bringing chops, kicks, and high-flying throws to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.
If you haven&#x27;t seen it before, Rumbleverse is essentially a wrestling battle royale from Iron Galaxy, the studio behind games like Wreckateer and Divekick. The studio&#x27;s had a fair bit of experience working on fighting games, and it shows in Rumbleverse.
The 40-person grappler royale has players rush throughout a city, grabbing special magazines full of moves to then employ against other players. Melee weapons like bats and chairs are also in the mix, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;suOmxeeyRsI
There&#x27;s a standard battle royale mode, or Solo Mode, as well as a recently revealed Duos Mode where players can team up. There&#x27;s also a Playground Mode, which will let users explore Grapital City at their own place. It&#x27;s kind of like the training room equivalent, for this wide world of wrestling.
Total knockout
Rumbleverse is free-to-play as well, and it has crossplay enabled. You can also form cross-platform parties for Duos, though you&#x27;ll need to add each other through the Epic Games Launcher to make that happen. The FAQ on Iron Galaxy&#x27;s site has an easy-to-follow rundown for how to make that happen.
While the game launches today, its first season kicks off next week on August 18, with a Battle Pass available for purchase then. There are also special bundles for Rumbleverse, if you want to start out with some extra cosmetics and shop bucks.
Fortnite may potentially be getting Goku, but for those who really want to brawl, seems like Rumbleverse is a solid option. It&#x27;s out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via Epic.

Asus, then, are about to increase the number of OLED gaming monitors on the market by 100%, with the ROG Swift PG48UQ and ROG Swift PG42UQ. And I’ve just had a brief, but generally impressive, play around with them.

                              <span>Of the many games announced during THQ Nordic&#x27;s Showcase this evening, Space For Sale is the one that caught my eye the most, primarily because it looks a bit like Animal Crossing with aliens. In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase &#x27;colony sim&#x27; to its literal extreme, didn&#x27;t they? Are we sure that isn&#x27;t Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I&#x27;m saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn&#x27;t... astronommical. Sorry. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

This time it&#x27;s a reimagining of the original 1992 game, where you&#x27;ll delve into Derceto Manor as returning characters Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby in an attempt to figure out what&#x27;s happened to Hartwood&#x27;s missing uncle. As you&#x27;d expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.

It&#x27;s called Wreckreation (you know, like &#x27;recreation&#x27;, not Wreck-reaction, or Wreck–eation) and its reveal trailer looks a bit like if Burnout and Hot Wheels went for a joyride together.

Well, Ghostrunner and Graven devs Slipgate Ironworks hope to provide an answer with their latest real-time tactics base-building game, Tempest Rising. Revealed earlier this evening during THQ Nordic&#x27;s summer showcase, Tempest Rising is a retro-inspired strategy game where you&#x27;ll take control of three factions fighting for a rare mineral. And yep, that mineral is called &#x27;Tempest&#x27;. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven&#x27;t shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat&#x27;s in-game meow. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I&#x27;m beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale: Requiem for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they&#x27;ll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it&#x27;s like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

                              <span>&quot;Metroidvania&quot; is a terrible phrase that gets in the way of its own definition and I hate it.


It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You&#x27;re a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

                              <span>Of course they do!
Kirby&#x27;s 30th Anniversary Music Fest gave us plenty of surprises yesterday on top of some top-tier renditions of incredible Kirby music, but one of the concert&#x27;s biggest &quot;wow&quot; moments from a certain guest appearance — Kirby&#x27;s voice actor.
Yes, Kirby really does have a voice; it&#x27;s not just a conglomeration of noises! But, even better than that, she&#x27;s pretty adorable herself. Makiko Ohmoto has been voicing the pink puffball in video games ever since the original Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64 and made her series debut in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. She&#x27;s played the little guy ever since, and arguably, it&#x27;s because of her voice that so many people have fallen in love with the character.

Here at Nintendo Life, we are suckers for game titles which are so weird that you can&#x27;t help but laugh, and we think that D-Pad Studio&#x27;s upcoming release may just take the biscuit. The development team behind 2018&#x27;s stunning pixel platformer, Owlboy, is back with — are you ready for this one? — Vikings on Trampolines! Yes, you read that right, it&#x27;s Vikings and they&#x27;re on trampolines.
Towards the end of last month, the studio shared a tweet claiming that they would be revealing its new game at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, but today&#x27;s trailer reveal (from IGN) suggests that the event will be solely for getting your hands on a playable demo.

As we all wait for the re-release of GoldenEye 007 that may or may not happen (at this rate, we&#x27;ll probably believe it when we see that sweet icon on our Switch home screens), you might want to check out a pretty awesome documentary on the making of the N64 classic from production company Altitude Films.
It&#x27;s a solid feature length look at the creation and subsequent impact of GoldenEye 007 and we had a proper good time with it; you can read our full review for all the lowdown:

When you were a kid, &quot;sandbox&quot; meant &quot;small plastic box, usually full of sand and ants, which lets you pretend you&#x27;re at the beach even though you&#x27;re in a nursery down the road from your parents&#x27; workplace&quot;. As an adult, &quot;sandbox&quot; either means &quot;a game that lets you choose most of your goals&quot; or &quot;ant-filled nightmare that gets your child all gritty&quot;, depending on whether or not you have kids.
Don&#x27;t worry. Today, we&#x27;re focusing on sandbox-as-in-video-game, a genre of entertainment in which most of the enjoyment is derived from setting your own targets. Sandboxes range from the no-direction-at-all end of the spectrum, like Garry&#x27;s Mod (a PC-only asset toybox), through the some-direction games like Minecraft and Astroneer, all the way to games that hold your hand or guide you a lot more towards goals, like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing.

Hogwarts Legacy, the upcoming action RPG based on the world of Harry Potter, has bagged a firm release date... Just not for the Switch.
If you&#x27;re on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, you&#x27;ll be playing Hogwarts Legacy on February 10th, 2023. It seems, however, that developer Avalanche Software needs a bit more time with the Switch version to &quot;deliver the best possible game experience&quot;, though this statement could potentially have applied to all versions of the game given it had a projected launch window of &quot;Late 2022&quot; until today.

There&#x27;s only one month to go until the Tokyo Game Show, which starts on September 15th, and Capcom has today started to reveal what we can expect them to show off this year. For Nintendo fans, the answer is not much, but there are a few things to be excited about.
Four games will be available in playable demos at the Capcom show booth on both September 17th and 18th, with Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection topping the ranking for Switch-bound titles. The company has also announced that Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak will be at its booth as well.

                              <span>Probably not, honestly.
More than five years after its initial launch, the Switch has amassed a vast library of first-party games from Nintendo, including the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. What&#x27;s apparent with these titles, however (and indeed the entire first-party catalogue), is that none of them have been granted a permanent price drop. It&#x27;s no surprise either, since all of them are still selling pretty well for the most part, which ultimately begs the question: does Nintendo even need to drop the price on their games?
The short answer is no, probably not. But you&#x27;re not here for the short answer! In the below video, the delightful Zion, Alex, and Felix spend a good 36 minutes discussing this very topic, exploring the reasoning for and against price drops, the value that games provide in comparison to films or TV shows, and regional price conversions.

The Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct revealed a whole lotta info about the upcoming sequel, including new game modes, maps and weapons. It is the latter of these that immediately caught our eye, with the slashing Splatana Wiper and accurate Tri-Stringer both promising to make an inky splash on the battlefield when the game releases on September 9th.

It appears that those savvy marketing specialists at Nintendo have shared our passion for the game&#x27;s quirky weapons, as the company has shared a new series of Japanese trailers showing these items at play in the real world (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).

Entertainment retailer Zavvi has released a new Pokémon clothing range called the &#x27;Legendary Collection&#x27;, offering up a nice selection of t-shirts and shoes, as well as a couple of other items. All the items are available to buy right now, so if there&#x27;s anything that catches your eye, now&#x27;s your chance to snag &#x27;em.
As you might have guessed, the collection features Legendary Pokémon throughout – we&#x27;re pretty fond of that Mewtwo sweatshirt and the Zapdos trainers, we must say. You can see the whole range below, but note that a special deal can be had by adding the bucket hat and a t-shirt into your basket, which will knock their combined price down to £22.99.

There has been no solid news of a Star Fox game on the Switch and Nintendo fans are growing restless. None more so is this case than modder KandoWontu who is getting close to completing work on &#x27;Star Fox Exploration Showcase&#x27;, a mod for the 16-bit SNES classic which not only strives to adapt the original game, but to build entirely new structures into it including new levels, ships, weapons and (yes, you guessed it) a fully-functional multiplayer mode.
Just what did it take to get into this iconic game code in the first place, and when will we be able to get our paws on it? Jack Yarwood over at our new sister site, Time Extension, got the chance to sit down with KandoWontu to find out all this and more.

In an interview with Nikkei, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa says that, while semiconductor supply issues are looking to improve for the remainder of this fiscal year, next year looks more &quot;uncertain&quot;. This follows the publication of Nintendo&#x27;s financial report for Q1 2022-2023.
In last week&#x27;s financials, Nintendo reported a 22.9% drop in profits for April - June 2022, but the company also reassured people that it would not be increasing the price of the Switch and that the semiconductor shortages would improve over the summer and autumn period.

Kobayashi started out as a programmer on the Resident Evil series in the &#x27;90s and took up producer roles for series like Dino Crisis, Sengoku Basara and Devil May Cry. He&#x27;s also credited as a producer on the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma series and in more recent times was executive producer on Mega Man 11. He shared his latest career move via social media:

Following on from all sorts of collaborations, it seems the Dragon Ball universe is now making its way to Epic&#x27;s popular battle royale game Fortnite.

As Inklings and Octolings around the globe look forward to the release of Splatoon 3, it seems Nintendo is just as busy winding down the services and goodies that shipped alongside Splatoon 2, when it was originally released.
This includes the exclusive Switch Online Splatoon 2 gear. As you might recall, if you signed up to the NSO service on a single or family subscription for 12 months, you would unlock an &#x27;Online Jersey&#x27; and &#x27;Online Squidkid V Shoes&#x27; here in the west.

Fortunately, there are other events stepping up, and one of them is Super Smash Con - taking place at the Dulles Expo Center in Chantilly, VA. It&#x27;s happening this week from August 11th through to August 14th and will host thousands of fans with live competitions, music and more.

                              <span>FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team mode will follow previous games by including loot boxes, EA have confirmed. In the past few years, several studies have linked loot boxes with gambling, and several European countries have moved to regulate them. In a statement given to Eurogamer, EA said that Ultimate Team packs are &quot;a part of FIFA that players love&quot; and that &quot;Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair.&quot;

                              <span>This is a bit different from what we normally cover, but I was going to order this for myself and thought it might be of interest to you, dear reader, as well. Anyway, you can get ten years&#x27; worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that&#x27;s a nice little savings - and of course it&#x27;s far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

It&#x27;s capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it&#x27;s dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

You can&#x27;t deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You&#x27;re okay.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port&#x27;s development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

                              <span>Welcome once again to The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we&#x27;ve decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It&#x27;s an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s still going strong
Following a cancellation in 2020 and a pivot to a &quot;Fall Fest&quot; in 2021, Super Smash Con has returned to Chantilly, VA to once again showcase some of the best competitors the Smash community has to offer. While Super Smash Con (or &quot;SSC&quot;) is primarily a tournament-based event, there&#x27;s some other activities on offer that people can enjoy separately, or while waiting for the next match to start. Here&#x27;s a look at Super Smash Con 2022.

So one of my favorite elements of Smash Con (or any con really) is the dealer area, and that hasn&#x27;t changed. It&#x27;s row after row of merch from a combination of local and national stores and individual artists, with everything from retro video game and board game sales, to drawings and bead art.

Narrative games may be a small niche within the gaming industry as a whole, but there’s an even smaller subsection of the genre that a lot of gamers don’t know about: interactive fiction also known as IF. With the exception of some UI upgrades or a musical score, the vast majority of IF is just simple text on a screen that the player clicks through. It exists in the space between my two favorite things: literature and video games. Technically interactive fiction got its start in the late 1970s with text adventures like Zork, but now the world of text-based games has taken on a whole new life.
I’ve always dabbled in the world of IF, but when I came across this thread on Twitter, it reminded me that the community surrounding this genre is mo…</span>

A new sports RPG is on the scene, and it&#x27;s delivering quite the kick. Soccer Story is a new soccer-based RPG adventure, arriving on PC, Nintendo Switch, Stadia, PlayStation, and Game Pass later this year.
This new adventure is published by No More Robots and is in development at PanicBarn. You might know them as the studio behind dystopian American life sim series Not Tonight. As you can see, Soccer Story is a bit more fantasy and light-hearted. Or at least, at first glance.
In the world of Soccer Story, the Calamity has torn apart the foundations of soccer. You, the player, have been chosen by a magic football to become the Savior of Soccer, bringing salvation and harmony to the world once more.
How? Well, with plenty of goals, of course.

Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?! is this week&#x27;s free PC game on the Epic Games Store. If you like the idea of a cooking simulator you can play alone or with a partner, this one&#x27;s wild — it&#x27;s set on a roving food truck in the &quot;radically-changed war-torn America of 2042.&quot;
After years of not quite breaking into the Cook, Serve, Delicious! series, I recently gave the second game another try and had a much better time handling food orders with a co-op partner on the same couch. So much so, I also picked up the third game on sale, and am now looking forward to the next title from Vertigo Gaming, Cook Serve Forever.
Unlike Overcooked, this game isn&#x27;t about moving around stage hazards, and you&#x27;ll have far more control over the types of food you&#x27;ll serv…</span>

Warner Bros. Games has released another character trailer for its upcoming open-world actioner Gotham Knights. Following on from previous showcases on Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl, this new trailer takes a look at the brutal, no-nonsense, gun-toting style of perhaps Gotham&#x27;s most dangerous vigilante, Red Hood.
As a former Robin and close confidant of The Dark Knight himself, Jason Todd learned his master&#x27;s ways in the art of close combat, stealth tactics, and precise detective work. However, following his death at the hands of The Joker and subsequent resurrection in the Lazarus Pit, Todd returned with a much shorter fuse, a deeper hatred of criminality, and an immensely more brutal approach to the concept of crime-fighting. While still a staunch ally of The Bat Family, Todd typically walks alone, perpetually on the razor-thin line of becoming the very thing he hates most.

Lacking the finesse of his Gotham Knights brethren, Red Hood brings core strength and ranged dominance to the party, taking down foes with bone-breaking close-quarters-combat and an array of firearms-based abilities. What he lacks in grace, Todd makes up for in raw power and earnest brutality. Unequipped with grapple abilities, Todd is able to traverse the high points of the city via air-bending skills powered by his trip to the Lazarus Pit. When the acrobatics of Nightwing or the precision of Batgirl cannot get the job done, Red Hood is here as your Mack Truck — the Knights&#x27; terrifying battering ram.
Hilariously, we are assured Todd is &quot;non-lethal&quot; in Gotham Knights, despite his rat-a-tat-tat actions.
Gotham Knights launches October 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>One of the top requests from fans was &quot;more challenging content&quot;
Right from the get-go, there was a wide variety of reactions to Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The copious &quot;chaos!&quot; exclamations in the reveal were definitely a driving factor in that divide, but as I dug into the game at launch, I found a lot to like, including some of the bolder and somewhat out-there choices with the narrative.
We sat down recently with director Daisuke Inoue and producer Jin Fujiwara to really take in the game&#x27;s impact thus far, and where it might be going now that the DLC campaign is underway.
[There are story spoilers for the Stranger of Paradise core game present throughout the interview.]

A new crossover is headed to Epic Games&#x27; Fortnite, and it will rock the dragon. After a ton of rumors, chatter, and speculation, it looks like Dragon Ball is arriving in Fortnite.
The Fortnite Twitter account posted this ominous image of Shenron, the wish-granting dragon, today. &quot;Speak,&quot; it says. &quot;Name your wish...&quot;
As for now, it&#x27;s not clear what exactly this entails. More info looks to be arriving next week, on August 16.
https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1557728549737443336
Speculation has run rampant over Dragon Ball arriving in Fortnite for a while. The leaker community around Epic&#x27;s battle royale discovered a bunch of files that pointed towards skins and cosmetics, even including the Capsule Corp logo.
Rock the dragon
As for who&#x27;s up, I think an obvious answer would be Goku. The same way you can&#x27;t do Naruto and not include the major players, Goku and likely Vegeta are sound bets. I&#x27;d like some less obvious characters too, like Piccolo, Bulma, or Yamcha, but those would probably be relegated to a second pack, much like some of the Naruto options were.
I&#x27;m hoping for some kind of in-game event as well, whether it&#x27;s another special map like the Hidden Leaf Village or possibly an in-game happening. King Kai willing, we get a Kamehameha weapon.
But I have to say, seeing some Dragon Ball content drop in Fortnite sounds pretty exciting. Growing up on Toonami instilled quite a bit of nostalgia for the series in me, and it was doubled, maybe even tripled, with the love letter that is Dragon Ball FighterZ.
So yes, I&#x27;m quite looking forward to August 16 and whatever it entails. Hopefully we&#x27;ll all be able to finally learn who would win in a fight, John Cena or Goku. We&#x27;ll just have to wait until next week to get that much closer to our answer.

If there is one thing my Apple Arcade subscription has taught me over the past few years, it’s that games designed around gacha mechanics don’t necessarily have to be the type of whale-hunting monstrosities that result in terrible YouTube “influencers” bragging about how they can’t play anybody online anymore because they spent $100,000 in it. Games like World of Demons and Star Trek: Legends are enjoyable gacha games in part because you don’t have menus popping up constantly goading you into dropping cash in them. With that monetary incentive removed from these titles, players are free to enjoy the actual gameplay without worrying they’ll miss out on something huge if they don’t buy a loot box or start a game-specific subscription service.

Marco and the crew will be going on a tactical adventure a bit later than expected. Dotemu and Leikir Studio&#x27;s Metal Slug Tactics is delayed, and now aiming for a 2023 launch.
In a statement on social media today, Dotemu says the team needs a little extra time.
&quot;Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make Metal Slug Tactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023!&quot;
The news also came with a new piece of artwork, which is at least pretty rad.

All&#x27;s fair in love and tactics
The combination of SNK arcade series Metal Slug and a healthy heaping of tactics was revealed during last year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest kick-off stream. Made in partnership with SNK, the game&#x27;s a collaboration between Leikir Studio and well-known makers of arcade-style games and retro revivals, Dotemu.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;DqF0KLsaf6U
The new Tactics entry will follow Marco and the gang through battle after battle. It&#x27;s got the distinct Metal Slug look, but from an isometric, Into the Breach-style perspective. Metal Slug Tactics will also apparently have some perks and skill trees to work with, though we haven&#x27;t seen too much of the actual game at this point. The project&#x27;s been largely quiet, aside from a trailer or two.
I&#x27;ve dumped countless quarters into Metal Slug machines over the years, and I&#x27;m a big fan of tactics games, so I&#x27;m primed to dig this one. Dotemu has built up some goodwill over the years too. While I was hoping to get hands-on with Metal Slug Tactics this year, we&#x27;ve not been hurting for good strategy games in 2022 anyways. Pushing Metal Slug out to 2023 only means we&#x27;ll have even more tactics to look forward to next year, too.

Mobile game developer Huuuge Games has proudly announced that it has smashed its &quot;Wish 200 Week&quot; fundraising event, with a grand total of around $490,000 USD raised for the UK Make-A-Wish Foundation, the non-profit organization that facilitates dream requests for critically ill children.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Wish 200 Week, which took place between July 18-22, saw Huuuge Games partner with numerous publishers, developers, and streamers to engage in five days of fundraising efforts. British studio Hutch and Swiss browser game builder Miniclip were also involved in the event, the second of which to be held within the past two years.
&quot;We are extremely proud that the united gaming community came together once again to help Make-A-Wish UK with their Wish 200 Week, with this donation a lot of ill children and their families will see their gaming dreams come to life,&quot; said Huuuge Games co-CEO Rod Cousens in a press release. &quot;Gaming is a big part of young people’s lives and we know how it can be a great escape from the troubles of real life. We are especially glad that 200 children in need will have their gaming wishes granted with our help.&quot;
All of the money raised will go directly to Make-A-Wish UK, where it will be used to fund the wishes of 200 children. For more details on the work done by Make-A-Wish UK, visit the official website.

Taking place in Santo Ileso (which is an amalgamation of the American Southwest), you&#x27;ll join up with your in-game buddies (Neenah [get-away driver], Eli [behind-the-scenes assistant], and Kevin [on-the-field partner]) as well as your out-of-game-buddies (with co-op) to reform the Saints in this new reboot universe. Amid commentary from in-universe characters, this six-minute Saints Row trailer walks you through the core concepts: creating your criminal empire, and exploring Santo Ileso. Even if you aren&#x27;t interested in the story at all, the trailer does a pretty good job of showcasing general mechanics, like the customization options, side mission activities, and modes of locomotion (including gliding).
It&#x27;ll be really interesting to see the audience reaction here. Based on my prior hands-on I really dig the world map, but the general vibe and tone are going to hit differently depending on what kind of Saints Row fan you are. After all, the series has kind of been all over the place on that front, and it&#x27;s really hard to top the prior &quot;aliens/superpowers/hell&quot; combo. Rebooting and resetting made perfect sense.

                              <span>PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch ports revealed
Red Art Games has announced that frenetic, bullet hell shmup Shinorubi will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in early 2023, alongside the official release of the PC edition — which is currently available via Steam Early Access.
Shinorubi spins a tale of a precious mineral, known as &quot;R-R.&quot; This mineral, which grants incredible power and longevity, has been greedily hoarded for over a thousand years by the aristocratic BAÄA family and its ruler, King R.LOYD III. However, legend tells of a coming solstice that will afford the opportunity to topple the rule of BAÄA, and, with the fateful day approaching, eight rebellious members of the king&#x27;s own army plan to wrest the power from the family&#x27;s grasp, once and for all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UEBPGROX3UY
The first title from shmup-lovin&#x27; studio Last Boss 88, Shinorubi is a vertically scrolling danmaku that hopes to put even the most veteran bullet hell fans to the test. Offering up eight unique characters — each with their own distinct playstyle — players will blast their way through waves of enemy vessels before squaring off against the king&#x27;s own private army of generals, led by his ruthless daughter, Nemesis. Shinorubi will offer up multiple difficulty settings, an array of arrange modes, and 4K/120fps visuals on PS5 and Xbox Series X.
Shinorubi launches in early 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. It is available right now on Steam Early Access. Physical editions are currently in the works, with details to follow at a later date.

                              <span>In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot &#x27;em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven&#x27;t heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

It seems cool, so I&#x27;ll play it with former Associate Editor John Carson today!
We&#x27;re going live at 2:00 p.m. Central on our Twitch page, and then I&#x27;ll upload it to the Game Informer YouTube channel afterward. See you soon.</span>

Your followers’ faith in your cult drives everything in Cult of the Lamb.

                              <span>Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it&#x27;s polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion&#x27;s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a &quot;comedy open-world RPG&quot; where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You&#x27;ll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

                              <span>For weeks now, leaks and rumors have pointed to a Dragon Ball Z collaboration happening with Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite. Now, such a crossover has been officially confirmed. 
Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, &quot;Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022.&quot; Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let&#x27;s be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we&#x27;ll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today&#x27;s overview trailer reveals that Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That&#x27;s exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby&#x27;s different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too).

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…</span>

                              <span>HBO hopes that its upcoming Games of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon will be as successful as  its predecessor but in the short term, the company has a major problem. A Reddit user claims to have leaked plot summaries for every single episode, noting that two account suspensions by Reddit add credibility to those leaks. Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO&#x27;s lawyers in California.

The Splatoon 3 Direct was full of juicy info to get us ready for the upcoming squid shooter sequel, which will be released on September 9th. But like all good Nintendo fans, we weren&#x27;t watching the Direct just for the game updates, oh no, we were also on the hunt for Nintendo Easter eggs.
One such callback came in the form of an extended reach into the company&#x27;s past. Harmony, the overseer of Splatsville&#x27;s new general store, Hotlantis, can be seen playing with a Nintendo Ultra Hand — an extendable grabber toy that was manufactured by Nintendo back in the 1960s.

                              <span>Lamb do the slaughter.
Devolver Digital&#x27;s latest game in their stables of gory, bizarre, and irreverent releases is Massive Monster&#x27;s Cult of the Lamb, a game so perfectly-pitched to the Devolver crowd that it&#x27;s hard to believe it wasn&#x27;t an in-house project. It&#x27;s a cult simulator, but with cute li&#x27;l woodland animals instead of bloodthirsty human-types or Cthulhuses (although you can get a Cthulhu skin as part of a pre-order bonus, actually), making all the ritual sacrifice and cannibalism look so cuuuuuuuute.
That combination of cutesy and culty is the culmination of many, many months prototyping and flinging ideas at the wall in Massive Monster HQ, but now that the game is out, it&#x27;s receiving reviews that make all that work worthwhile (our review is coming soon, don&#x27;t worry — PC codes were sent out earlier than Switch ones!).

                              <span>But just what does the fox say?
Disney&#x27;s Robin Hood was never given an official tie-in video game, but if it ever did, then we would hope that it would look a little something like Of Blades &amp; Tails, an action-oriented turn-based RPG which will be coming to Switch next year.
The top-down pixelated RPG market is a tough industry for games to stand out in, but in how many other RPGs do you get to play as a fox with a sword? You will play as Reik, a well-respected member of the fox tribe who journeys across a fantastical land inhabited by a host of different animals. Expect hack-and-slash combat in a turn-based format as you either follow the main story or search for treasures in dungeons.

If you&#x27;re the kind of gamer who prefers pigs to punches and geese to guns, you&#x27;ll no doubt have experienced what we&#x27;re going to call the Material Bottleneck. Whether you&#x27;re adding fences to your field in Stardew Valley or trying to figure out where to put your compost bin in Rune Factory, your lack of building materials — wood, stone, iron — can really put a halt to any plans you might have had. And what are you supposed to do? Let your cows roam free?!

Reverse engineering has been happening for the Apple Silicon graphics processor, early experiments being carried out under macOS and Asahi&#x27;s m1n1 environment, and the next step will be to start writing a Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) kernel driver.

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd.

Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off.

I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi.</span>

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter.

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Včera AMD zveřejnilo detaily zranitelnosti SQUIP (Scheduler Queue Usage via Interference Probing) CVE-2021–46778. Nové procesory AMD Zen2, Zen3 a Apple M1 mají sdílené fronty pro mikroinstrukce. Pokud proces na stejném jádře přesně měří obsazenost této fronty, může se dozvědět, co dělá jádro – sourozenec (SMT). Uhodnout jde například RSA klíč. Ve skutečnosti Apple M1 nemá SMT, ale pokud by v budoucnu Apple měl procesory se SMT, tak by také patrně byly zranitelné.</span>

                              <span>Elite Dangerous&#x27;s Update 13 is live now, bringing an end to the two-year-long Azimuth Saga and laying the groundwork for the space sim&#x27;s ominously titled next chapter, Aftermath. There&#x27;s a cinematic video below which reveals the climax of the event, and then I&#x27;ll dig into the patch notes a little.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s patch 1.06 offers dozens of small tweaks that should make your journey across The Land Between just a little easier. The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and &#x27;path of least resistance&#x27; kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

Rather than simply die and reload a save, you&#x27;ll respawn elsewhere in the world, ready to hunt down your new named Nemesis. They might even loot your gear and use it against you.

                              <span>A lawsuit filed last year by several Hollywood studios and Netflix targeting illegal streaming veteran PrimeWire now resembles a war of attrition. As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement &#x27;HydraWire&#x27;. But despite the numerous hurdles, all signs point to the plaintiffs toughing the case out for as long as it takes.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we&#x27;ll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine&#x27;s Day and the second arriving in April.

The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega&#x27;s mascot.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you&#x27;ll soon find out, it&#x27;s anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that&#x27;s harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn&#x27;t). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega&#x27;s iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic&#x27;s iconic sneakers.
Those aren&#x27;t the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn&#x27;t Sonic&#x27;s first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.</span>

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he takes you through a full mission in Square Enix&#x27;s upcoming real-time tactical RPG, The DioField Chronicle. Not only will you be getting a glimpse at what combat in the game looks like, but he gives you a brief glimpse of what you&#x27;re doing in The DioField Chronicle when you&#x27;re not in a battle. 
Developed by Lancarse and Square Enix, this RPG is aiming to feel unique amongst a sea of other tactical RPGs by infusing real-time combat into its formula. So while you are controlling units on a battlefield, you&#x27;re watching their moves play out in real-time, and you must adjust your classic tried-and-true TRPG strategies to match it. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Enjoy this first look at The DioField Chronicle as Wesley walks you through one full expedition in the game before showing you around the main palace that acts as your home base. The demo showcased here takes place completely within Chapter 1 so if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, you should be alright. The DioField Chronicle hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Sept. 22.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns&#x27; turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

                              <span>O možnosti nastavit hostname&#x3D; jako parametr jádra jsme již před necelými třemi měsíci informovali. Nyní se většinou nastavuje hostname až v user-space, případně při překladu jádra ( CONFIG_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME). Jsou ale některé případy, kdy je potřeba hostname ještě před přimoutováním /. Například mdadm potřebuje hostname a porovnává ho se záznamem homehost pro rozlišení lokálního pole a dočasně připojeného cizího pole.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That&#x27;s the best price we&#x27;ve seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

                              <span>Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD&#x27;s first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we&#x27;re now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it&#x27;s been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

                              <span>You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2&#x27;s first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I&#x27;m proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I&#x27;ve bested it. I should say &quot;we&quot;, as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie&#x27;s highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

                              <span>After five weeks, 12 posts, 14 games, and 11,146 words, my cycling tour of PC gaming ended on Friday. I&#x27;ve crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that&#x27;s now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

                              <span>Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?&#x27; A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

This week, my eye has been caught by a surreal RPG, a squirrel with a gun, a typical tentacle horror, handcrafted spaceships, and plenty more interesting indies.

                              <span>Demons happened. There&#x27;s your plot. More specifically, they apparently happened to everyone except you, but the process still messed with your tv, so there&#x27;s nothing for it but to fight your way through them to some kind of solution.


Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe&#x27;s Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don&#x27;t often blend as well as this, and I&#x27;m disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t got a bigger reception.

BREIN also booked significant progress on the site blocking front, an effort that continues this year. Meanwhile, its plan to warn and educate persistent infringers is taking longer than expected.

                              <span>A $32.5m copyright infringement lawsuit filed by DISH Network claims that CDN company DataCamp failed to prevent several pirate IPTV providers from pirating its content, even after receiving hundreds of DMCA notices. DataCamp has just informed the court that since it&#x27;s unable to monitor encrypted traffic, there is no liability and the lawsuit must be dismissed.

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it&#x27;s always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There&#x27;s no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Twitter account states we&#x27;ll learn more information later and that it will take &quot;some time&quot; before the system is finished. 
While that&#x27;s bad news for those who don&#x27;t own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There&#x27;s no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:

August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

                              <span>SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that Juri will join the roster of Street Fighter 6 alongside newcomer Kimberly.


Returning competitor Juri is a “sadistic thrill seeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes,” according to PlayStation. She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. 
For example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are new special moves but “…</span>

                              <span>Pirate streaming sites have plenty of options when it comes to sourcing movies, TV shows, and live TV streams. But for some, however, cheaper is apparently better. Streaming portals offering channels from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. and HBO are using Twitch&#x27;s servers to save money, but it appears Hollywood has already launched an investigation and is hot on the trail.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia&#x27;s unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game&#x27;s horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

                              <span>When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the &#x27;90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up&#x27;s Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art. You can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders go live at Arcade1Up&#x27;s official page.</span>

                              <span>I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!

The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob! There are rumors of massive layoffs at HBO Max to the tune of a 70% reduction in staff (thanks, The Wrap), as well as word that in-the-works projects like DC’s Supergirl movie will not be moving forward. Warner Bros. Discovery will roll HBO Max into Discovery&#x27;s streaming service, Discovery+, with less emphasis on premium scripted content fans of HBO Max have come to know and love, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

                              <span>Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it&#x27;s important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Wisdom from those who have tried opening a restaurant informs you that it isn’t the easiest way to make money. If Recipe for Disaster is any indication, running a successful eatery is a challenging, trial-and-error affair with plenty of stress and frustration, but one that, once mastered, offers excitement and gratification to balance it all out.
In this restaurant-management sim, you manage staff, monitor your business, and work to ensure your lights stay on. Hiring the right employees to develop a balanced team composition and designing a functional and visually appealing restaurant are i…</span>

                              <span>Top-tier football league LaLiga and subscription TV platform Movistar Plus+ have won a joint lawsuit in Spain that allows them to block IPTV services until 2025 without needing permission from the courts. A second lawsuit won by Movistar Plus+ allows the TV platform to advise local ISPs of piracy-facilitating sites on a weekly basis and have them blocked within three hours.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

                              <span>Ooblets, the long-in-development indie title that blends monster collecting, farming, and dancing, has gone Gold. That means the game has completed certifications for release, signaling that its impending 1.0 launch is fast approaching. 
Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today&#x27;s news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We&#x27;ve enjoyed Ooblets whenever we&#x27;ve checked in on it over the years, so it&#x27;s exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.</span>

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 received patch 1.90.375.1020 today, which has a short set of patch notes. One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

These are private homes where players can farm, build, and invite pals around to hang. Square Enix have shared a few new screenshots today showing the tropical paradise you&#x27;ll be constructing your homestead upon.

This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

The newie is Turbo Golf Racing, which looks like Rocket League for minigolf and is hitting Game Pass on the very day it launches. Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>I&#x27;m back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I&#x27;ve brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we&#x27;d like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Apex Legends: Hunted is soon to release, and leading the charge is Vantage - the youngest Legend ever inducted (or abducted) into the Apex Games. Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

                              <span>Seasonic is the name when it comes to reliable PC power supplies, so it&#x27;s rare to see big discounts - especially on their more affordable models.

No further details are available but with hundreds of millions of dollars in damages at stake, negotiations must have been tough.

                              <span>The Umbrella Corporation’s favourite stooge Albert Wesker is back again, and he’s bursting into multiplayer survival horror Dead By Daylight as a new killer, The Mastermind. Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors. Barricade yourself inside the police station of your mind and watch the trailer below.

Good news for them today then, because visual novel Hooked On You: A Dead By Daylight Dating Sim just surprise-launched exclusively on Steam. Watch the trailer below to see a more playful side to four of DBD’s serial killers, which isn’t something I ever thought I’d type.

                              <span>Puzzles are fun. Exploring floating islands is pretty boss too. That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight.

                              <span>Even if you’re not “into” PC gaming hardware, spend enough time in its orbit and you’ll eventually develop a healthy scepticism for a specific type of electro-trickery. The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

                              <span>Twitch has flagged Project Zomboid&#x27;s in-game police siren sound effect as copyright infringement. The platform muted a stream of a popular Spanish streamer who participated in a high-profile event. The game&#x27;s indie developers believe that there&#x27;s a copyright troll at work and advise gamers to stay away from emergency vehicles while they try to find a fix.

                              <span>Following in the footsteps of football leagues and boxing promotions, Canal+ has obtained a court order compelling local ISPs to block dozens of sites accused of illegally streaming Formula 1 events. The order is the latest in a long line of anti-piracy actions in France, where fledgling regulatory body Arcom has added hundreds of domains to the country&#x27;s official blacklist in just a few months.

Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six

Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
