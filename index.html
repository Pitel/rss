                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since there was a reason for players to get excited about a trace rifle in Destiny 2. However, the new Lodestar Exotic trace rifle from Episode: Heresy might be just the thing to rekindle that old love with the weapon type.


Destiny 2&#x27;s trace rifles had a bit of a heyday up into the Lightfall era. Back then, it was much easier to generate heavy ammo bricks when using two special ammo weapons. Trace rifles fit nicely as the &quot;primary&quot; special weapon, featuring large reserves. Those days wouldn&#x27;t stick around forever, though, and the guns fell by the wayside when Bungie retuned heavy ammo drops. Now, with a primary ammo trace rifle on the table, it might harken back to those old times.


Where does the Lodestar come from?

                              <span>Save some space.
Ahead of the release of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition next month, Nintendo has supposedly updated the file size of the Switch release.
Listings online previously suggested the game would take up around 15 GB of space and now the estimated file size on the Switch eShop says the game will require an installation of 13.4 GB (thanks, necrolipe). So it seems Monolith Soft and Nintendo have found a way to save some space! In comparison, the Wii U version was around 20+ GB all up.

Last week saw the arrival of Hello Kitty Island Adventure on the Nintendo Switch. Apart from featuring an all-star cast of Sanrio characters, the game takes a fair bit of inspiration from the Animal Crossing series while also freshening up the genre.
As more reviews have been published, we&#x27;ve now got a round up. Starting with ours here on Nintendo Life, we thought this was a &quot;great&quot; experience on the Switch - awarding it 8/10:

Well, here&#x27;s something we weren&#x27;t exactly expecting - Nintendo has today released a Switch eShop demo for Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.
This is the third time this game has been released, with the original version starting life on the Wii in 2010 before being ported across to the 3DS in 2013. You can grab the demo, which gives you access to three levels in the first world, right now. Game progress in this demo won&#x27;t be transferred across to the full game.

EA&#x27;s focus this week has been the reveal of the new &#x27;Battlefield Labs&#x27; in the leadup to the next major entry, but it&#x27;s not forgotten about its other FPS hit Apex Legends.
Unfortunately for EA, Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s free-to-play shooter has experienced a bit of a slump in recent times, with the &quot;business of that franchise&quot; not heading in the direction the company wants, according to EA&#x27;s CEO Andrew Wilson.

                              <span>Plenty of interesting names have been leaked to be present on Future Stars Team 2 in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team as we get closer to the release date.


It&#x27;s been known for some time that Future Stars will be a two-team affair. We already have the first team of special cards in packs, and EA Sports has introduced more items via SBCs and objectives. Like Team 1, Future Stars Team 2 will have special cards of both active footballers and Iconic Legends.


Full EA FC 25 Future Stars Team 2 (Leaked)


The leaks as of this writing might not be very high in number, but we have some exciting names. The community has been eagerly waiting for them, and these cards will be available as part of Team 2 events.



Pau Cubarsi


Amad Diallo


Samuel Eto&#x27;o


Rio Ferdinand


Garrincha


Aleksandar Pavlovic



All these items are expected to be available in packs, and more names are expected to appear as the release date approaches. 


EA FC 25 Future Stars Team 2 release date


The second team of cards will release on Friday, February 7. It&#x27;s the same day when the Team 1 cards are no longer going to be available in the packs, and they will be replaced by the Team 2 items. Once they release, you&#x27;ll have a week to try and get these items from your saved packs. Ultimately, packing the cards will depend on your luck, and you can also try out the store packs if required. 


Additionally, some of the promo items will be released as part of SBCs and objectives. Unlike pack items, you won&#x27;t need to rely on your luck to get them. Usually, they will have certain tasks you&#x27;ll need to complete. It will be interesting to find out which youngsters and former icons will find a place in the second team of the Future Stars promo.

With sweeping buffs across the Subclass, new Aspects, and a new keyword, Bolt Charge, to play with, it looks like Arc may be the strongest it has ever been for Heresy.


Of course, an individual Guardian&#x27;s experience may vary, which typically depends on the quality of a player&#x27;s build. If you know how to craft a setup that leans into what&#x27;s currently hot, you&#x27;ll have no problem playing with all of Destiny 2&#x27;s new Arc Subclass toys. If not, well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m here for.

Picking one of these choices gives you extra points in that skill, which can help later in the game.


One of the first instances of Henry needing to pick a specific dialogue option is around the campfire outside of Trosky Castle. Here, Henry, Lord Hans Capon, Oats, and your other comrades are swapping stories and getting some digs in while waiting for the sun to go down. During the middle of the dialogue, you can pick between one of four dialogue choices for Henry: Houndmaster, Stealth, Survival, or Scholarship.


So, the question is, which is the best one to pick for the long run in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2?

In particular, you may have run into a quest involving a cabbage thief that&#x27;s caused some trouble. Here&#x27;s where to find this leafy thief.


How to start the Cabbage Thief quest in KCD2


You can start the Cabbage Thief quest by speaking to Bailiff Thrush in Troskowitz. Since this mission is considered a free-roam objective, there won&#x27;t be a waypoint for this character. Based on my experience, he tends to roam around this village, so try to look out for his yellowish clothing. You may also greet him during the Bad Blood quest, which will place a marker on his location.

Where has Pavlena gone, and what can you do to find her? Figuring this out is part of a side mission, Bad Blood, in which Bozhena asks you to discover her whereabouts. Here&#x27;s a complete guide on the Bad Blood quest in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.

                              <span>In Path of Exile 2, damage conversion is a crucial mechanic that allows players to modify their skills&#x27; damage types, enhancing their effectiveness in different builds. With multiple damage types in the game, understanding how to convert one into another can lead to powerful build optimizations, which you may find quite useful.


How Path of Exile 2 Damage Conversion Works


Whether you&#x27;re using passive skill nodes, unique items, or support gems, knowing how to manipulate damage types can drastically change how your skills function. Most Skills in Path of Exile 2 deal multiple of them at once, influenced by numerous in-game mechanics. Most abilities do not deal a single damage type; instead, they often convert a large percentage of Physical damage into an elemental type while retaining som…</span>

How to cure Food Poisoning


You can cure Food Poisoning by consuming a Digestive Potion. This one-time-use consumable will cure Food Poisoning entirely, decrease your Nourishment by 20, and increase your Vitality stat by one for 10 minutes. Consuming the Digestive Potion will immediately remove the Food Poisoning debuff, so the faster you get one in you, the less damage Food Poisoning will do.


There are several ways to obtain a Digestive Potion. If you have been leveling your Alchemy, you can eventually learn to brew your own Dig…</span>

                              <span>Balachko is a special Pyro Fatui Agent in the Natlan region of Genshin Impact. As a Local Legend, Balachko is a miniboss with greatly increased health and damage compared to most overworld enemies. Three achievements are associated with defeating this shady figure, so let’s get to work.


Where to find Local Legend Balachko


Balachko can be found near the People of the Springs, in the cave to the left of the Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits domain. There are a few tribal enemies in a camp. Defeat all the enemies to clear the way and unlock a Precious Chest. Balachko is behind a locked gate that requires two Keys to Somewhere to open.

The event was officially leaked online, and if the rumors are true, it will be a two-week fiesta for the players. For now, you&#x27;ll need to contend with the missions that are part of the first week.


Fallout 76 Science of Love event dates


Week 1 began earlier on February 4 at 12 a.m. ET, and it will be continuing until February 11 at 11:59 p.m. ET. Once the first week is over, the next set of weekly quests will be available, and you&#x27;ll have until February 18 to complete all the quests.


With the dates in check, let&#x27;s take a look at how you can complete all the quests.

Getting visitors to your island is often as simple as decorating a Cabin in a certain way, but some require more forethought. Milk, for instance, requires you to have befriended several other rare visitors, while other visitors will only appear at certain times. 


It&#x27;s worth trying to get as many visitors to your island as possible, even if it means switching out the decor of each cabin between months, because each visitor will reward you with certain items in return for talking to them.

Dumornay is the latest entrant to the Future Stars promo, and you can choose between two versions. Both cards might look similar, but there are noticeable differences. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can complete the challenge, and which version you should pick for your team. 


EA FC 25 Melchie Dumornay Future Stars SBC tasks


The Melchie Dumornay Future Stars SBC has two tasks, and here are the requirements. 


Task 1 - 84-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Melchie Dumornay Future Stars SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a set of solution you can use to complete the full SBC in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - 84-Rated Squad



Any 10 84-rted items


Any 1 83-rated item



Task 2 - 85-Rated Squad



Koopmeiners 83


Joao Cancelo 86


Fishlock 83


Palmer 85


Gwinn 83


Claudia Pina 83


Little 86


Spitse 83


Gabriel 86


Locatelli 83


Xhaka 86



The choice here is simple: go with the one with the Press Proven+ playstyle. Since the other item has Relentless+, we can safely ignore it. The 89-rated Striker item can also operate as a CM, and she has 3 roles+. The card also features Finesse Shot, Power Shot, Technical, Incisive Pass, and Quick Step.


While the price of the SBC is pretty low, the cards on offer could have better. They don&#x27;t have 2 playstyle+, and most players will already have better cards in their Ultimate Team squads.

                              <span>The map in Hello Kitty Island Adventure is absolutely massive, filled with nooks and crannies to explore that hold secrets waiting to be discovered. The initial map is expansive enough, but there are also new areas to unlock as you progress. 


Merry Meadow is one of these new areas, which can only be unlocked as you progress into the mid-game stages. It’s filled with secrets, new resources, and a lot of plots where you will eventually be able to plant and breed flowers. If you want to know how to find this lush, floral area and unlock its full potential, keep reading.

                              <span>Arrowhead Games has delivered the first big patch for Helldivers 2, which reintroduces emoting while flying, addresses the Dog Breath stratagem, and fixes bugs. The patch also secretly added new undocumented items to Helldivers 2, such as a shovel and a bug hole for Bile Titan spawns.


Helldivers 2 patch 01.002.101 brings a host of changes to the game. It increases the amount of starting and spare magazines by one, lets you toss grenades and stratagems from the FRV, and introduces several fixes to the maligned &quot;Guard Dog&quot; Dog Breath stratagem. Arrowhead announced in the patch notes that it&#x27;s leaving the Siege Ready Armor Passive bug alone, and will merely change the description for it later.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known for some time now that Capcom&#x27;s next flagship release, Monster Hunter: Wilds, may be a pain in the butt to run. The previous beta wasn&#x27;t performant at all, and though Capcom has performed some optimizations since the new set of hardware requirements doesn&#x27;t give me much hope.


I haven&#x27;t been hiding my annoyance at how hard to run Capcom&#x27;s more recent RPGs have been, and so I was hoping that the team would manage to do some black magic to make Monster Hunter: Wilds easier to run. Thing is, it doesn&#x27;t seem like Capcom&#x27;s been able to do much in this respect after all, because the new set of system requirements is a real disappointment. The bottom line is that we should generally expect it to run more or less the same as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 did. Poorly, in other words.

                              <span>After a few years of waiting, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 dropped, and it seems to be doing pretty well for itself. In the midst of thousands of players stepping back into the boots of Henry, developer Warhorse Studios has been getting praise from one of the industry&#x27;s biggest names.


In a recent post on X, CD Projekt Red posted to its Witcher account to wish congratulations on the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The heartfelt message also wishes for your blade to &quot;always be sharp,&quot; and is accompanied by a friendly image of Geralt of Rivia embracing young Henry in what I can only describe as something the cool kids may refer to as some sort of &quot;bromance.&quot; Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, obviously.




Warhorse itself posted a response under this post, thanking CDPR for the kudos, adding that the team was &quot;raising a glass to you now.&quot;


Kingdom Come: Johnny Silverhand edition


Interpret it as some sort of corporate publicity thing if you will, but it is quite nice to see some of gaming&#x27;s biggest studios giving props when new titles come out. It probably helps that The Witcher and Kingdom Come series both have similar vibes and aesthetics. Watch out for a mod that plops Geralt right into the heart of Bohemia [citation needed].


As mentioned above, Deliverance 2 has been doing pretty well within the last 24 hours. According to recent data from SteamDB – which tracks all things related to Steam – the game peaked at nearly 160,000 players since yesterday. At the time of writing, about 130,000 Henries (plural) are adventuring.


By the way, if it&#x27;s been a while since you played the original or you&#x27;re completely new to the series (as I am), the studio very handily put out of Story Recap video recently. That should bring you up to speed before you go diving straight into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

That said, I have to admit that the new Nether activity feels awesome, and most of the community seems to agree.


There have been hints and murmurs about the potential quality of Destiny 2: Malice, granted. I very nearly fell off the Destiny ride myself a little while back: a decision that was only supported by the fact that Destiny 2: Revenant wasn&#x27;t all that good. Thankfully, Malice is kicking things off with a bang, and Nether is currently the rather excellent capstone to the whole thing. In the broadest sense possible, The Nether is a kind of a mash-up between the Menagerie and The Coil, with a tiny bit of Onslaught thrown in for good measure…</span>

Betrayer Trait Quest in Verse Piece



Betrayer quest NPC on the Lost Isle

                              <span>The monthly beat-down of Team Rocket&#x27;s leaders has become one of the greatest joys of playing Pokémon Go. Cliff is one of the easier members of the current Team Rocket administration to take on, but he can still trouble you. Here’s how to defeat Cliff in Pokémon Go in January 2025.


How to defeat Cliff in Pokémon GO 


Cliff is essentially a slab of muscle, as are his bulky Pokémon. But don’t think you need a strategy to bring him down. To find Cliff in Pokémon Go, you must use a Rocket Radar to narrow down his location. Defeat Team Rocket Grunts, marked with a Team Rocket balloon, and collect six Mysterious Components to create the device.


You can then use the Rocket Radar to show Cliff&#x27;s whereabouts on the map. Like other bosses, he can appear at PokéStops or Team Rocket balloons. Oth…</span>

The new system will be music to the ears of those who hated the grind system of the Revenant Episode. Back then, we had the Tonic system, which was awful to describe in one word. It confused me every time when I looked at it, and the ratio of resources to rewards was plain unfair. The Tome of Want system is a noticeable improvement, and here&#x27;s how you can utilize it to get drops from the Heretic Arsenal.

Well, friend, the Servants of Freedom Warbond for Helldivers 2 is what you need. And as you secure freedom for everyone on Super Earth, you can take as many of those undemocratic bastards with you.


The Helldivers 2: Servants of Freedom Warbond is coming this week on February 6, and it should provide plenty of bang for your buck. For the first time, you can choose what strategic target should be dusted by a Hellbomb. The Premium Warbond introduces the B-100 Portable Hellbomb backpack, which you or an ally can activate. Once you do, you have a 10-second countdown before the fireworks begin. You can drop the bomb at any objective or wade into a horde of enemies for one last send-off.

                              <span>Having man&#x27;s best friend by your side in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has several advantages, and you can find Henry&#x27;s trusted companion Mutt pretty early.


In fact, you start looking for the dog as soon as you gain access to the open world. Mutt will be separated after being attacked at the camp, so the onus is on you to find him. You can fast-track this process by going to the spot where Mutt hides post the attack and it will allow you to add him to your party quicker. 


Mutt&#x27;s location in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2


To find Mutt, you&#x27;ll have to travel to the northwest part of Semine, and the spot is close to the river. Just take he road from Semine, and you&#x27;ll reach a point from where the road takes you to the forest. Mutt is actually near a wolf cave, and you can find in southwest of the Nomad&#x27;s Camp. Hence, you can also quick travel to Nomad&#x27;s Camp and start your journey from there. Either way, the key is to head into the forest. 


Once you approach the cave, you&#x27;ll find Mutt whining, and being surrounded by a wolves. You&#x27;ll have to save him from the wolves, and this quest also serves as the tutorial towards how you can command your dog to perform certain actions. You can choose to flee, but the wolves are pretty easy to dispose off, and you&#x27;ll gain XP in the process of doing so. 




Just press your your L1/LB button to look for Mutt, and you&#x27;ll get to interact with him, feed him, or send him to your home. 


You can also find Mutt while completing the Invaders side quest. This quest allows you to interact with the Cumans, and Henry will follow Vasko&#x27;s trail up the hill. If you keep following the quest objective, you&#x27;ll be led directly to the cave. You&#x27;ll again come across the same cutscene and set of actions, but the fight will be harder as it will be night and Henry will be drunk. Hence, the first method is the recommended route you should take in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

The collapse of the Fmovies empire and the conviction of a person linked to a major IPTV provider, marked rare progress in a difficult region. Yet, increasing doubts over what happens next in Vietnam has sparked concerns that not even the biggest wins offer guaranteed progression.

                              <span>A fitting farewell.
We love it when a studio demonstrates significant growth and improvement with each of its subsequent projects. With Bombservice specifically, the team has always boasted a strong understanding of what makes Metroidvanias ‘click’, and with Momodora: Moonlit Farewell, it’s delivered what may well be its finest game yet.
The latest chronological entry in the series, Moonlit Farewell is a noticeable step up from its already-excellent predecessor, Reverie Under the Moonlight, in terms of scope, visual design, and gameplay. Right from the start, you’re greeted by stunning scenes of pixel-art wizardry, with Bombservice showcasing its mastery of colour and atmosphere. This extends to the characters and enemies, with each and every bizarre creature feeling both alien in design and yet perfectly suited to Momodora’s ethereal world.

Nintendo recently released its latest financial update for the third quarter of FY2025 and, as most of us had probably expected, numbers are down across the board as the Switch lumbers towards its ninth year on the market.
Had Nintendo released such figures several years ago – in which operating profit was down a staggering 46.7% – you&#x27;d imagine that investors would begin to panic and Nintendo&#x27;s share price would experience a bit of a tumble (just look at EA&#x27;s recent downturn to see evidence of this).

Takaya Imamura, the legendary ex-Nintendo dev perhaps best known for his work on the Star Fox franchise, received an early gig at the company working on The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES.
In an interview with Edge magazine (thanks, GamesRadar+), however, he apparently wasn&#x27;t particularly keen to work on the title, and would have preferred to enjoy playing the final build as a fan.

                              <span>Steam early access games that haven&#x27;t been updated in a long while will now be more prominently labelled as such, according to reports. As noticed by third-party tracking platform SteamDB, Valve have begun adding warnings to early access info boxes, making it harder to accidentally spend your pocket money on a promising project that hasn&#x27;t advanced in years.

                              <span>When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a &quot;weaver band&quot;, a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

                              <span>Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

Summarised as a &quot;slice of life tamagotchi&quot; and available in Spanish and English, it&#x27;s a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It&#x27;s free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody&#x27;s one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have &quot;overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem.&quot; We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t end up covering as many classic point and click adventures as I&#x27;d like on RPS. That&#x27;s a real shame, because every time I play a good one, I&#x27;m reminded how much magic the genre still has. Developer Blyts (Kelvin And The Infamous Machine) was kind enough to send me over a key for Slender Threads, which is out this Friday. My opinion as a complete non-expert on the genre?

                              <span>Call me a cynic if you must, but I&#x27;m generally sceptical when someone claims to be &quot;the greatest swordsman of all demons&quot;. It&#x27;s the sort of boast most demon swordsman like to trot out, in my experience. And yet! I have to admit that this Gogandantess lad has a real flourish to him. He&#x27;s going places, I reckon. Chief among those places being PC at some point in 2025, and he&#x27;s bringing the rest of Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny with him. Catch him showing off in the below trailer.

Gosh, Shuhei Yoshida has really brought us the Nintendo goods today, huh? On the latest episode of the Minnmax podcast, the former PlayStation executive began to reminisce about the early days of his time at Sony, recalling the time that he got to play the company&#x27;s first title for the fabled &#x27;SNES PlayStation&#x27; — the CD-ROM expansion that never saw the light of day.
We&#x27;re sure you already know the story, but briefly, Nintendo had agreed to work with Sony on the SNES&#x27; disk expansion, but the Big N secretly went behind the partner&#x27;s back and announced its intentions to work with Phillips just moments before Sony would unveil the console.

Updated with Laika: Aged Through Blood and Blade Chimera. Enjoy!

The word &#x27;Metroidvania&#x27; might rub some the wrong way, but it&#x27;s a useful catch-all to describe a very specific type of search-action game experience. Combining elements from both the Metroid series and Koji Igarashi-produced Castlevania titles, this broad platforming genre has you using an ever-growing skill set to open up new paths across an expansive, layered map.

                              <span>It was always bound to happen.
Earlier today, Nintendo released its latest quarterly financial update for FY2025 and the findings were... much as you might expect. Sure, Switch crossed the big 150 million units milestone, but Nintendo also lowered its sales forecast for the second quarter in a row as interest continues to drop.
Now, you might assume that the drop in Switch sales is a natural product of Switch 2 anticipation — we officially know that the console is coming this year, after all — but, as Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors shortly after the report was published, you can&#x27;t put all the blame on hardware hype (thanks, Eurogamer).

Speaking with press as Nintendo released its latest financial data, Furukawa was asked how the company would adequately prepare for the Switch 2 launch in light of its predecessor&#x27;s history with stock shortages and resellers.

With last month&#x27;s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo teased something we&#x27;d all been waiting for (well, following weeks of leaks) — a potential &#x27;mouse&#x27; mode. A little sneak peek at the optical laser, the Joy-Con swiftly rolling along a surface like a mouse.
There are a few obvious candidates for games that&#x27;d work wonders with a mouse controller, but the most apparent is next week&#x27;s new release, Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII. So trust the folks over at IGN to ask developer Firaxis about its thoughts on the potential feature in an interview.

Developer G.Rev may not be all that familiar to those who weren’t fully immersed in the shoot-&#x27;em-up scene of the early noughties. A boutique independent, it was assembled by former Taito employees who previously contributed to the likes of RayStorm and G-Darius. G.Rev’s most famous work, and the one that put it on the map, is Border Down: a wonderfully original 2003 shooting game for Sega’s Naomi arcade hardware and Dreamcast console. It was followed in 2006 by Under Defeat, switching from the horizontal to the vertical and trading sci-fi for a grounded militaristic theme.
Not to be confused with that other Dreamcast helicopter shoot &#x27;em up, Psikyo’s Zero Gunner 2, Under Defeat pits pink-haired German soldier girls against the enemy forces of “The Union”.

Following reports that PlatinumGames — the studio behind the Bayonetta series, Astral Chain, and who helped Square Enix on NieR:Automata — had lost several key directors and creators back in December 2024, former vice president Hideki Kamiya appears to have confirmed that at least five directors have left the company.
Earlier today, Kamiya, who directed the original Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101 before leaving Platinum in October 2023, published a new YouTube video on his personal channel (thanks VGC), where he largely responds to comments from fans.

Víme jistě, že Intel plánuje další, což potvrzuje změna v kódu v rámci Mesa, která přidává nová PCI device ID nad rámec již existujících, z nichž jedno nese přímo shodný popisek BMG G21 a celkový počet tohoto ID tak vzrůstá na pět.</span>

                              <span>Warhorse&#x27;s medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It&#x27;s an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra&#x27;s tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. 


In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I&#x27;ve encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2&#x27;s eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

                              <span>Several hours in, it’s become apparent that I lack the patience for much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s much-publicised historical accuracies, like needing to bathe yourself every six minutes or how 15th century Bohemians can take several consecutive sword swings to the neck without dying. Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry&#x27;s Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry&#x27;s short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called Grab Them By The Eyes.

                              <span>Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty&#x27;s Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I&#x27;m not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That&#x27;s a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he&#x27;s &quot;hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,&quot; write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

                              <span>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) covered the announcement for Forgotlings back in 2023. It&#x27;s a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind Forgotton Anne - one of my favourites from 2018. Forgotlings, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a Steam demo. This is such good news I&#x27;ve basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.

                              <span>I was initially sceptical that we&#x27;d be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game&#x27;s creator Venris on YouTube. He&#x27;s co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around &quot;eight to 12 hours a day&quot;, though, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as &quot;Darkest Dungeon, but you&#x27;re running the dungeon&quot;. That&#x27;s better than anything I could come up with, so let&#x27;s stick with that.

Because I&#x27;m basically taking the bait just by writing about it, aren&#x27;t I? &quot;The last carrier bag you’ll ever need,&quot; begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium&#x27;s protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet&#x27;s local off-licence. &quot;Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets.&quot;
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt&#x27;s taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM&#x27;s collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They&#x27;ve previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi&#x27;s jacket. I&#x27;m not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn&#x27;t afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let&#x27;s try and keep an open mind about this. The bag&#x27;s Dyneema fabric &quot;is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials&quot;.

                              <span>I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was Roots Devour - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.

A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka&#x27;d buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it&#x27;s a lot of producers talking a big game about &quot;levelling up&quot; the &quot;core experience&quot;, which seems to remain blasting a building you don&#x27;t like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game&#x27;s actual running and/or gunning.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He&#x27;s a blacksmith&#x27;s son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn&#x27;t have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn&#x27;t be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it&#x27;s more than her job&#x27;s worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she&#x27;s dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

                              <span>There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called &quot;the piss filter&quot; and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there&#x27;s at least one developer who is reviving &quot;smeared dirt&quot; as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

In 2024, over 500,000 websites were subjected to blocking measures, pushing the all-time site blocking total to more than 1.8 million. While VPNs also face blocking, the task isn&#x27;t always straightforward. The data shows that sales sites in Russia prefer to expose IP addresses owned by foreign companies, located outside Russia.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no ideal time to promote a blocking system that by design restricts freedom and, for the vast majority of citizens, offers no tangible benefit. Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA&#x27;s export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

                              <span>The future of AI innovation may hinge on the outcome of a global copyright debate.  In the U.S., rightsholders are taking a hard line, pursuing legal action against AI companies that utilize copyrighted works without permission.  However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in &#x27;pirate&#x27; libraries. This &#x27;copyright schism&#x27; could have far-reaching consequences.

                              <span>Musi&#x27;s initial attempt to force Apple to reinstate its music app to the App Store has failed. A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It&#x27;s the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

                              <span>The post-launch update and DLC schedule for Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII slightly discombobulates me, because the image above is weirdly reminiscent of Civ 7&#x27;s own historical Age progression screens. But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke &quot;all roadmaps lead to Rome&quot;.* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

                              <span>The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are &quot;disappointing someone&quot;. Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

                              <span>Hidden away on NASA&#x27;s Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out &quot;the vast sorrows and all the vexations&quot; of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I&#x27;m well aware that &quot;2.5D&quot; and &quot;Soulsvania&quot; are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every &#x27;vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It&#x27;s a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can&#x27;t - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game&#x27;s compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

                              <span>Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of &quot;turning towards the future&quot;. It dreamed of &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;. Nowhere in the post did the word &quot;layoffs&quot; appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: &quot;we don’t require support from the full studio.&quot; 
It&#x27;s one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of our &quot;favourite&quot; mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically &quot;sunsetted&quot; rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

                              <span>The last Minesweeperalike I wrote up was a sparkling slurry of mind-altering pop-ups and resinous AI cleavage. It was David Cronenberg&#x27;s Minesweeper: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I&#x27;d put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It&#x27;s Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.

                              <span>The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;, as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they&#x27;re looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay&#x27;s recent blog about BioWare&#x27;s future, but he comments only that they&#x27;re &quot;taking the opportunity to reimagine&quot; how BioWare operate between projects, and &quot;have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.&quot; Which is a very slippery way to say that you&#x27;re making a load of people redundant.

                              <span>Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

                              <span>Looks like they finally got the message. &quot;An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC,&quot; said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It&#x27;s been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn&#x27;t seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they&#x27;ve now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

                              <span>A new report from consultancy firm Mediavision provides data on IPTV piracy that the Swedish government didn&#x27;t want to hear. Between spring and fall of 2024, illegal subscriptions increased by a record 25%, with an estimated 700,000 households now regularly paying to pirate. The government considers a &#x27;viewing ban&#x27; for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

                              <span>Pirate site blocking orders are a step closer to becoming reality in the United States after Rep. Zoe Lofgren introduced the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act earlier today. Should it become law, FAPDA would allow rightsholders to obtain site blocking orders targeted at verified pirate sites, presumably run by foreign operators. The blocking orders would apply to both ISPs and DNS resolvers. The latter is a novelty.

Official updates have been sparse, but according to a new message posted by the operators, they&#x27;re having trouble paying the bills. Further details are lacking, but the call for help resulted in a healthy stream of crypto donations, which will be of interest to anti-piracy groups too.

That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build &#x27;n&#x27; crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There&#x27;s good reason to trust the developers&#x27; ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it&#x27;s all core, no loop.

                              <span>Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That&#x27;s a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You&#x27;ll wish you&#x27;d been dusted by nuclear fire when you&#x27;re being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line&#x27;s headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there&#x27;s now a demo available via the developer Discord.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll have to bear with me for this one, because the press release we received for Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked contains about an 86/14 split between scrambled hypeguff and actual tangible information. In brief, it&#x27;s a VR collaboration between D&amp;D traffickers Wizards Of The Coast and Demeo studio Resolution Games that aims to simulate a tactical co-op tabletop experience without any of the boring bits, like seeing your mates&#x27; genuine reactions to things or having your frigid digitised soul warmed at the hearth of human kinship. Here is - in a sense of the word so loose I fear imminent smiting by a bellicose scribe god for typing it - a trailer:

                              <span>Nic says that RPG remake sequel Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is &quot;uneven, unfocused, and unmissable&quot;. You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

                              <span>Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

                              <span>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of the 2016 launch version of No Man&#x27;s Sky, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it&#x27;s only getting more and more, er, infinite.

                              <span>Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody&#x27;s finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who&#x27;ve been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who&#x27;ve grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what&#x27;s this, there&#x27;s a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sniper At Work is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for &quot;soothing merge-2 experiences&quot; featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only &quot;twos&quot; you shall be &quot;merging&quot; in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only &quot;cherries&quot; you shall be &quot;picking&quot; are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that &quot;soothing&quot; - I won&#x27;t judge. I will only repeat Nic&#x27;s observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look &quot;a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman&quot;, which I would translate to &quot;my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here&quot;. Right, that&#x27;s enough quotation marks for one article. There won&#x27;t be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this immersive sim offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone&#x27;s car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I&#x27;m still messed up about it, honestly.

                              <span>A Nintendo lawsuit filed last November targeted video gamer Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru. Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn&#x27;t read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo&#x27;s legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

                              <span>The use of copyrighted material in training large language models (LLMs) has sparked legal battles and takedown notices. In the Netherlands, anti-piracy group BREIN takes credit for forcing the popular &#x27;GEITje&#x27; LLM offline, which in part was trained on copyrighted texts. The developer didn&#x27;t necessarily agree with BREIN, but lacked the resources to fight back.

I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob&#x27;s amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

                              <span>The Sims and The Sims 2 are getting digital PC versions with all their original expansion packs included, and should be released by the end of the week, say Kotaku. The report follows teases made by the official Sims account on X as part of a 25th anniversary celebrations roadmap, as well as a few other scattered hints in various bits of promo as collated by Redditor skyline7284. &quot;According to a source familiar with the plans, both games will be released digitally on PC later this week,&quot; write Kotaku.

I&#x27;ve had a play of the Steam demo now, and am happy to report that it&#x27;s still very beautiful, and also that I still have hands: an incredible victory on all counts.

This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They&#x27;ve also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the &#x27;Emergence Day&#x27; of the title referring to the insectoid Locust&#x27;s first visit above ground.

It&#x27;s sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it&#x27;s nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that&#x27;s launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it&#x27;s inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They&#x27;re letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

                              <span>Look up, planet-lubber. Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It&#x27;s the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

                              <span>Today I learned about balut, a street food of the Philippines. It&#x27;s a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I&#x27;m too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I&#x27;m not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot. There is talk on the radio of dangerous folk out at night...

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we&#x27;re getting Team Ninja&#x27;s Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I&#x27;d do a bit about stealth drops but I&#x27;m at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here&#x27;s a trailer:

                              <span>I reckon you&#x27;re likely to be in one of two camps with precision platformer Bauhaus Bonk - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word &quot;bopping&quot; -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It&#x27;s a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don&#x27;t know the name of so I&#x27;m just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can&#x27;t really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I&#x27;m not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

Like the 2000&#x27;s themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment.

                              <span>Continuing last week&#x27;s Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don&#x27;t act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It&#x27;s yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don&#x27;t want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week&#x27;s new PC games instead.

                              <span>Doom is back, and this time it’s bringing its signature blend of demon-slaying chaos and heavy-metal energy to medieval times. Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5—unless you’re eyeing one of the pricier editions, which grant early access starting May 13. Naturally, our attention is on the PC edition and, of course, where to get it for the best price.

                              <span>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: &quot;person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it&quot;.  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

                              <span>A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

                              <span>If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don&#x27;t make the rules, that&#x27;s just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad &quot;paintress&quot; who&#x27;s magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We&#x27;ve been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It&#x27;s too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you&#x27;ll make it.

Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don&#x27;t Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.


It&#x27;s out in early access today. Yes, they&#x27;ve sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

                              <span>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US&#x27; Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

I&#x27;d say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I&#x27;m going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for &quot;tweaks to the weapons upgrade system&quot;. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>We called Amplitude&#x27;s fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn&#x27;t dimmed with age. &quot;The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly,&quot; breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. &quot;It&#x27;s a simply splendid game.&quot; Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso&#x27;s frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier&#x27;s name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it&#x27;s through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they&#x27;ve just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here&#x27;s the announcement trailer.

                              <span>Typical, really. I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words &quot;awesome&quot;, &quot;slaughter&quot;, &quot;core pillars&quot;, and &quot;iPod&quot; more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here&#x27;s a list of every detail I found interesting that isn&#x27;t already covered in the showcase.

Trailered at this evening&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, it releases for PC in fall 2025, and they&#x27;re working on it in collaboration with Bayonetta and Nier: Automata devs Platinum Games. All of which very much tickles my dismemberable gizzards. Here&#x27;s the reveal video.

If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective RPG Disco Elysium. It was an &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus&quot;-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.
Before that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed &quot;psychogeographic RPG&quot; from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it&#x27;s called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can &quot;pre-register&quot; for here, should you wish. Here&#x27;s the sell:

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would&#x27;ve liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there&#x27;s a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I&#x27;ve now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there&#x27;s a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn&#x27;t quite work for me.

                              <span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is billed as a faithful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, with an open world setting derived from primary sources and historical consultancy that seeks to &quot;challenge misconceptions&quot;, but I&#x27;m enjoying it partly for the inconsistencies. As I amble into a random village, my eye is caught by what feel like carefully observed period flourishes: a particular arrangement of crops in a sloping field, a woman praying at a shrine by the gate. Some of these sights and sounds unlock codex entries, layering up the pedagogic texture.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

                              <span>Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you&#x27;ve already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

                              <span>In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth&#x27;s computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow&#x27;s Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game &quot;will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story...&quot; Witchy hackers? I&#x27;m in.

                              <span>Some eager beavers who bought the GeForce RTX 4090 at launch were, quite infamously, rewarded for their investment with a defective power adapter, one that that could melt the plastic in their £1679 graphics card like it was Ronald Lacey’s face. Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.

                              <span>Back in December, a bunch of cool games had the extreme impoliteness to sneak onto digital shelves while we were losing our hair, souls and marbles covering various gaming award shows. One of those games was Escape From Castle Matsumoto - which can be excused, admittedly, because it&#x27;s a game about ninjas, and we expect ninjas to be sneaky.

The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn&#x27;t, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something &quot;bigger and better&quot; than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t get out. I&#x27;m trapped in a tractor full of beer and spare tires. I haven&#x27;t taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor&#x27;s wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. &quot;Sink or swim!&quot; yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

                              <span>The high-end prebuilt PC market is a battleground for premium prices, but catching a solid deal can save you a significant chunk of change. Case in point: Dell is offering the Alienware Aurora R16 GeForce RTX 4090 gaming PC for $2,899.99, a full $1,000 off the usual price. It&#x27;s a rare sight to see an RTX 4090 gaming rig dip below the $3,000 mark, especially given the recent uptick in standalone GPU prices.

                              <span>This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn&#x27;t spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot&#x27;s The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn&#x27;t want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn&#x27;t kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It&#x27;s all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It&#x27;s a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like &quot;it would be properly shit if I died right now because I&#x27;d really like to see how this pans out&quot;. A personal &#x27;never kill yourself&#x27; moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

                              <span>In the UK, May has hitherto been a month of innocent delight and sacred observance, with no less than two bank holidays. On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers&#x27; Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.
Which is to say, it&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll get to play id Software&#x27;s cacodemon-booping FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct.

                              <span>Halo has a history of embracing wacky game modes, and Halo Infinite players are seeing that tradition continue this week with a new playlist of game modes. &quot;Action Sack&quot; is a returning playlist for the series. It first appeared in Halo 3 as a rotating set of modes that would see you quickly cycling through various deadly minigames, from chaotic rockets-only nukefests to panicky punch-ups with ammoless pistols. This time, the playlist includes a familiar geometric hazard that has seen the death of many a bean: the &quot;hex-a-gone&quot; level from Fall Guys.
