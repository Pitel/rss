                              <span>A Quiet Place: Day One has hit theaters, bringing us back to the day the sound-sensitive &quot;Death Angels&quot; arrived on Earth. Like many A Quiet Place fans, I walked into the theater with questions, the foremost of which was whether A Quiet Place: Day One would have a post-credits scene.


Do you need to wait for a post-credits scene?




I&#x27;m here to tell you that A Quiet Place: Day One does not have a post-credit scene. You don&#x27;t need to worry about missing a jaw-dropping reveal if you don’t want to sit through the credits. I always try to go through a movie&#x27;s credits to show my support to the cast and crew who worked to bring it to life, but I understand that sometimes you don&#x27;t have the time to do that.


A Quiet Place: Day One&#x27;s lack of a post-credits scene continues a franchise trend

One of many options you can use is the Piggy Bank, a premium feature that gives you hundreds, potentially thousands, of dice for a cost.


How does the Piggy Bank work in Monopoly GO?


Monopoly GO&#x27;s Piggy Bank is a limited-time special offer that allows you to get dice in exchange for real money. Once it starts, it&#x27;s usually available for around six to seven days, giving you nearly a whole week to collect dice and decide if you want to open the bank as a one-time boost. You fill the piggy bank by rolling doubles as you travel around your Monopoly board.


 However, there are a few peculiar features of this piggy bank. The main caveat is that it costs mone…</span>

Relentless combo chains are probably the most-bemoaned aspect of encounter design in the DLC, but I have come to sing the praises of our friend, our granter-of-damage, our savior: the Deflecting Hardtear. 


Where to get the Deflecting Hardtear


This is very easy to find, and very early in the DLC. The first Furnace Golem you see in the Land of Shadow will drop the Deflecting Hardtear when defeated. Defeating it is just a matter of walking up and whacking its tootsies until it &quot;stance breaks&quot; three times, at which point it will fall to the ground primed for a high damage punish to its face.

                              <span>A new anime adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s genre-shaping, gender-bending action-comedy manga Ranma 1/2 is in the works. Details are sparse, but it looks like a new Ranma project has officially been locked in.


The announcement for the new Ranma 1/2 anime dropped on the official X/Twitter account of Takahashi which, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t translate directly. Fortunately, reputable manga news reporter @MangaReporter did just that, confirming that the show is in development and that we&#x27;ll learn more about it at a live event scheduled to launch on July 17th at 6 P.M. Japanese Standard Time (JPT).




For those who might not remember the manga, Ranma 1/2 follows Akane Tendo, a tomboyish martial artist who discovers that her fiancée, Ranma Saotome, suffers from a curse that causes him to transform into a girl whenever cold water hits him. Two anime adaptations of the series were made, with the first lasting only a few episodes. The second series, which aired between 1989 and 1993, proved much more successful and is still highly regarded by shonen fans today.


A Rumiko renaissance

This new Ranma 1/2 anime may follow in the footsteps of some exceptional anime remakes based on Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s work. David Productions&#x27; remake of Urusei Yatsura&#x27;s anime gave the series some much-needed updates, modernizing the series&#x27; setting and adjusting elements of the story that haven&#x27;t aged well. Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon also helped pave the way for Ranma 1/2, re-introducing anime fans to Inuyasha.


We don&#x27;t know anything else about what the new Ranma 1/2 anime will change about its source material, or if it will change anything. However, I feel it will be good if Urusei Yatsura is anything to go off of.

                              <span>A new trailer for Deadpool and Wolverine has been released, and it revealed the return of Tyler Mane as Sabretooth. The former WWE wrestler portrayed Sabretooth in the first X-Men movie.


Deadpool sets up the hype in the trailer for a Wolverine and Sabretooth fight, since the last time Hugh Jackman and Tyler Mane locked horns as Wolverine and Sabretooth was 24 years ago. Wolverine against Sabretooth has been a regular match-up in the comics. Similar to Wolverine, Sabretooth has regenerative capabilities and also has sharp claws to aid him in battles. 




Apart from the Sabretooth introduction, the trailer mostly featured clips from scenes that have already been featured in previous trailers. The new trailer outlines a rough sketch of why Deadpool and Wolverine are teaming up. Deadpool explains in the trailer that he is about to lose his world, with the Time Variance Authority most likely having a part to play in it.


The TVA is tasked with pruning alternate timelines, and after the post-credit scenes of Deadpool 2, there are branching timelines created by Deadpool which they’ll probably have to come in and fix. We also see Alioth during the trailer, the creature who first appeared in the Loki series. Given that Alioth exists in the Void, the fight with Sabretooth might be taking place there too.


It has also been revealed that the Wolverine we see in the movie comes from a timeline where he could not save his people, or as Mr. Paradox puts it in the trailer, “This Wolverine let down his entire world.” So, there’s a redemption arc in the making for Wolverine.


Deadpool and Wolverine will hit theatres on July 26, 2024.

                              <span>Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment’s free-to-play battle royale game, offers unique Heirloom weapons for most of its playable Legends. There are 26 Legends in Apex as of Season 21, and 19 of them have a Heirloom weapon available in the game.


What are heirlooms in Apex Legends?


Heirlooms refer to melee weapons that are uniquely designed for each Legend. Some heirloom weapons are straight out of the lore behind a Legend, such as Wraith’s Kunai, which was given to her by another Wraith from an alternate timeline. Then, there are heirloom weapons that are mainly inspired by the personality of an Apex Legend such as the “Too Much Witt” golden trophy heirloom for Mirage.

With Echoes of Wisdom putting Zelda center stage as the playable protagonist, you might be curious as to where else you can play as Princess Zelda. While this is the first time she’s been playable in a mainline Zelda title (well, barring one strange exception), she’s been playable in plenty of games. Here is every single one of them.

But although capable of wielding a sentinel&#x27;s power, she will still need a specific build if you want to potentialize her already high damage. Here&#x27;s the best Jinhsi build in Wuthering Waves and a few teammates sure to allow her to perform at her best.

                              <span>The Truthseeker&#x27;s Pass takes you on a puzzle-filled adventure in the treacherous Mt. Firmament. Most challenges here are simple to complete, but one may prove difficult towards the end. Here&#x27;s how to turn off the Photonvault and operate the Chronosorter in Wuthering Waves.


Truthseeker&#x27;s Pass Photonvault and Chronosorter puzzle


To solve the Photonvault and Chronosorter puzzle in Truthseeker&#x27;s Pass, you must shoot the Photonvaults in the correct order, starting from right to left. I recommend having a character with long-range attacks, like Chixia, to hit them easily. However, you can get away with melee fighters if you get up close to the glowing objects.

Start with the Photonvault on the far right and then hit the center. Now, target the one on the left, where the game will notify you of its success. If you happen to attack it in the wrong order, don&#x27;t worry; it will reset back to its original formation.


Once that&#x27;s done, approach and activate the Flare Stone. Interact with the moving mechanism to position the Flare Stone on the ground. A boss fight will trigger here, but fortunately, you can take advantage of the new Resonator&#x27;s powers temporarily.


You&#x27;ll eventually unlock the new quest, Road of Pilgrimage, thus progressing in the Jinzhou Rising storyline. Keep continuing forward to earn a bunch of rewards in Wuthering Waves, such as Union EXP, Astrite, Rover&#x27;s Waveband, and upgrade materials. Gifts may differ depending on your current rank for your SOL3 Phase.

Syrcus Tower was of another era, and the 24-man raid turned into a bit of a breeze after A Realm Reborn content aged out of any challenge through levels and gear padding. Back in the day, those Crystal Tower bosses put up more of a fight, with fights like Amon&#x27;s shape-shifting, icy mechanics being among the more difficult. In recent years, he was about as threatening as a wet noodle, and the angry theatre kid came out of him with the 7.0 update. Instead of spawning ice blocks to hide behind…</span>

                              <span>The Greats of the Game Player Highlights objective is a neat little addition in EA FC 24, and Ultimate Team users can complete the tasks to get additional rewards. 


The Festival of Football season has seen plenty of  trivia-based objective sets being released in recent times. At first, we got the Euro Throwbacks, and then came the Copa Throwbacks. Tonight&#x27;s release is pretty similar, but EA Sports has made the hints lot clearer than the last couple of weeks. 


EA FC 24 Greats of the Game Player Highlights objective tasks


There are five different tasks, and all of them are based around incidents that happened in real-life football tournaments. 



The Phenomenon: Score at least 1 goal per match using a Brazilian player in 6 separate wins in any game mode.


On the Volley: Score a volley using a French player in any game mode.


Midfield Masterclass: Score and assist a goal using French players in 6 separate matches in any game mode.


Screamer: Score a goal from Outside the Box using a player from Portugal in any game mode.


Golden Boot: Score 3 goals using Spanish players in any game mode.



All five tasks offer identical rewards: 200 Seasonal XP and one 84+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack. The rewards are not bad, as the objective tasks can be completed while playing matches across different game modes. Some of the tasks will finish quicker, while the remaining ones might take bit more time. Nevertheless, all the five tasks are really easy to complete, and make to them to get the rewards. 


Once the Greats of the Game Player Highlights objective set is complete, you&#x27;ll earn a 87+ x2 Rare Players Pack. Getting two guaranteed promo cards for free is always a great deal, and there&#x27;s a chance for one or both of them to be Greats of the Game Icons/Heroes. The promo features legends from all the nations participating at the ongoing Euro and Copa America championships.

                              <span>The Alan Shearer Greats of the Game Icon card could be a great addition for many EA FC 24 players and their Ultimate Team squads, as the item can be obtained for free. 


The Greats of the Game promo is now live in Ultimate Team, and a special squad of Heroes and Icons have been added in packs. You&#x27;ll have to depend on your luck to find them, but there&#x27;s no such issue with this Shearer card. As long as all the tasks of his objective set is completed in time, the card is yours to keep. 


All EA FC 24 Alan Shearer Greats of the Game Icon Objective tasks


The latest objective set has four different tasks. You can complete them in any order, but certain tasks are quicker to finish than the remaining ones. 



True Attacker: Score 8 goals using English Attackers in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Strikers Touch: Score and Assist at least 1 goal per match using English players in 4 separate Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


From Distance: Score 3 goals from Outside the Box in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).


Winning Formula: Win 12 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from England in your starting 11.



To complete the tasks, you can play matches in Squad Battles, Division Rivals, and Weekend Champions. Squad Battles will be the easiest place to finish the tasks, as managing matches against AI-controlled opponents is pretty easy. 


The 93-rated ST item has some decent in-game stats and 5* Weak Foot. From the looks of it, this version will get upgrades in future based on results from England&#x27;s matches in the Euros. A 4th playstyle+ will make the card lot more useable in competitive modes, and it&#x27;s best suited for beginners at the moment.

The Stalker&#x27;s famous bow, Dread, is probably the most well-known of his loadout and looks extremely awesome on any Warframe. Here&#x27;s how to craft a Warframe build around it.


Obtaining Dread


If you would rather save your platinum, Dread is likely to be an early drop as soon as the Stalker gets on your trail. When you have completed a relevant Assassination mission, you will receive a mysterious message from the Stalker promising to hunt you down.

But while some struggle, others are giving themselves challenges to make the incredibly tough fight harder, including no dodging or blocking.

A big disclaimer before we jump into the tier list though: Genshin Impact tier lists suck. There’s no one universal way to assign value to characters in Genshin. The tiers below don’t necessarily correlate with power level; rather, I tried to sort characters by team flexibility, overall utility, and popularity in the meta.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is all about making new friends, exploring new regions, and enjoying fun activities with others. If you&#x27;re completing Star Path duties, you&#x27;ll find objectives asking you to hang out with or give gifts to certain characters, one of which is known as Casita&#x27;s resident.


Who is Casita&#x27;s resident in Disney Dreamlight Valley?


Casita&#x27;s resident in Disney Dreamlight Valley is more commonly known as Mirabel, the protagonist of Encanto. You&#x27;ll unlock Mirabel as a villager after completing Merlin&#x27;s friendship questline, locating the golden doorknob in Peaceful Meadow, and building Mini-Casita.

The name Casita comes from the original Encanto movie. The Casa Madrigal, the magical home Mirabel&#x27;s family stayed in, is also commonly known as Casita. Mini-Casita stems directly from this, and it acts as the house Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s version of Mirabel lives in.


Once you unlock Mirabel through Merlin&#x27;s friendship quests and the golden doorknob questline, you can find her roaming around Dreamlight Valley or Eternity Isle if you have the Rift in Time expansion. 


Depending on the Star Path task, you can hang out with her, have daily discussions, or give her her favorite gifts for the day. Some tasks are easily completed in one day, while others, like giving more than three gifts or having more than one daily discussion, require several days. Make sure to watch the Star Path&#x27;s duration so you&#x27;ll have enough time to finish your objectives and claim every reward. The token amount you receive also depends on the task, but you&#x27;ll usually get around 10 to 20.

                              <span>Wuthering Waves Version 1.1 introduces a new explorative area, Mt. Firmament. Unlike most locations on the map, you won&#x27;t be able to travel to it by regular means, as it requires a specific quest. So, if you aren&#x27;t sure how to reach Mt. Firmament in Wuthering Waves, we&#x27;re here to show you the way.


How do you reach Mt. Firmament in Wuthering Waves?


To get to Mt. Firmament in Wuthering Waves, progress in the main storyline until you reach the Dreamy Scents quest. Those who have yet to unlock this mission must at least be around Union Level 21. The key part you&#x27;re looking for involves going to City Hall, which begins your journey to the island.


I&#x27;ve tested to see if there&#x27;s another way into Mt. Firmament by flying in, but unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way through. Thus, the only way to get to it is by using the ferry during the To Mt. Firmament quest.

The enemies within this island may pose a greater challenge, as it is tied to your current SOL3 Phase Level. Level up your party to survive longer here, or lower your SOL3 Phase to make it more accessible. However, keep in mind that rewards will be affected once your Phase level has been adjusted. 


When you approach the ferry, a reasonably long cutscene triggers, discussing the next mission in the storyline. Continue to progress through this quest to make your way to the island. At this point, you&#x27;ll need to fix some structures and eliminate foes to access the entire Mt. Firmament map. It&#x27;s not too challenging to complete, so just keep following the waypoints of the To Mt. Firmament saga.


There are a ton of new features to explore in this new Wuthering Waves area, including quests, unique gameplay mechanics, and challenges. Explore it to the fullest to reap more rewards for your party and unlock unique storylines.

One of the changes, implementing Mount Tilt when turning while on a mount, is causing a bit of eye strain and even motion sickness for some players. If you are wondering how to turn off the Mount Tilt in FFXIV Dawntrail, here is what we have found.





No current FFXIV Dawntrail Mount Tilt settings


Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any existing settings in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail associated with Mount Tilt. Because this is a new thing, it&#x27;s very likely Square Enix simply didn&#x27;t calculate that this would be an issue for some players.

If you’re a collector, you’ll be happy to learn that there are 13 different Teddy Bears to discover in Fallout 76, and you’re going to want to know where to find them.

One of these minions, the Bluecoat Cat, is accessible early into the expansion, but you’ll need to complete a few steps before you can take this kitty on your travels. And who doesn’t love an adorable kitty? Especially one of this pedigree. 


How to get the Bluecoat Cat in Final Fantasy XIV

To get the Bluecoat Cat minion in FFXIV Dawntrail, you&#x27;ll need 800 Sacks of Nuts from participating in The Hunt. You don&#x27;t need a Dawntrail-specific currency, so participating in even older Endwalker hunts is good enough to earn more Sacks of Nuts.  


After you unlock Dawntrail Hunts, the Bluecoat Cat minion is available immediately. So, sprint off to that hunt NPC as soon as you can before adventuring too far into Tural. If you want to dive into the Hunt in Dawntrail, you’ll need to have done a few things:



Reach level 90 on any Disciple of War or Magic Job


Complete the level 60 side quest ‘Elite and Dangerous’


Complete the level 90 MSQ quest ‘The Rite of Succession’

The Bluecoat Cat can be purchased from Ryubool Ja (X:13.9, Y:13.4), in the stall to the left of the Hunt Board in Tuliyollal. To get the kitty, you’ll need to part with 800 Sacks of Nuts.


You can get Sacks of Nuts by defeating Hunt Marks in any Shadowbringers, Endwalker, or Dawntrail area, but you won’t be able to access the Ryubool Ja’s wares until you’ve completed the above steps to unlock the Dawn Hunt.

The Summer Sale is the perfect time to pick up a few (or a lot) titles for pretty cheap.

But some deals are especially worth your consideration, so let&#x27;s take a look at ten options you won&#x27;t regret considering in this year&#x27;s summer sale.


Top 10 Steam Summer Sale 2024 deals


Some of the games on this list are recent, while a few have aged by some years. I have considered two significant factors while judging these deals from the rest: both the quality of the game, and the extent of the discount. Additionally, note that the or…</span>

MW3 and Warzone&#x27;s Season 4 Reloaded patches are now in the books, with the new Reclaimer 18 shotgun added to the game, a Sledgehammer melee weapon, and a new multiplayer map too. Even with all that new content though, players are already thinking about the next one, which is Season 5. 


So, if you&#x27;re already counting down the days until your next batch of new weapons, maps, and tweaks, then look no further.

When does MW3 and Warzone Season 5 begin?


MW3 and Warzone Season 5 is expected to kick off on Wednesday, July 24, 2024. This is because seasons generally last eight weeks, and this would be eight weeks exactly since Season 4 began. 


Unfortunately, this hasn&#x27;t been confirmed by the developers just yet, so take this information with a pinch of salt. There have been occasions where the developer has moved seasonal launches, either due to holidays or a need to delay them and work on them further. We&#x27;ll be sure to update this article when we know more. 


What will be included in MW3 and Warzone Season 5?


While we don&#x27;t know the exact details of what will be included, we can make educated guesses about what will come based on previous seasons. 


We would expect there to be some sort of crossover with another media entity, whether it be a movie, game, or TV series, along with at least one new gun, and possibly a melee weapon too. There&#x27;s also likely to be at least one multiplayer map, a new Battle Pass, additional game modes, and changes to Warzone maps.

It was supposed to be launching later this year, but the publisher has since announced it&#x27;s being held back thanks to the surprise announcement of a new Life is Strange game from Deck Nine.


According to GamesIndustry.biz, Don&#x27;t Nod explained this in a press release, confirming a new launch window of early 2025 due to &quot;recent trends and developments in the industry.&quot; Life is Strange: Double Exposure was unveiled during the Xbox showcase earlier this month, with it already slated to release on October 29 and bring back the very first game&#x27;s protagonist Max Caulfield.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming &quot;Souls-lite&quot; fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: &quot;Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience. I count myself in that third camp. Something about the game’s premise stuck with me, but after playing several hours of a beta version, I’ve gone from admiring Infinity Nikki conceptually to being genui…</span>

                              <span>Developer Don&#x27;t Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don&#x27;t Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017&#x27;s Before the Storm and 2021&#x27;s True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We&#x27;ve made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage to early 2025. We know you&#x27;re all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy

Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange&#x27;s endings.

Megami Tensei — also known as Shin Megami Tensei — is one of the longest-running RPG franchises in the world. But most of us wouldn&#x27;t know it. Making its debut in 1987 on the Famicom, it wouldn&#x27;t be until the Virtual Boy that Nintendo gamers (well, a few of them) would find out about the demon-summoning series. And now, the series boasts multiple sub-series, revivals, remakes, and enhanced editions. It&#x27;s a pretty big hole to dive down.
Since gaining popularity in the West — thanks to Shin Megami Tensei III and Persona 3 on the PS2 — Atlus&#x27; star has only risen, with the latter sub-series becoming its own beast. But in terms of the more traditional, hardcore, and games you can get in the West, what is the best Shin Megami Tensei game?

The suspect accused of sending threats to Nintendo and attending audiences during the now-cancelled Nintendo Live event in Tokyo earlier this year has now admitted to the charges (thanks, Splatoon Torikara).
What&#x27;s more, when explaining the motive behind his threats, the 27-year-old individual blamed his actions on... get this... losing at games.

                              <span>Dawn of a new day.
To someone who isn’t an avid fan, the Legend of Heroes series can seem a little difficult to break into. The dozen or so games released over the past two decades are spread across four distinct arcs that all collectively built out one of the most detailed and tightly interconnected universes in all of gaming, one which is still slowly building towards an epic conclusion. Yet, with this new release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, it’s never been a better time to give these games a shot. Trails Through Daybreak is a fresh start for the series in more ways than one, offering an experience that will appeal to fans both new and old.
Trails Through Daybreak is set in the Republic of Calvard, an economically dominant state with a level of technological advancement that rivals the modern real world, and begins by introducing us to Van Arkride, a local ‘Spriggan’. Van’s role is as a sort of private investigator who takes shady jobs that the local law enforcement won’t cover themselves, but business for him seems to be going a little slow as he’s woken up from a nice nap in his office by a schoolgirl named Agnes Claudel.

It&#x27;s crazy to consider DK called anything other than Donkey Kong, but there was a time when Nintendo considered other possibilities including some wild swings.
Back in the &#x27;80s, Nintendo and Universal went head to head in a lawsuit with the former accused of basing DK on the iconic ape of the big screen, King Kong.

Ahead of its next fighter addition, developer Fair Play Labs has released a new update for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2.
This latest update bundles together patch 1.09 and 1.10, making it a rather bulky list of changes. One of the headline additions this time around is a new Squads Mode where you pick a lineup of three fighters and pit them against an opposing team, with new fighters entering the battle only when their predecessor is KO&#x27;d. The update also adds a New Game+ mode, allowing you to repeat the story with all unlocked perks and cosmetics alongside a new difficulty, stage, rules, rewards and more.

                              <span>Warning: spoilers abound.
Even just one year after The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s launch in May 2023, its story, cutscenes, and music have already reached legendary status among fans. Heck, even the pre-launch trailers gave us all kinds of goosebumps. Honestly, though, we never would have expected a Game Boy &#x27;demake&#x27; of the title to illicit such a similar response.
Alas, a selection of cutscenes from the game has been given a stunning Game Boy treatment alongside its iconic music, courtesy of YouTube channel, uh... &#x27;it&#x27;. We get to see the opening sequence of the game in which Zelda and Link stumble across... something... alongside a look at some of its closing moments. So just be wary if you&#x27;ve yet to finish Tears of the Kingdom - this is pretty spoilerific.

                              <span>The Paramount series includes special features.

The Sonic the Hedgehog series &#x27;Knuckles&#x27; made its debut on Paramount Plus earlier this year and it was generally well-received. If you haven&#x27;t already watched it or would just like a physical copy, you&#x27;re in luck. As previously confirmed, a Blu-ray and DVD is on the way and we&#x27;ve now got a bit more information about the release.

The Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition arrives on the Switch next month and to help promote this upcoming release a new overview trailer has been uploaded.
This trailer is only available on Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese YouTube channel right now, but goes in-depth about the challenges across all of the games. It will also come with a special Survival Mode and Legend challenges - such as finishing a game in a single run. In case you missed our initial coverage, here are the titles that will be included in this new package:

Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership kicked off the latest Direct broadcast and although we&#x27;ve already seen a fair bit of footage of this new release, one thing Nintendo hasn&#x27;t properly shown off just yet is the game&#x27;s box art. Yes, it&#x27;s been featured in listings here and there, but now, in the latest update, it&#x27;s been given an official reveal on social media.
As you see it features Nintendo&#x27;s famous duo, a new character called Snoutlet and a little bit of the world Mario and Luigi are about to explore known as Concordia. An empty background on the cover art (similar to Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story + Bowser Jr.&#x27;s Journey) also returns. Nintendo further notes how pre-orders are now live.

                              <span>Mika and The Witch&#x27;s Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it&#x27;s a &quot;mini open world&quot; game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while &quot;omnimanouevring&quot; around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this &quot;evolution of JRPGs&quot;, in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I&#x27;m so confident of this, in fact, that I&#x27;m going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

                              <span>The makers of Cyberpunk 2077 host a podcast every once in a while, in which the studio&#x27;s developers chat about what&#x27;s going on in the company. In the latest episode, they&#x27;re discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it&#x27;s spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There&#x27;s a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer&#x27;s earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG&#x27;s shortcomings. 
&quot;I see that we didn&#x27;t push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance,&quot; said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  &quot;Like, let&#x27;s say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I&#x27;m like, we weren&#x27;t far enough in &#x27;77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time of the year again. You know the one. Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think Elden Ring is a massive open world game that&#x27;s a bit too large and in charge. I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC&#x27;s come out, I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll reach it again despite the fact I think it&#x27;s very good. It&#x27;s interesting then, that FromSoftware&#x27;s president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as &quot;the limit&quot; for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it&#x27;s a great thing, personally.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the open world series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, via one of those odd promotional things disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we&#x27;ve created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

                              <span>Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

                              <span>When the ageing, silent character you play in puzzle adventure Selfloss performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its Steam demo just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

                              <span>I mentioned it briefly in my Shadow Of The Erdtree review, but there&#x27;s one area of the DLC where your steed Torrent is so scared they refuse to be summoned. That&#x27;s because said area is a woodland that&#x27;s been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don&#x27;t dare clop their hooves. What I hadn&#x27;t expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It&#x27;s made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring&#x27;s open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

In a post ominously titled &quot;Tribes 3 Player Update&quot;, Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming &quot;sports shooter&quot; Ultra Strikers. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

                              <span>Popular monster-enslaving sim Palworld has a big new update, which introduces the game&#x27;s long-promised PvP multiplayer Arena together with a new island, new Pals, new Pal skills, a new Raid, new buildings and construction options, new open world activities and items - new everything, basically. The island is Sakurajima, a place of pink blossoms and red Tori gates which is ruled by the Moonflower faction from the security of their tower HQ. As for the Arena, where players can have their Pals duel for supremacy, you&#x27;ll find it in the Dessicated Desert. Catch a glimpse of all the wanton Pokenot abuse in the below trailer.

                              <span>Live service games such as The First Descendant - a Warframe-ish co-op looter shooter coming next month - can often suffer from a chronic case of numbers-itis, a tragic and goopy disease that stagnates game feel, letting raw and tasteless maths multiply and overwhelm what I, in all my critical wisdom, call “fun button pushy.” Developer NEXON Games were kind enough to answer a few of my questions recently, and most of all, I wanted to know how they’d immunised their endgame against this miserable ailment. The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

                              <span>Hades 2&#x27;s third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn&#x27;t change is how sexy the gods are, but because they&#x27;re so sexy anyway, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an issue moving forwards.

Considering the lengthy ongoing development of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and the subsequent grilling from eager fans that Ubisoft has brought upon itself over the years, it’s easy to forget just how darn good the original game is. First released on PS2, Xbox, and GameCube at the end of 2003, Beyond Good &amp; Evil was one of the most unique adventure games of its day, showcasing a world that Nintendo itself would have been proud to call its own.
This 20th Anniversary Edition remaster updates the experience with revamped visuals, improved performance (sort of), quality-of-life upgrades, and more. But is it still as enjoyable now as it was two decades ago? Well, the answer is thankfully a resounding “yes”: Ubisoft’s re-release is easily the best way to experience Jade and Pey’j’s epic journey on Nintendo hardware, but it’s also not without a few niggling issues.

Is there any genre SteamWorld is afraid to tackle? Starting life as an RTS in SteamWorld Tower Defense, Image &amp; Form’s long-running anthology series has been to space, the Wild West and it’s even taken on the form of a fairy tale. And while Dig, the Metroidvania-style series, is arguably the most popular, many have a soft spot for the 2015 3DS hit SteamWorld Heist.
Returning to the strategy-esque roots of the franchise, SteamWorld Heist is a side-on turn-based strategy game that takes the unique aesthetic and humour of the SteamWorld series and combines it with gunslinging, bullet-ricocheting action. We loved it, and Ultimate Edition on Switch is a no-brainer. Even so, we weren’t expecting to see Heist return, but nine years later, SteamWorld Heist II is almost here. We got a chance to go hands-on with the PC version of the game at Summer Game Fest, and we can already tell this is a well-oiled machine that fans will love, and newcomers can jump straight into, too.

Yes, the new Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition on PS5 has taken the gold this time, putting up 24,012 sales on the console in its debut week (and the PS4 version has slipped in at fourth). Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door fall into second and third and there are a couple of newbies at seven and ten as Radiant Silvergun and Spirit Hunter Series Complete Collection make their Japanese debut.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t lose your head.
Aspyr has today announced that 2002&#x27;s Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will be blasting onto Switch on 1st August in an all-new package.
You might remember this third-person action-adventure from back in the GameCube days. In it, you play as Jango Fett (before his little run-in with Mace Windu, obviously) on a mission to capture a mysterious Dark Jedi. Expect all the trappings of classic Mandalorian combat as you blast, scorch and fly your way through the campaign.

If you had visited an arcade in the late &#x27;70s and ’80s, there’s a good chance you’d come across a bustling Sprint cabinet complete with crowd-pulling steering wheels and pedals. Atari’s once ubiquitous overhead racing classic is now making a comeback on modern consoles with NeoSprint, and we’re happy to report that it largely holds up as a well-executed throwback.
It’s the latest in Atari’s effort to partner with indie developers to bring its classic IPs into the 21st century. Headless Chicken, the Costa Rican studio behind this loving retro revival, manages to retain the rubber-burning essence of the original games while incorporating contemporary gameplay modes, vehicle customization, and a surprisingly robust track builder.

If you&#x27;ve never stumbled across one before, KidZania is a strange concept. This is a child-sized indoor city full of ultrarealistic role-playing opportunities for kids to try out different careers, make money (only to be used in the attraction, we might add) and get a taste of adult life.
The available career experiences vary across the 26 KidZania sites worldwide, though they always tend to offer a broad spectrum covering everything from a doctor to a TV presenter. What we didn&#x27;t realise, however, is that two of Japan&#x27;s KidZania sites (Tokyo and Koshien) have teamed up with Nintendo to offer a &#x27;Game Developer&#x27; experience for its young attendees.

Nintendo&#x27;s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders has been and gone. Among questions about the company&#x27;s plans for the future, its partnerships and wider technical concerns, one attendee asked about Nintendo&#x27;s approach to leaked information and the preventative measures it is taking for the future.
According to Nintendo&#x27;s response, the company has been working with specialists to diagnose any potential security concerns and has introduced a new system of internal &quot;information security management&quot; to prevent future leaks. This comes alongside repeated employee training on correct information-handling practices.

Rather unexpectedly, however, one question raised concerns regarding Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s age and role at Nintendo, with the attendee noting their wish that creators &quot;take care of their bodies&quot;.

It&#x27;s fair to say that the late Queen Elizabeth II had her fair share of bling during her 70-year reign; you know, the Imperial State Crown, the Sovereign&#x27;s Orb, the Kokoshnik Tiara... rather expensive stuff, a few notches above the kind of tat you might have found at the bottom of a box of Coco Pops.
Given her status, however, we imagine many folks also attempted to send her a number of luxurious gifts. One such example came courtesy of publisher THQ to celebrate the Wii release of the long-forgotten Big Family Games (Neighborhood Games). Rather than send just the game itself, THQ commissioned a 24K gold-plated Wii console to be carted off to Buckingham Palace. If nothing else, Lilibet could have sold it on for a few extra quid, but unfortunately, the console never made it to her.

                              <span>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it&#x27;s 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that&#x27;d be more at home in a horror game. 
But I&#x27;m also looking forward to the community&#x27;s reaction to the Dragon Age series&#x27; best character creator yet. At the heart …</span>

                              <span>We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation&#x27;s upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we&#x27;re excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game&#x27;s progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we&#x27;ve played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation&#x27;s HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game&#x27;s 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn&#x27;t seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…</span>

                              <span>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.</span>

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002&#x27;s Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game&#x27;s most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, &quot;Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.&quot; However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game&#x27;s campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

                              <span>A gamer who impersonated an anti-piracy partner working for Bungie as part of a bogus DMCA takedown notice campaign on YouTube, agreed to a $8.1m copyright infringement judgment. Nicholas Minor, aka Lord Nazo, sent 96 fraudulent takedown notices against creators in the Destiny 2 community early 2022. An injunction targeting the defendant aims to ensure there&#x27;s no repeat of any similar behavior, anywhere in the world, ever again.

                              <span>Atari 50 was already a fairly comprehensive offering of retro games spanning half a century, launching in late 2022 as a playable museum of sorts charting the classic publisher’s output across arcade machines, the 2600, 5200, 7800 and Jaguar home consoles, 8-bit computers and the Lynx handheld. The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.

As the summery story expansion prepares to drop, Square Enix have run down everything else arriving in the MMO’s 7.0 patch, which notably includes its long-awaited graphical overhaul along with several other nice-to-have improvements whether you’re playing Dawntrail or not.

                              <span>Dead Rising is a proper gem, taking an overdone trope - zombies in a shopping centre - and turning it into a brilliantly quirky and challenging survival game that fully delivers on the madcap joy of using anything you can find to mow down hordes of the undead and then snap photos of them. Truly a proto-Instagram-era Nostradamus. Almost ten years after the first game came to PC, and upsettingly close to 20 years from its debut, the original Dead Rising is coming back in a fresh remaster.

                              <span>The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king&#x27;s violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir &quot;ManliestDev&quot; Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell&#x27;s chief stone-shover.

If you liked Townscaper for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of Tiny Glade&#x27;s homely castle creation, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. Dystopika is a cyberpunk build &#x27;n&#x27; chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There&#x27;s no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.

                              <span>I don’t dislike The First Descendant. It has a good grasp of the numbers-go-up-yay appeal behind looter shooters. Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.
Happily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.

Upcoming expansions will focus heavily on the Immortal Empires megamap campaign, and there were lord and unit reveals for the Ogres, Greenskins, and Khorne factions that headline the next DLC - slated for the &quot;back end of the year&quot;. Certain party poopers among you will be pleased to know that I cannot accurately refer to the 17 minute video below as a “tray-tray”.

                              <span>The internet doesn&#x27;t exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There&#x27;s networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There&#x27;s no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military.

                              <span>Fallen Aces is a stylish FPS lead pipe ‘em up with immersive sim elements, published by good gun-knowers New Blood Interactive. Your gumshoe ‘tagonist wakes up, hungover of brain, skint of wallet, and unshaven of face, to discover your apartment - undoubtedly reeking of smokerettes and dehydration wee - is being broken into by foes goonly and mookish. They take a while to boot the door down, which gives you a moment to observe the place and consider which of Fallen Aces&#x27; expansive makeshift weapon selection you&#x27;d like to batter them with. Decisions, decisions...

After eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent. In the pan.

                              <span>Game development studio and intergalactic war ministry Arrowhead have launched a new series of written update posts for players of Helldivers 2 to help keep the war record straight. Mostly, this is the usual case of somebody on the team gathering quotes as the developers batter their fingertips against keyboards to bring you, the video gamer, fresh cannons and what-have-you. But there is some insight into what the conflict-pushers at Arrowhead have enjoyed most about player actions over the last month, including bringing an entire planet to the liberated state of post-existence.

                              <span>When I finished my review for Soulslike Lies Of P, the devs released a patch not long after that nerfed bosses and made things for ol&#x27; Pinnochio easier overall. Sod&#x27;s Law struck that day… and it&#x27;s returned with a smirk. Shadow Of The Erdtree has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.

                              <span>With a groan, it rises. The first Resident Evil is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a digital download, so you don&#x27;t have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It&#x27;s going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.

We know that if the milk looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. Do not taste the forbidden yogurt, as much as it calls to you. How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting Shadow Of The Erdtree build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the Elden Ring DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.

If you haven&#x27;t played it, you should buy it quick - because it&#x27;s being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.

Now the other players could be Lara Croft, who has been added to the game&#x27;s public test server in advance of a full release next month.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there&#x27;s no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It&#x27;s unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we&#x27;re stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…</span>

                              <span>Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that&#x27;s Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country&#x27;s Steam listing simply says the release date is &quot;to be announced.&quot; 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan&#x27;s voice actor, Roger Clark. 
&quot;Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam listing reads. &quot;Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you&#x27;d expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.&quot;
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer&#x27;s Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe&#x27;s next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

                              <span>The one and only Elden Ring expansion we&#x27;re getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn&#x27;t – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads &quot;1.12.2&quot; if it has – select &quot;LOGIN&quot; and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you&#x27;ve previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you&#x27;re encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game&#x27;s system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software&#x27;s Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook&#x27;s body, including things like a Qunari&#x27;s horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…</span>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

                              <span>Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There&#x27;s no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot;


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.</span>

                              <span>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game&#x27;s original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney&#x27;s original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey&#x27;s actions shape his destiny and the game&#x27;s story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.</span>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi&#x27;s sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…</span>

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion&#x27;s difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can&#x27;t press the buttons in the right order.
As publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don&#x27;t want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.

The RPG in question is Broke Signal Badlands: A World of Desert Adventure, and yes, that&#x27;s a very upbeat subtitle for a game in which you can perish after getting your hand stuck in the door of an abandoned Fonts Museum, or while yanking cacti out of your foot. There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I&#x27;ve only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

                              <span>Cyan Worlds&#x27; remake of their 1997-released Myst sequel Riven launches today on Steam. Word on the reviewvine is that it&#x27;s jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker&#x27;s shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still a demo on Steam at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.

                              <span>The co-operative clambering of Chained Together is easy to understand. It&#x27;s like Fall Guys in the fiery pits of hell, with a tower of fiendish platforming challenges. It brings to mind the mind-shattering failures of Getting Over It and a previous short-lived clamber sim called Only Up. Also, you are chained to your teammates. Every time you fall in this fiery multiplayer de-motivator, you are taking your pals with you, usually right back to the start. At RPS, we are not fazed, this should be straightforward. Nic, Edwin, and Brendan are all disciplined people. Yes, they are bound together in unbreakable irons. Yes, Nic does sometimes leap into the abyss without warning. Yes, they remain divided on precisely what obscene act the giant demon in the game&#x27;s background is performing with his idle hands. But none of this means they can&#x27;t work together to escape the inferno. Right?

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.

                              <span>The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don&#x27;t worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That&#x27;s a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat &#x27;em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don&#x27;t know any other objects associated with this mythological &quot;summer&quot; people talk about, I&#x27;m from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that&#x27;ll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.

                              <span>Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.

                              <span>News reports from South Korea, reveal that Internet provider KT actively installed malware on the computers of over half a million subscribers. The malware was intended to interfere with BitTorrent traffic, presumably as a network management solution. A police investigation suggests that cost savings likely played a role too, which is not surprising given local file-sharing habits.

                              <span>Major recording labels, including UMG and Sony have filed a pair of broadly similar copyright complaints against two key generative AI music services. The RIAA-managed lawsuits accuse the owners of Udio and Suno of copying the labels&#x27; music on a massive scale and the labels suggest that they&#x27;re already on the back foot. In pre-litigation correspondence, both were &#x27;evasive&#x27; on content sources before citing fair use, which the RIAA notes only arises as a defense in cases of unauthorized use of copyright works.

Over the years in dozens of Phoronix articles there have been countless metrics showing off the out-of-the-box performance benefits from leveraging software built for higher x86_64 micro-architecture feature levels, employing compiler-based function multi-versioning, and the other extensive performance tuning carried out by Intel software engineers. But now with the Intel Xeon 6700E &quot;Sierra Forest&quot; series now being available for these all-E-core server processors, I was curious about quantifying the Clear Linux benefits over the likes of Ubuntu Linux. Here are those benchmarks for those curious about the difference.</span>

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is.

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

                              <span>Roguelikes! They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia.

                              <span>The end of EA’s decades-long FIFA deal in 2022 means there’s currently a FIFA-shaped hole in the world of video games that isn’t quite filled by EA’s not-FIFA replacement EA Sports FC 24 and is yet to measure up the efforts of whoever the footballing organisation gets to make the next officially licensed FIFA game. So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game Rocket League.

                              <span>Open-world zombie adventure Days Gone might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via Xitter, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to &quot;never say never&quot; about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had already been completed prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.
Even with the caveat of &quot;I’m not holding my breath&quot;, Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May tweeXed a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. &quot;A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen&quot;, Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being &quot;fans&quot; of the game.

                              <span>I have recently moved to an area that’s surrounded by forest, or at least, by swathes of greenery that feel like forests when you’re far enough inside them, even if they don’t meet whatever quantifiable definition is currently in vogue. My dreams are ablaze with scenes of sunlight percolating through shifting layers of beech and oak, with visions of dirt paths winding through bramble. Now, here comes Engraving to transform all those dreams into nightmares.

                              <span>Among Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree&#x27;s more fearsome bosses is the Dancing Lion, a festive prancing terror inspired by Chinese Lion dances. Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it&#x27;s just two guys in a lion suit. They aren&#x27;t even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

                              <span>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, Shadow Of The Erdtree is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.

As you&#x27;d expect, Elden Ring&#x27;s recently released Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC remains this week&#x27;s Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.

Pro zranitelnost ale ani nemusí být TPM přítomen. Chyba byla objevena v Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 7th Gen a X1 Yoga 4th Gen. Nicméně Phoenix později oznámil, že se chyba týká patrně všech jejich UEFI firmware s procesory Intel AlderLake, CoffeeLake, CometLake, IceLake, JasperLake, KabyLake, MeteorLake, RaptorLake, RocketLake a TigerLake. Zranitelné tedy jsou tedy stovky modelů od Lenovo, Dell, Acer a HP.</span>

I do not have a completely true fact to share about books with you this week, because I just read a book telling me that sharing facts about books is actually destroying the online book facts industry. Check back next week, by which time I may have finished another book debunking these claims. This week, it’s the developer behind Sluggish Morss, Dujanah, and the upcoming Judero, Jack King-Spooner! Cheers Jack! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

                              <span>E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It&#x27;s Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend. Enjoy!

                              <span>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it&#x27;s always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


&quot;Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we&#x27;ll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5&#x27;s hardware.&quot; 
Though Mojang hasn&#x27;t revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to &quot;Settings&quot; on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select &quot;Preview.&quot; This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he&#x27;s playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix&#x27;s animated Minecraft series.

That something, of course, is 19th-century literature, as developers FuturLab let us wash our way through their take on the surreal world of Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland.

The colourful title had been due to release this coming Monday, but developers Radical Forge have now pushed back its launch date indefinitely in order to prioritise “the health and well-being of our team”.

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed a remastered Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th anniversary edition  this week, out on 25th June, but that&#x27;s not the Beyond Good &amp; Evil many are hungering for. Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 was announced back in 2008, around 16 years ago. I remember writing about that trailer of Pey&#x27;j the porcine mechanic eating a fly for a blog somewhere. &quot;Fly-eating mechanics confirmed?&quot; I probably scribbled, in the blessed innocence of youth.

                              <span>When the makers of Cloudpunk revealed their next game would be set in the same cyberpunk city as their sci-fi delivery sim, my ears were pricked. When they showed you&#x27;d be running a noodle bar and fishing in the slums instead of flying a hovercar around, I went into full wishlisty mode. Nivalis (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you&#x27;re intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what&#x27;s coming.

I entertain suspicions of cozy or cosy games, inasmuch as they are increasingly framed as a kind of antidepressant in the face of a darkening world, but that&#x27;s OK, because the remaining 17 words in the sentence are: &quot;Operate your planetary defense cannon to fend off an interplanetary invasion from the comfort of your [cozy] bunker.&quot;

The news comes as part of the controversial (more on this in a bit) company’s digital LRG3 event. You can watch the full thing here, and the Fear Effect trailer below.

                              <span>Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an &quot;Innapropriate activity detected&quot; message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven&#x27;t had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there&#x27;s a proper patch in the works.
Elden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.

Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber, generated millions of dollars in revenue through Jetflicks, a subscription service that reportedly offered more content than Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime. Four of the men face up to five years in prison; Dallmann&#x27;s maximum is 48 years.

A lower court previously held that the defendant had infringed the rights of major movie and TV companies, but due to limited evidence, only for a week. The court of appeal disagreed after his own use of the service was uncovered during a police raid.

                              <span>Dragon Age 4 was revealed years ago under the name Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Ahead of that announcement, Game Informer visited BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story. It&#x27;s here we learned that the name had changed.
I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, &quot;Why the name change?&quot; Here&#x27;s what each told me:

Avowed was featured as a major part of Xbox&#x27;s Summer presentations. The game appeared in the Xbox Game Showcase, and following the new footage, game director Carrie Patel appeared on the official Xbox podcast to share more gameplay and share more about the game. We caught up with Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo to find out even more about Avowed, covering what they think of comparisons to Skyrim, how they feel about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, why romance was considered for the game but ultimately not included, and why playing The Outer Worlds may gave you the best idea of what to expect from Avowed.

Last year, an Xbox store listing for Beyond Good &amp; Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition accidentally went live, with Ubisoft later stating it went up early due to a &quot;technical error.&quot; …</span>

                              <span>YouTuber Videogamedunkey, otherwise known as Dunkey, announced in 2022 that he started a game publishing company called Bigmode, and its first game, Animal Well, launched to critical acclaim last month. In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. 
At the end of Dunkey&#x27;s E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it&#x27;s coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. 
Check out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: 


&quot;Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece,&quot; Bigmode&#x27;s website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. &quot;Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive.&quot; 
Star of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and &quot;fish,&quot; whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. 
Here are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: 

Star of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s massive expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, goes live tomorrow, on June 21, and ahead of its launch, developer From Software has released a patch that adds new hairstyles, inventory options, balance adjustments, and more. It also allows you to summon your Spectral Steed during the game&#x27;s final fight (which, if you&#x27;ve beaten that boss, you know how helpful your mount would have been during it). 
The patch – V1.12 – is now live on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam) and also features hundreds of other changes, like adjustments to weapons, skills, armaments, and general balance-related things. 
The highlight of the patch is all of the new features it adds to Elden Ring, and you can check those out below:

                              <span>Earlier this week, Paradox Interactive announced it was canceling Life By You, a simulation game meant to rival Sims in development at Paradox Tectonic. With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.
That Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. 
&quot;This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who&#x27;ve worked hard on Life By You&#x27;s Early Access release,&quot; Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. &quot;Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…</span>

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. 
&quot;Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise.

                              <span>Virtually anyone with an Internet connection can access pirated movies and TV shows in a few keystrokes. In some cases, an Internet connection isn&#x27;t even required. In Ghana, TV stations are reportedly showing pirated films to their viewers. This is so rampant that the Government&#x27;s film authority has issued a warning.

What exactly are the key architectural qualities of dwellings you might wish to go to bed with? Actually, don’t bother stretching your grey matter – you can just play Building Relationships, which is sort of A Short Hike but also, Love Island for anthropomorphic toy houses. There are demos on Itch and Steam. Be warned that you will be asked whether you’re a rooftop or a bottom floor.

                              <span>A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It&#x27;s also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.
The current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by &quot;Project Phoenix&quot;, first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a &quot;visual prototype&quot; for a brand new Red Faction game.

Ultrawide gaming monitors have clearly avoided non-starter status, given they’ve been around for years, seemingly being exchanged for currency – and yet they’re nowhere near what you might consider the &#x27;default&#x27; option when making a display upgrade. Regular widescreen monitors, with regular 16:9 aspect ratios, remain the go-to. So why switch?

                              <span>Chaos and comedy. Death and rebirth. Luck and, uh, running out of luck. A good roguelike doesn&#x27;t treat the player like other games do. Roguelikes won&#x27;t guide you helpfully along a path, or let you cinematically snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They&#x27;re more likely to dangle you deep between the jaws of defeat and fumble the rope until you go sliding down defeat&#x27;s hungry gullet. This is their beauty, and it&#x27;s a part of why we keep coming back for another go. Next time everything will go right. Next time you&#x27;ll find the right pair of poison-proof loafers, the perfect co-pilot for your spaceship, a stash of stronger, better ropes. Next time.
Here&#x27;s our list of the 19 best roguelikes on PC you can play in 2024.

                              <span>We’re less than a day now from Shadow Of The Erdtree’s launch, and as promised, FromSoft have just released the latest patch (notes here) for the open world game. It’s only 6GB, and you’ll need it to play the expansion, so do click that button if you haven’t already. The updates headline features - new hairstyles, plus inventory and summoning QOL tweaks - were announced last week. However, it seems they buried the lede deeper than my disgust at the game’s Albinuaric murdering community: Torrent, the game’s spectral steed mount, is finally summonable in the fight against the final boss - just as the community have long speculated it was always intended to be.
Spoilers for the name of that boss below, if you’d rather not know.

                              <span>“The Republic Of Pirates was meant to be different…” laments the narration in the opening of the seafaring resource-chain-em-up strategy, out today with a demo on Steam at time of writing. This made me laugh, in the same way someone saying “the failure of Bastard City was deeply sobering” might. Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British. I will avoid easy gags about Plundering Loisences and instead lightly recommend the demo to you. It’s got enough meat on its bones for a less brainwidth-hogging gulp of city building, assuming you like the pirate theme enough. Spy the trailer I’ve shoved in a dangling cage below, as a warning to others who might trespass around this RPS-pelago.

Frictional Games, the creators of first-person horror game Soma, launched the soft toy depiction of the game&#x27;s protagonist Simon on Makeship, aka Kickstarter for plushies. Normally, we don&#x27;t report on merch - why would we? - but there is something deeply and darkly funny about making a fleece-coated fuzzy huggy wuggy about the psychologically harrowing experience of being forgotten under the sea. Then again, Frictional Games are not the first to do this sort of thing.

                              <span>Way back in 2004, that terrible year when I swore off video games entirely to focus on my university studies, developers 1C SeaWolf announced Captain Blood, a piratical action game loosely based on Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s adventure novels, in which a crew of 17th century freebooters set forth across the Spanish Main to rescue a magistrate&#x27;s daughter from assorted bilge-drinking scallywags. Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.
Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. &quot;It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I&#x27;m not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,&quot; he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood&#x27;s ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It&#x27;ll finally launch on PC later this year.

You can find this &quot;first and last&quot; Elden Ring DLC expansion on Steam, the Xbox Store and in the suppurating depths of your very worst nightmares. Am I overdoing it yet? No matter.

                              <span>You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It&#x27;s a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it&#x27;s not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures.

                              <span>UK police are reporting yet another pirate IPTV-related arrest. A warrant was executed at a flat in Nottingham where a 42-year-old was detained on suspicion of offenses related to the provision of pirated Sky broadcasts. For deterrent purposes, both the police and Sky want reports like this to reach the public, and that is being achieved. The response, however, is one of almost universal criticism, on grounds that in many cases have little or nothing to do with piracy.

                              <span>The release of Sonic Generations in 2011 gave players a series-wide greatest hits remake package to celebrate 20 years of Sonic the Hedgehog. Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it&#x27;s not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. 
But Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic&#x27;s abilities, but we&#x27;ve seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…</span>

                              <span>Metal Slug Attack actually began as a mobile tower defense game for iOS and Android devices many years ago, but today, as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Summer Direct presentation, it was revealed the game is getting &quot;reloaded&quot; for just about every platform. Also, of note, this game is not to be confused with the other tactical Metal Slug game, Metal Slug Tactics. You can learn more about that game here.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at some early gameplay from the game and learn why it is scratching their Plants vs. Zombies itch.

Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in multiple seasons of a television show, in Fortnite, and now in Call of Duty.

                              <span>If you were playing Final Fantasy XIV in December 2021, you will remember the launch of its last expansion Endwalker - though not for all the right reasons. The otherwise fantastic cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a barrage of technical problems at launch, as the MMO’s servers buckled under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.

I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.

                              <span>What to compare Nine Sols’ flowing Sekiro-like 2D combat and layered metroidvania exploration to? The eternally sequel-less Hollow Knight? The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.

                              <span>Former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah left BioWare in 2020, commenting that &quot;I know that Dragon Age won&#x27;t just survive without me, it will thrive&quot;. We&#x27;ll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He reckons it&#x27;s thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age&#x27;s combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.

Later the same day, game designer Willem Delventhal shared more a detailed account of his experience working on the game through to its cancellation, via LinkedIn.

There are shadows, technically, but they’re so mellow and fuzzy they might as well be stray pools of sunlight that have forgotten to glow. In this latest chunk of Lord Of The Rings memorabilia from developers Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division, you are a custom-created hobbit who has just taken up residence in the charming Tellytubby town of Bywater, there to spend your days foraging, fishing, feasting and fraternizing with your fellow halfings, all of whom wear expressions of rosy-cheeked humour so intense in their winsome affability that your own face soon forms a merry rictus in response - like that terrible smile from Disco Elysium, but cosy. Oh god, no. Oh god, get it off me.

                              <span>Like many I’m sure, I have extremely fond memories of the original Fallout games, 2 especially. I bought my first laptop for uni, barely suitable for much except typing long literature essays in which I’d complete assignments using my favorite university trick of writing “ah, but to answer this question, we must first explore (whatever I actually wanted to write an essay about.)” Faltering, bricky turnip that it was, I still had some of my favourite gaming memories on that thing, mainly around aging RPGs: Baldur’s Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, and the old Fallouts.

                              <span>When I wrote our Still Wakes The Deep review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. &quot;Gobshite&quot; became &quot;bastard&quot;. The &quot;polis&quot; were localised as the &quot;police&quot;. And every &quot;yersel&quot; sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became &quot;yourself&quot;. Well, turns out that&#x27;s the result of the game defaulting to &quot;International English&quot; for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There&#x27;s another option, says one of the game&#x27;s developers.

And it&#x27;s by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there&#x27;s one thing that really gets me going, it&#x27;s a game devoid of happiness and cheer.

                              <span>There is very little in this world that would get between me and playing an RPG made by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, double for one with a soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Unless, of course, that game was exclusive to Apple Arcade, which Fantasian has been since its 2021 release. I will not speak poorly of Apple, for I already have several other cults out for my blood. Instead, I’ll simply celebrate the fact that, as per Tuesday’s Nintendo DIrect, the game that Sakaguchi developed “thinking it could be [his] final game before retiring” is coming to PC later this year, in ‘Neo Dimension’ form. Have a trailer.

                              <span>Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993&#x27;s Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It&#x27;s a high fantasy RPG in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don&#x27;t talk about their sacrifices enough. It&#x27;s out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020&#x27;s Trials of Mana remake, which was well-received. I&#x27;ve got a trailer&#x27;s worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.

Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re at all familiar with the Dragon Age series, you likely already know BioWare has experimented quite a lot with its gameplay. From Dragon Age: Origins&#x27; real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II&#x27;s mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition&#x27;s strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn&#x27;t quite defined the franchise&#x27;s combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. 
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series&#x27; origins, I feel it&#x27;s found a great (battle)ground …</span>

                              <span>Bloodborne arrived on PS4 in 2015 and immediately became one of the best games of the year, earning a 9.75 out of 10 from Game Informer and even taking home our award for Best PlayStation Exclusive. But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software&#x27;s most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon&#x27;s Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game&#x27;s many fans.

                              <span>Hot off the Boston Celtics&#x27; NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.
Nintendo Switch Sports&#x27; basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.</span>

                              <span>We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.
Metroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.
As a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you&#x27;ll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it&#x27;s also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.


The Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it&#x27;s up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players&#x27; first chance to see its story.
Like other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new &quot;hand-drawn character visuals&quot; for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.
While the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.</span>

                              <span>In The Hundred Line you are Takumi Sumino, a student who is suddenly enrolled at the The Last Defense Academy when an outbreak of monsters threatens his life and the lives of his fellow students. Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.


The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025.</span>

                              <span>In addition to the critically acclaimed Street Fighter 6, which arrived last year, Capcom has been mining its fighting game history with various collections. While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today&#x27;s announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994&#x27;s X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up The Punisher. 
Every fighting game in the collection features online play, including ranked, casual, and lobby matches with rollback netcode plus global high-score leaderboards, plus a training mode and spectator mode. The collection also includes a music jukebox, in-game museum, display filters, and more. 
Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrives physically and digitally on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.
The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.
Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.
The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.
Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</span>

                              <span>For years, fans of the Legend of Zelda have clamored for the titular princess to star in her own game, but even as she&#x27;s become a more prominent character in recent entries, the Zelda-led Zelda game has yet to appear on store shelves. In today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it&#x27;s up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.


While the game takes its art style from 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there&#x27;s no clear indication that it is connected to Link&#x27;s Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create &quot;echoes&quot; of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeo…</span>

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
