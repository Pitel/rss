Considering how much the Fallout franchise has evolved over the years, the original game is still a darn good time and well worth checking out. You can play it on Steam now for a tenner, if you like, but one fan has gone a step further and ported the game over to the 3DS.
As spotted by TheGamer, the mod was created by MrHuu with details posted on GBATemp. You&#x27;ll need to own a legal copy of the original game to migrate the relevant files over to the 3DS (which, of course, needs to be modded), but overall, it sounds like a relatively painless way to play the game on something that isn&#x27;t the Steam Deck.

How to counter Vecna


The best way to counter Vecna is to utilize the Magic Items that spawn in chests specifically when Vecna is the chosen killer. The chests regenerate as the round goes on, allowing you to replenish up to two Magic Items that are great counters to Vecna. You can see the chests glowing with a white aura when they have a Magic Item in them.


Each of the Magic Items allow you to see an aura specific to one of the four spells that Vecna is abl…</span>

All Tactical Hologram Bosses Ranked in Wuthering Waves


Right before I jump into the ranking process, understand that the difficulty of boss encounters in Wuthering Waves depends on several factors, with one of the largest being personal skill. As such, this ranking is based entirely on my own skill level, which may be lesser or greater than yours. For a little context, I am currently on Difficulty 6 on every one of the Tactical Hologram bosses so far, so the rankings will be based on Level 5. I believe this still pretty much paints the same picture, however. Disclaimer over. The…</span>

                              <span>We’ll never know exactly what sort of fiction Tom Clancy would have written if he was less interested in the calibre of specific bullets and their effiency at dismantling burgeoning socialist governments, and more so in the specific sigils required to blast a riot cop through a third story window. While charity shops across the land mourn this devasting loss to their paperback shelves to this very day, we do at least have a glimpse into what such a literary venture may have looked like. Oh, did you like that door? Was it your favourite door? Soz, pal. Strategy game Tactical Breach Wizards just hexed right through it with a new demo as part of Steam Next Fest.

However, XDefiant developer ACHES pointed out the Vector as his favorite and provided a set of attachments that will help you elevate your game to another level. 


During XDefiant&#x27;s three-year development period, few people have had more time playing the free-to-play title than ACHES, who joined Ubisoft as a game developer to help finish the project. The former Call of Duty world champion is no stranger to dominating FPS titles, and he has an inside scoop on which weapons perform best. Consensus highlights the MP7 as the best SMG in XDefiant, but statistics tell a different story.

                              <span>Leslye Headland, the showrunner and screenwriter of Star Wars: The Acolyte, has revealed that a never-before-seen lightsaber model will debut in the series. This brings the number of unique lightsabers appearing in The Acolyte up to three, and I shouldn&#x27;t need to explain why that&#x27;s exciting.


In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Headland said that The Acoylte will introduce Star Wars fans to a new variety of lightsaber that has allegedly never appeared in any other form of Star Wars media. For those who might not know, The Acoylte is set during the waning days of the High Republic, around fifty to one hundred years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace.

                              <span>Rumors alleged that XDefiant movement mechanics could be hindered in Season 1, but Ubisoft&#x27;s Mark Rubin quickly stepped in and put those claims to bed. 


Landon Apollo claimed that mid-air directional movement and strafing would be removed from XDefiant Season 1, along with a nerf to bunny hopping. Rubin responded, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not true. And I know a guy on the inside.&quot; 




That isn&#x27;t to say there won&#x27;t aren&#x27;t any movement changes coming down the pipeline. XDefiant developer ACHES confirmed that the team intends to punish players for repeated jumps and crouches by adding aiming sway. Ubisoft doesn&#x27;t want to restrict players from using any of the free-to-play shooters&#x27; mechanics, but ACHES argued that there is a sweet spot between intended use and spam. As for when this update will go live, On May 25, the XDefiant developer reassured fans that the update would be added in soon. 


If players had a chance to play the XDefiant close beta in 2023, they would have had an opportunity to see the aim sway penalty in action. If a player jumped consecutively too many times in a row, their weapon would shake back and forth, making it hard to quickly line up a shot on an enemy. So even though there won&#x27;t be any substantial movement changes coming, players will have to readjust their plans once this patch goes out. Currently, most players like to use their momentum from a slide into a jump to catch an enemy off guard. Once jumping gets nerfed, players will have to be more cautious about the movement feature and pick their spots with more intent. 


Movement speed is always a contentious topic in FPS titles, and there will inevitably be a frustrated segment of the player base, regardless of how much of a difference this impending change makes. But if you are sick of getting killed by enemies jumping around you, there is at least a little bit of relief coming, even if it isn&#x27;t wide-sweeping.

                              <span>We finally have a preview of the newest character coming to Genshin Impact: Emilie, a perfumist from Fontaine. Here’s everything we know about Emilie so far, from her element to her backstory.


Emilie’s element and details


Emilie is a Dendro character from Fontaine. Her Vision shape tells us that she has a Pneuma alignment. We can’t see her weapon or rarity from her character art, so we’ll have to wait for her kit details before we find out.


Emilie’s Constellation is called Pomum de Ambra, which is Latin for “apple of amber.” This is another name for pomanders – accessories used during the Middle Ages and Renaissance for carrying perfumes.


As a perfumist, Emilie creates a dazzling variety of perfumes for Fontanians to wear. According to Neuvillette, these scents aren’t purely for aesthetics. Some of them have aroma-therapeutic properties and can help regulate mood.


Oddly enough, Emilie’s drip marketing preview also includes mention of a “forensic cleaner.” It’s unclear if Emilie is actually a forensic cleaner as well as a perfumist. It may simply be a reference to how Emilie helps eradicate bad smells by covering them up with pleasant ones.


While we haven’t met Emilie before in Genshin Impact, she’s been mentioned in the past. Lyney, Lynette, and Wriothesley have voice lines about Emilie, and Chevreuse has mentioned being friends with Emilie during previous in-game events.

When is Emilie coming to Genshin Impact?


Given the timing of her announcement, we can expect Emilie to make her debut during Genshin Impact Version 4.8. If Genshin’s current update schedule holds, Version 4.8 should drop on July 17, with more character information being revealed in the weeks leading up to that date.


While we patiently wait for Emilie, Version 4.7 has plenty of new characters and events to keep us occupied, including a brand new game mode.

                              <span>Fortuna is one of the free-roam NPC hubs in Warframe where you are introduced to the Solaris United, Vox Solaris, and Ventkids Syndicates. It’s also where you will have access to the huge Orb Vallis open world. 


Bosses, bounties, races, and so many other explorable areas of this map are yet to be encountered. But in this case, if you are trying to get there, here’s how.


Where is Fortuna in Warframe?


Fortuna is located on the planet Venus. You’ll first have to progress through the planet going south until you get to the Venus Junction. 


To access the Venus Junction, you must do the following:



Complete the Vor’s Prize quest


Complete Saya’s Vigil


Use the Fusion system to rank up any mod

Do this by using the Endo collected into your mission. Go to your mod console across from the foundry and select any mod. Select Fusion and start upgrading.

Once these conditions have been met, defeat the Volt Specter who awaits you in a battle. Upon defeating him, you will now be able to access Venus.


Just complete the E. Gate and Unda missions to get to Fortuna. Upon unlocking the node, you can access the hub with most of the NPCs available to talk to. As you progress more into the quest line, increase your standing with the people there, and unlock the tougher content, everything will eventually become available.


If you are still early on into your questing and progressing through the Star Chart in Warframe, you may not be able to beat the higher bounty levels as they are multi-staged and present you with harder enemies. In that case, you can revisit this area once you have a build that can help out.

Best weapons for Verina in Wuthering Waves


The 4-Star Variation is the best weapon to use for Verina in Wuthering Waves. It perfectly complements her robust healing abilities and offers a decent amount of Energy Regeneration. The Ceaseless Aria also restores Concerto Energy once a Resonance Skill has been released.


Cosmic Ripples is an excellent alternative if you&#x27;re looking for a 5-Star weapon. This Recitifier can help with Verina&#x27;s Energy Regeneration, but it is slig…</span>

                              <span>Developer Puppet Combo is well known for its particular brand of retro horror games, harkening back to the era of PS1 and PS2. The studio combines dated visuals with interesting game mechanics and concepts, juggling classic and modern design ideas that stand the test of time. Its latest game, The Glass Staircase, is particularly good, as it layers its horror with clever tricks for overthinking and scares when you least expect them. 


While many Puppet Combo games are restricted to the developer&#x27;s Patreon, The Glass Staircase is available on all major platforms and is the perfect little hit for any retro horror fans. It took me around two hours to finish, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. My frustrations boiled down to my own silly miscalculations and mistaking some intentional elem…</span>

Despite early reports that Vecna was a rather weak killer compared to others, players have discovered some specific builds that can really take advantage of the four spells Vecna has it his disposal. Here is the best Vecna, The Lich build in Dead by Daylight as of patch 8.0.

Best Vecna, The Lich builds


In the early part of the Public Test Server for Vecna, The Lich, players felt as though the new D&amp;D killer was a bit on the weaker side. However, after players got more time to learn him and discover his strengths and weaknesses, alongside a launch day buff specifically for Vecna, he&#x27;s shaping up to be one of the stronger killers in the game when paired with the righ…</span>

While some can be easy to find, others prove more difficult due to their rarity. So, to help you with your search, here&#x27;s how to get and use the Group Abomination Tacet Core in Wuthering Waves.


Where to find Group Abomination Tacet Cores in Wuthering Waves


Group Abomination Tacet Cores can be found in the Mech Abomination domain in the Whining Aic&#x27;s Mire. Look to the southeast side of the map within the Court of Savantae Ruins to spot it.

The only catch is that you must complete a prerequisite quest first, as the Mech Abomination will be locked initially.

Minishoot&#x27; Adventures (apostrophe stays in the name) by two-person SoulGame Studio promises to be just that. You play as an adorable ship traversing a bright world taken over by the dastardly Unchosen, and saving your friends along the way.


It&#x27;s a neat premise for a bullet hell/metroidvania hybrid inspired by the top-down Legend of Zelda titles, and the game lives up to it.

Alhaitham’s best Quicken teams


As an on-field DPS, Alhaitham will rely on triggering Spread as many times as possible to deal the most damage. This means pairing him with off-field Electro teammates to trigger Quicken, which allows Alhaitham to trigger Spread. Fischl, Beidou, and Yae Miko are good offensive picks, while Kuki Shinobu makes for a good healer. Pick one or two Electro teammates to complement Alhaitham. 


Then, round out your team with a second Dendro unit. Nahida is the best in this slot, but you can also use Dendro Traveler. Baizhu and Yaoyao make for good Dendro healers if…</span>

                              <span>One of the trickier dailies to get in Warframe is to suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam melee attack. Since it’s not as easy as getting a collateral kill with something like an ability or AoE weapon, what’s the trick? We can help you get this below.


How to easily suspend 5 enemies in the air with a heavy slam attack in Warframe


You can do this challenge with most melee weapons in the game, but some make it easier than others. Typically, heavy weapons like hammers and heavy blades have larger heavy slam attack radiuses. 


You’ll also want to play missions that have high enemy density so there’s a higher likelihood of getting this challenge done easily. Here’s a list of missions with high enemy density:



Lua - Tycho


Lua - Yuvarium


Lua - Circulus 


Uranus - Ophelia


Sedna - Adaro


Deimos - Terrorem


Deimos - Persto


Deimos - Testudo



To make things even easier, you want to use frame abilities that can group enemies together. Using frames like Khora, Mag, Nidus, or Vauban can make this challenge trivial. 


If you do not have access to these frames, there are a lot of melee weapons with exceptional slam radiuses.

Every boss has different drops, with some materials coming from one specific creature. Some, like Unwarranted Feather, have completely unknown origins.


Can you find Unwarranted Feather in Wuthering Waves?


Currently, no &quot;Unwarranted Feather&quot; items are available in Wuthering Waves. There are two possibilities for this: it&#x27;s an unavailable item that&#x27;ll appear in Wuthering Wave&#x27;s 1.1 update alongside Yinlin, or it&#x27;s a mistranslation of the Dreamless Feather from the Statue of the Crownless: Heart boss.

                              <span>On the surface, Wuthering Wave&#x27;s combat system looks fairly simple, but it actually has a ton of nuance built into it that is not explained well, or at all, in-game. One such nuance is Swap Cancelling, and it is a necessity if you want to face the hardest content Wuthering Waves has to offer.


How to use Swap Cancelling in Wuthering Waves


Swap Cancelling is the act of performing an attack with one character, then immediately swapping to another, mid-animation, so that the first character&#x27;s attack still fully executes. This sequence can be performed on almost any attack in the game, though the best use of it is during ones with long animations. There are a few reasons with incredible benefits for performing successful swap cancels.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been trying to log into Destiny 2, you&#x27;ve likely encountered a significant roadblock. This is due to a crucial server downtime, a necessary step to prepare for the highly anticipated release of The Final Shape. So, if you&#x27;re eagerly awaiting to jump in, here&#x27;s how long Destiny 2 will be down.


Destiny 2 server downtime for The Final Shape, explained


Based on the Destiny Server and Update Status page, Destiny 2 will be offline until June 4 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET. That means the server downtime will last around 24 hours, starting on June 3 at 9 a.m. PT.

During this time, Destiny 2 players won&#x27;t be able to log in or participate in activities. An ongoing Destiny maintenance period will also last for a few more hours, ending around 12 p.m. PT on June 4. You&#x27;ll still be able to play the game two hours prior, but you may encounter some sign-on issues until the maintenance has concluded. In this case, players may be placed in a queue while it is active.


Once Destiny 2&#x27;s downtime is up, players can expect the launch of The Final Shape. The DLC drops at the same time and features a new campaign with an immeasurable number of unique challenges. Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it&#x27;s best to prepare during the downtime, just so you&#x27;re ready for launch.

With an IP that is familiar to people of all ages, beginners can focus on learning basic TCG mechanics and spend less time figuring out how to pronounce an ancient demon warlord’s middle name. 


Your first Lorcana purchase typically comes down to two options. Purchasing a starter deck allows you to jump into a game with a predetermined strategy and decklist. But if the starter decks available don’t resonate with you, you can buy a booster box and immediately have access to a large collection to build your own deck with.

When is The Acolyte premiering?


The Acolyte is set to premiere on Disney+ on Tuesday, June 4, 2024 at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET. Of course, these time zones only apply to the continental United States, and the two-episode premiere will happen a day later, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in countries like Great Britain.


When will new Acolyte episodes come out?


Like most live-action Star Wars shows, The Acolyte&#x27;s first season consists of eight episodes. As I mentioned above, the first two episodes will premiere back-to-back on Tuesday, June 4. The rest …</span>

But given the specifics of her kit, she can also be considered one of the game&#x27;s trickiest characters to build. 


So that you can unlock all of her potential and teach all on your path to stop judging a book by its cover, here&#x27;s the best Encore build in Wuthering Waves. 


The best weapons for Encore

The best weapon for Encore in Wuthering Waves is the 5-star Cosmic Ripples. The rectifier shines, given its high ATK and ability to buff her Energy Regen by 12.8%. 


Cosmic Ripples also allows her to boost her Basic Attack damage by 3.2% after hitting enemies with them. The buff can stack five times for a 1…</span>

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s played Warframe for a decent amount of time knows mods are the lifeblood of any gear piece . Weapons and frames can do okay on their own, but once you install the right mods and get them synergizing with each other, you can tear through even level 100-200 enemies with ease. 


One such mod can be slotted into any frame and provides great bonuses when dodging. Here&#x27;s how to get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe


To get the Rolling Guard mod in Warframe, you must first gain access to Arbitrations. This mode will unlock upon completing every node on the Star Chart, excluding the Jordas Golem and Mutalist Alad V Assassinate missions. Once done, the Arbitration node should appear on your Star Chart under the Operations window. When running these new missions, you want to look for Arbitration Shield Drones which, when killed, have a chance to drop Vitus Essence. You&#x27;ll also be granted Vitus Essence when completing these missions.

Once you have at least 20 Vitus Essence, head to any Relay and into the Arbiters of Hexis room, noted by a symbol on your minimap with a sword overlaying a shield. Inside you&#x27;ll find two NPCs, including one named Arbitration Honors. Speak with them, and you&#x27;ll be able to purchase the Rolling Guard mod for 20 Vitus Essence. You can also purchase a handful of other mods and goodies, though you&#x27;ll need more than 20 Vitus Essence naturally.


Is the Rolling Guard mod worth using?


At max rank, the Rolling Guard mod grants you invulnerability for three seconds and removes all Status Effects when dodging, with a seven-second cooldown. This makes it incredibly useful for tougher missions where Status Effects are spammed and is especially useful on Limbo. Provided you re-enter his rift after three seconds, you&#x27;ll have continuous protection against Status Effects.

When does Wuthering Waves 1.1 come out?


As per the official announcement from Kuro Games, mark your calendars for the release of Wuthering Waves 1.1 on June 28, 2024, at 05:59 (UTC+8). Like most updates, a server downtime is expected prior to this, so you can plan your game time accordingly.

Originally, Version 1.1, also known as Thaw of Eons, was supposed to launch a week after this. However, Kuro Games announced they would release it earlier to give players more content. Due to this change…</span>

As part of the Season 4 update, Raven Software slightly adjusted Warzone&#x27;s meta by buffing the FJX Horus, MCW, and AMR9. According to WZRanked all three weapons skyrocketed in popularity and are used in most Warzone matches. However, no weapon gets used more than the Kar98k, which leads the pack with a 20% pick rate. Season 4 brought back the beloved sniper rifle, and it dominates just as much as it did before, boasting a one-shot kill distance of 86 with the right set of attachments.

Likely to be the most significant action of its type ever in Belgium, the blocking measures coincide with a growing number of similar actions around Europe.

WayForward Technologies has worked on several well-known franchises over the years, including the likes of Contra, Silent Hill, The Mummy, Transformers, and even Aliens.

A new report from 404 Media claims that multiple Nintendo leaks from 2013-18 can be tied to a Google employee who had accessed Nintendo&#x27;s private YouTube videos.
The report is based on an internal Google database which has tracked &quot;six years worth of potential privacy and security issues&quot; including those reported by the company&#x27;s own employees.

Update 
They&#x27;re at it again. Midori (みどり) is back with another potential codename from Nintendo, and it sounds like it might be related to the Splatoon franchise.

                              <span>Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. &quot;You&quot; being the players who completed the metagame&#x27;s last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental &quot;Dark Fluid&quot; - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.
Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I&#x27;m sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.

                              <span>Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We&#x27;ll try to find out more. 
Original article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It&#x27;s surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I&#x27;m 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?

                              <span>In EA&#x27;s Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.
Megacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking &quot;AZ-TECH&quot; goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.

                              <span>Since the death of E3, June has descended into a chaotic clusterfunk of trailers, broadcasts, announcements, and a generalised frenzy of publicity-seeking barking noises. Summer Game Fest has emerged as a hub for a lot of developers seeking eyes. The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q &amp; A. &quot;There will be, definitely, new announcements,&quot; he said, &quot;but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.&quot; He&#x27;s mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure you could fill a bottomless pit with the things Larian decided not to add to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. One of those things was, in fact, a bottomless pit. Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.

                              <span>If you love cosy games where the biggest challenge is choosing between which farm utensil to place next to your barn doors, then Tiny Glade may be just the game for you. It&#x27;s a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.

Instead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you&#x27;ll soon lament that you can&#x27;t actually live inside your glorious creations. I&#x27;ve played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you&#x27;ll find some thoughts from my time with it below.

                              <span>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It&#x27;s operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The &quot;shells&quot; in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below.

Jumping G.K&#x27;s Game-a-Palooza. The AAAArghs. The Second Fall Of Babel. Trailarmageddon. The Sparkling Stink. SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with their latest State of Play showcase, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I&#x27;ll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

                              <span>The remake of Riven, the sequel to Myst, arrives on June 25. This modernized version of the 1997 PC classic has been rebuilt from the ground up and is coming to PC and VR headsets.
Riven has been reimagined by its original creators at Cyan Worlds. The game now boasts full freedom of movement, updated gameplay, improved graphics, and reworked puzzles. It also introduces new content through characters, challenges, and storytelling.
See it in action in the game&#x27;s new trailer below: 


Riven will be available on PC, Mac, and Meta Quest 2 and 3.

                              <span>After teasing PC support tests earlier this year, the PC adapter for PlayStation VR2 arrives this August, the company has revealed. More specifically, the device will cost $59.99 and hit select retailers and PlayStation&#x27;s online store starting August 7. With this device, you can use the PlayStation VR2 hardware to play SteamVR games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx. 
Ironically, PlayStation gamers have been asking for a Half-Life: Alyx port for PlayStation VR (and now PlayStation VR2) for years. Though that still isn&#x27;t happening, this PC adapter at least allows players to use their PlayStation VR2 device to play the game through Steam. They can do the same with hundreds of other SteamVR games, like Fallout 4 VR and War Thunder.

                              <span>It’s been a while since we last got an update on Metal Slug Tactics, the turn-based strategy spin-off of the popular side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up. The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.
The new video shows off the game&#x27;s spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.


Metal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game&#x27;s soundtrack. 
When first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC. Today&#x27;s trailer confirms that it&#x27;s also coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</span>

                              <span>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is making the leap to Xbox in August. The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.
As the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. 
Kena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+


We awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, &quot;Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.&quot; The game was also a sales success, recouping its development costs a month after its initial release in September 2021.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase is happening this week, on Friday, June 7, at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and with more than 55 studios and publishers set to be featured at the event (including Play Days this weekend) this year, fans have been speculating on what they might see. That includes Kingdom Hearts fans, who have been hoping to see something related to Kingdom Hearts IV at SGF this year, given it&#x27;s been more than two years since its reveal. 
However, SGF host and creator Geoff Keighley thinks Kingdom Hearts fans should lower their expectations for the show. 
&quot;People keep asking about Kingdom Hearts, I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; Keighley says during a recent stream where he answered questions about SGF. &quot;I think it&#x27;s because we did [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] last year or something like that. But yeah, people are setting themselves up for failure but you guys can keep hoping.&quot; 
Here&#x27;s a clip of it, too:

Now, Keighley could be playing coy, especially with the &quot;but you guys can keep hoping&quot; part at the end, but it&#x27;s more likely that he&#x27;s trying to nicely let Kingdom Hearts fans know that if they expect to see Kingdom Hearts IV during SGF, they might be disappointed. 
In the meantime, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura about Kingdom Hearts IV, the series&#x27; future with Final Fantasy, and more.

                              <span>Naughty Dog won&#x27;t be The Last of Us studio forever, according to studio president Neil Druckmann. He told the LA Times this in a new interview, which is where he also said the studio has multiple single-player projects in development, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.
&quot;I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever,&quot; Druckmann said, revealing the team is working on &quot;multiple single-player projects.&quot; He continued, adding, &quot;We create experiences that are steeped in story and characters, especially relationships. The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.&quot;


Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann told the LA Times he came up with the idea about a man and a girl crossing a post-apocalyptic landscape – the premise of …</span>

Tentokrát se strahováci podívají na zoubek velmi slibně vypadajícímu open-source EDM projektu - ne, nejde o taneční hudbu, ale o elektroobrábění. Ukáží taky, jak vypadá starší cykloradar zevnitř nebo jak se testuje odolnost iPhonů.

Když už se mluví o hardwaru, je tu nová soutěž od Hackaday, ve které jde o nápady, které se vejdou do velikosti klasické vizitky. Ukáží i pár levných blbinek z Číny včetně bezdrátové tiskárny nebo antén pro blízké pole.

Ze softwarových témat stojí za zmínku nová ROM pro československý počítač Ondra nebo jak aktuálně probíhá hackování nedávno vydaného multitasking MS-DOSu.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 4. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>Spain&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior says eight people have been arrested after police dismantled a €5.3m pirate IPTV network serving local expats. Authorities aren&#x27;t naming the service but if the name TVMucho rings any bells, people are on the right track. That police identified the owner of the service is no surprise. The Dutchman has never hidden away and has continuously claimed his service operates legally. If only in part, it&#x27;s still streaming channels right now.

Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they&#x27;re ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.

A bunch of us have recently returned from trips down to the Brighton office to meet some new faces. Weird to think I&#x27;m now the most far-flung of the lot, living way up here in Glasgow. Maybe that&#x27;s why I elected to take over these Playing This Weekend posts, to help fill the friendless void growing inside my heart.
So just know that if you don&#x27;t sound off in the comments below with news of what you&#x27;re playing this weekend, the void in my heart will grow, until one day it consumes me. And then who will write these posts? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda is arguably the most consistently unique game designer in the industry. He created Killer7, the No More Heroes series, worked with James Gunn (before he directed Guardians of the Galaxy or was put in charge of DC films) on Lollipop Chainsaw, and lots more. In preparation for his role as the keynote speaker at MomoCon this year, we caught up with him over e-mail to discuss his next game, Hotel Barcelona (a collaboration with Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka &quot;Swery65&quot; Suehiro), remastering his 2011 game Shadows of the Damned, Batman, and more.
Game Informer: Hotel Barcelona is inspired by horror films. Are there specific films you cite as references?
Goichi &quot;Suda51&quot; Suda: There are a lot of them. Swery of White Owls is the main creator, so you should probably ask him …</span>

If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re getting older. Right now, at this moment, you&#x27;re older than you were when you started reading this sentence. And this one. No, you can&#x27;t go back and read it again to get younger. Time marches on, so thank you for spending your precious seconds on this silly intro. We&#x27;ll get to the point.
&#x27;Retro games&#x27; — how do you classify them? Do you count years, generations, or is there some other personal metric you use to delineate between what&#x27;s &#x27;old&#x27; in the realm of video games? Do you need to be able to count the pixels with the naked eye?

Overmorrow, the debut release from solo developer PixelManta, manages to be philosophically interesting, is evocatively written, visually distinct, and lovingly crafted. Yet, the notion of re-playing it – which you’ll effectively need to do by design – is a tall order, and therein lies the unfortunate problem with this otherwise commendable maiden indie effort.
When we reported on Overmorrow’s central mechanic of a player’s save data being deleted after 30 in-game days, the comment section was abuzz with discussion over the merits of such game design.

Looking back on this week, it&#x27;s kinda felt like a bit of a quieter one, but we&#x27;ve still had some pretty sizeable news items drop. The top story this week was undoubtedly the reveal of the new Lego set based on the Legend of Zelda franchise&#x27;s Deku Tree; it&#x27;s an expensive one, but a beautiful one.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that online piracy presents a major challenge to copyright holders. With owners of pirate sites largely unresponsive, search engines and other online intermediaries are often asked to intervene. With a starring role for anti-piracy company Link-Busters, Google has seen a significant surge in takedown requests, one that has set new records on the way.

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Toys for Bob, the developer of Crash Bandicoot 4 and the Skylanders series, has announced a publishing deal with Xbox for its next game. The studio recently went independent after splitting off from its former parent company, Activision Blizzard.
The studio states its new title is &quot;very early in development&quot; and that we won&#x27;t see it for some time. Whatever this game is, Xbox will be its home, which isn&#x27;t surprising since the studio teased it was exploring a relationship with the publisher a couple of months ago.
We&#x27;re excited to announce that we&#x27;ll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. We&#x27;re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we&#x27;re working hard on an experience we&#x27;re so sooo inspired about!

Toys For Bob went independent in February, a few months after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard. The studio is seemingly getting to have its cake and eat it too, since it still gets to work with Xbox while being an autonomous entity. Prior to leaving Activision, Toys For Bob worked on the recent Crash Bandicoot games such as Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time and Crash Team Rumble. It also developed the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and created the once-wildly popular Skylanders series.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

                              <span>Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Grinding Gear Game showed off a new gameplay trailer for Path of Exile 2, revealing that the long-awaited sequel will enter early access in late 2024. The trailer also announced the game is heading to PS5.


Path of Exile 2 on console will introduce couch co-op and supports cross-play and cross-progression. Despite Sony not having an official early access program, the game will be playable on the platform when early access begins on PC. As with the first game, Path of Exile 2 is a free-to-play action RPG that was first announced a few years ago.</span>

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot; 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 


Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.</span>

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today&#x27;s State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation&#x27;s recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while &quot;tentpole&quot; single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game&#x27;s Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: &quot;You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.&quot;
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console&#x27;s 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game&#x27;s world and tone played, and it&#x27;s here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we&#x27;ll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord&#x27;s gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2&#x27;s PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game&#x27;s roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you&#x27;ll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game&#x27;s simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

Announced a few weeks back, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That&#x27;s in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.

Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

                              <span>So ends another month of the RPS Game Club, which means another chance to gather together and swap video game opinions like scary stories ‘round the campfire. The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

                              <span>YouTuber Albino si stěžuje na automatickou kontrolu autorských práv na YouTube. Když streamoval Fallout, jeho pračka Samsung dokončila cyklus a zahrála melodii. Tato melodie byla vyhodnocena jako porušení autorských práv, protože se shoduje s nahrávkou od uživatele Audego starou devět let. Což je vlastně přesně nahraná melodie pračky Samsung. Ke klipu však Audego připojil Content ID, tedy označil jej za vlastní výtvor.</span>

                              <span>Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company&#x27;s first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we&#x27;re inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant&#x27;s leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

                              <span>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise&#x27;s original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game&#x27;s new mechanics and features here.</span>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation&#x27;s dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation&#x27;s single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it&#x27;s part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


&quot;Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here,&quot; Hulst said. &quot;On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its &quot;Game &amp; Network Services Segment&quot; presentation from PlayStation&#x27;s two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it&#x27;s made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it&#x27;s the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

                              <span>Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be &quot;showing the world of Minecraft in a new light&quot; and feature an original story with new characters.


This won&#x27;t be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.</span>

My personal reputation is great only among people who love mushrooms and hate deer. It&#x27;s been long enough that I should probably be a fierce warlord running a large chunk of the kingdom in opposition by now, but instead, I have the skillset of fifty peasants, and the outstanding work of fifty three. And I know why. Bellwright has taught me what I already knew in theory, but had not truly appreciated:
Good managers are rare and precious. And I&#x27;m not one of them.

Apple had just released their new electric barnacle scrubber, and sailors everywhere were trading sacks of freshly minted coins just for a solitary sweet sniff at one of the delightfully compact and sleekly designed charger cables. Of course, too-many-toes Jackson and myself had seen tell of this upcoming gold rush, written in crab trails on the sand, which is what we had instead of the stock market in them days.

                              <span>Kill Knight, the silly-named twin stick action game you may have caught at similarly silly-named event The Triple-I Initiative in April, is joining this year&#x27;s Steam next fest with a demo ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

                              <span>Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month&#x27;s lightning rod for hype. But it&#x27;s worth dissecting what it&#x27;s actually like to play.

By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

                              <span>With an effectively infinite universe to fill in No Man’s Sky, developers Hello Games have certainly risen to the challenge of trying to fill it with as much stuff as they possibly can over the last near-decade, still managing to add major new features and modes eight years on from the sci-fi exploration game’s release. Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.

We still don’t know what the team’s new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who’ll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.

Each harvest, one villager must don the ceremonial, mildly magical mask, and enter the fields alone, to gather the precious life-giving ambrosia before the beast can befoul it. For five nights you must do battle, or evade its ravenous clutches.
Those of you who have known your own Devourer are surely thinking: Only five nights per year? Luxury. Harvest Hunt is good, though.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

                              <span>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called &quot;bullet heaven,&quot; puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro&#x27;s Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon&#x27;s Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</span>

With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus&#x27; custom dungeon to show off some of the game&#x27;s toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

                              <span>Kubernetes je spíše spjat s provozem aplikací, které nevyžadují úložiště, tzv. stateless. Jejich provoz je jednodušší, snáze se škálují a obecně rychleji startují. Nicméně, občas je úložiště potřeba a přesně o tom bude další Cloud Native Prague meetup s tématem zvaným Stateful Kubernetes.</span>

AlmaLinux 8.10 tak víceméně dělá pro systémové správce strojů s těmito řadiči zhruba totéž, co AlmaLinux 9.4 oproti RHELu 9.4, navíc s tím bonusem, že se mohou nadále držet „osmičkové“ řady.

                              <span>Cox Communications has filed its opening brief in a new appeal of the $1 billion piracy case. A jury previously held the Internet provider liable for the music piracy activities of its subscribers. After the trial, Cox learned that the music companies &#x27;concealed&#x27; key information about &#x27;destroyed&#x27; piracy evidence; this allegedly damaged the foundation of the landmark lawsuit.

                              <span>Billed as the most advanced anti-piracy system ever, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield had no chance of living up to the hype. It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing &quot;services to pirates&quot; that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

                              <span>In the vast Wuthering Waves-shaped shadow that has descended across gaming comes an announcement from HoYoverse, publishers of quite large gacha gubbins &#x27;em up, Genshin Impact. The studio&#x27;s follow-up Zenless Zone Zero is now set to release on July 4th. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet heard of the bright cyberpunk character action game, I guess now&#x27;s your chance to look at the slick anime visuals in the new trailer below and go &quot;hmmm&quot;, with either a songful note of eye-widening interest or the suspicious rumble of a free-to-play skeptic.  Your choice.

                              <span>Resident Evils Code Veronica and 0 will be the next entries in the survival horror series to get the remake treatment, according to rumours. “A remake of Resident Evil Zero &amp; Code Veronica in development right now,” claimed user Dusk Golem on Le Epic Musk Zone. The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

                              <span>At intervals in our relentless battles with the Maw, we lose people. Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week&#x27;s new PC games of note.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.
First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

                              <span>One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don&#x27;t know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, &quot;The truth lies.&quot; The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders&#x27; black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.

                              <span>Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games&#x27; versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego&#x27;s website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.</span>

                              <span>Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, &quot;Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we&#x27;ll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.&quot;
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise&#x27;s next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it&#x27;s possible we may learn what&#x27;s next for that game.</span>

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

                              <span>In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

                              <span>I woke up this morning and put on a white Hanes t-shirt mass-produced by a machine able to produce clothing at a rate no human ever could. But shirts like this used to be made by humans. While making coffee, I ask Siri on my iPhone what the weather will be like today and what my day’s schedule looks like, and a few seconds later, an artificial intelligence-powered voice gives me the answers I’m looking for. After sitting down at my work computer to write this, I opened Spotify and checked out my Discover Weekly playlist, hyper-curated to my tastes based on the other music I’ve listened to over the past week.
On Instagram, my ads feel uncannily targeted to me, and on X (formerly Twitter), I see a new batch of posters for Amazon’s upcoming Fallout streaming series called out for using A.I. N…</span>

                              <span>The final character of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Year 1 DLC plans, Akuma, finally hit the game earlier this week. I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6&#x27;s case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

He shared the recipe for a Cuban dish – the Arroz con Pollo – in an in-game radio station in Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and it’s one that he describes as “very controversial.” The trick, according to Douglas, a senior writer at Night School Studio, is to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the dish instead of bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks.
“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way. I’m genuinely afraid of telling her this.”

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse. Frostpunk 2 picks up the story 30 years later and, in the process, looks to impr…</span>

Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court.

Three years have passed since then, but we’ve finally had an update on the remake - and it’s raised a few questions, to say the least.

                              <span>The next Doom game - the first new instalment in over four years, after Doom Eternal - is reportedly taking a leaf out of Evil Dead: Army of Darkness’ necronomicon by transporting the Doom Slayer back to a medieval world to presumably battle hellspawn. According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.

                              <span>The director of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and CEO of developers Larian has revealed that the studio experienced crunch in order to get the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons CRPG finished. While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn&#x27;t [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).

If you were hoping to task your descendants with continuing your quest to get all 1,700-plus achievements in Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal or maintain your ranked leaderboard position in Dota 2, bad news: it turns out that you can’t pass on your Steam library after you die.

                              <span>A Seattle jury has issued a landmark verdict following the legal battle between &#x27;Destiny 2&#x27; creator Bungie and cheat seller AimJunkies. The &#x27;cheat&#x27; company and its three owners are liable for copyright infringement and must pay damages to Bungie. The same applies to an independent cheat developer whose counterclaim, alleging that Bungie &#x27;hacked&#x27; his computer, was denied.

                              <span>The seemingly endless possibilities of generative AI are not on an unavoidable collision course with copyright law; the collision happened way back and sooner or later, someone will have to pick up the bill. In the meantime, popular LLMs seem to be developing a stubborn, pro-copyright streak, partly due to all the industry propaganda they&#x27;ve been consuming. But don&#x27;t fight back, it&#x27;s time to team up.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory&#x27;s foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

The feature is available in the software &quot;UFC Ripper&quot; and its developer hopes that Dana White will allow the tool to exist.

                              <span>Operation Creative is a multi-agency anti-piracy initiative led by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, also known as PIPCU. The primary aim is to shut down pirate sites but if that proves elusive, depriving sites of advertising revenue by placing them on a blacklist is seen as the next best thing. The Infringing Website List (IWL) isn&#x27;t made public but since there was no celebration of its recent 10-year anniversary, here&#x27;s what the decade-old list has been getting up to lately.

                              <span>Wuthering Waves is the latest open-world RPG gacha game to follow in the wake of the likes of Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, but Kuro Games’ free-to-play offering has had to deal with a bit of a wobbly launch over the last couple of days, leading the studio to scramble to address login problems, detail additional upcoming improvements and offer players some in-game games as means of apology.

                              <span>The Sims 4 is fast approaching its 10th birthday this September, a fact that genuinely instilled me with the crushing sense of time marching relentlessly on when I checked its release date a moment ago. That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

Well, now we know that this season&#x27;s wasteland offerings take the form of a sort of Mad Max meets Fallout meets Borderlands- battle royale affair. There&#x27;s a big emphasis on deserts and vehicles, basically, with highlights including: mechanical fists, turrets on cars, and the possibility of manning one of two War Buses that patrol the reworked map.

                              <span>Calling it now: this is the least intriguing article you will read about 11 bit&#x27;s The Alters, a blend of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine and Duncan Jones&#x27;s Moon in which (deep breath) you are a marooned space engineer who must spawn different versions of himself by means of backstory-branching gadgetry in order to operate an enormous, rolling base and escape the apocalyptic rays of the local sun. 


We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

                              <span>Activision have celebrated my birthday in the traditional manner by announcing a new Call Of Duty game. Said Call Of Duty game is Black Ops 6, &quot;a dark new chapter&quot; in the Treyarch-helmed FPS sub-series which is known for seedier and weirder, alt-historical or post-future stories featuring hallucinations and cybernetics and catchy period music.

                              <span>The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year’s ROG Ally handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at Videocardz. I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under &quot;News James wants to be true.&quot;

Warhammer is big, so it needs must have multiple of them, hence their yearly event Skulls, which collates a bunch of Games Workshop related announcements into a sort of bizzaro world Nintendo Direct if Yoshi was actually a parasitic corpse emperor. There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.

                              <span>Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare&#x27;s first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it&#x27;s not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

                              <span>In Anthology of the Killer you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

                              <span>Sometimes you gotta know when to fold, and trying to get new hotness RPG Wuthering Waves to play nice with the Steam Deck has got me creasing like an origami crane. While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.

                              <span>Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you&#x27;re dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

                              <span>At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name &quot;Alice&quot; you don&#x27;t just say &quot;oh hi&quot; like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, &quot;Alice&quot;. An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

                              <span>We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You&#x27;re likely confused, and that&#x27;s understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

                              <span>I could pretend I understand Square Enix&#x27;s action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don&#x27;t need to, &#x27;cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don&#x27;t properly understand it), wasn&#x27;t on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn&#x27;t watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

                              <span>Risk Of Rain 2 is one of my fave action roguelikes, as it&#x27;s a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That&#x27;s why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there&#x27;s a new map, too.

                              <span>The neighbourhood citizens of Life By You are positioning themselves as bright-eyed pretenders to The Sims. But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. &quot;[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead,&quot; said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, &quot;rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.&quot;

                              <span>To borrow a tired Xitterism: The Venn diagram between ‘games that have reference points outside of other games’ and ‘games I’m likely to get excited about’ is a circle. For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.

                              <span>Flashy action-RPG Stellar Blade looks like it could be the next PlayStation 5 exclusive to find its way over to PC, as developers Shift Up say they’re pondering a PC release. They’re also thinking about a sequel - probably not much of a surprise given the first game has sold well on just the one platform, by all accounts - while working on a new game that should also be headed to PC, codenamed Project Witches.

Its strategy fundamentals were already strong enough to impress me in 2022 that it&#x27;s been quite tricky to even remember what&#x27;s changed. But there&#x27;s more of it, and although after much reflection I think it&#x27;s not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

                              <span>Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

                              <span>There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.
