                              <span>One more chance to try Wo Long out
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty arrives pretty soon, but if you&#x27;re still unsure or just want to play more of it, there will be one more chance before release. A final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo is going live on February 24, 2023.
Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja&#x27;s new action-RPG will have this demo for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty up from Feb. 24 through March 26, 2023. The new and final demo will be available on all systems it&#x27;s releasing on too, which are Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC.
The final demo will feature Chapter 1: Village of Calamity and Chapter 2: Two Chivalrous Heroes. This start from the earlier chapters of the game is also good for prospective buyers, as save data can transfer over to the main game. Doing this will also net you the &quot;Crouching Dragon Helmet&quot; item.

Online multiplayer will also be available in the final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo. And a special launch window &quot;Baihu Armor&quot; has been revealed for anyone who gets the game by March 16, alongside the digital pre-order &quot;Zhuque Armor&quot; bonus.
Dynasty warriors
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has been quietly creeping up lists for games to keep an eye on this year. The latest action-RPG from Team Ninja does seem to carry on ideas from Nioh, while set in the Three Kingdoms era of China.
While FromSoftware is well known for its ability to craft a punishing fantasy action-RPG, Team NInja has been honing its own skills within the genre. And from the impression we had with a recent hands-on, it seems like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is coming together to be a surprise hit for those who haven&#x27;t been keeping an eye on it.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is out on March 3 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

                              <span>I like my swords like I like my future...
Devolver Digital has announced that it will be bringing is More8Bit’s lo-fi action-adventure title to Switch and PC this year in Bleak Sword DX. While the title has been on Apple Arcade since 2019, Bleak Sword DX promises to be an “upgraded and definitive” version.
If you missed it because you don’t have phone, Bleak Sword is a diorama-style slasher that drops your pixelated self into action setpieces. True to its name, Bleak Sword features dark fantasy rendered in stylized pixel art, giving it an unnerving lo-fi feel. Rather than a cohesive adventure, each level is represented as a battle on a square of land.

You can play a Bleak Sword DX demo now
The demo is available as part of Steam Next Fest. I fired it up and gave it a playthrough in preparation for writing this. While you can see its retro roots in its rapid-fire pick-up-and-play design, its combat feels more akin to something like Tunic. You watch enemy patterns, roll out of the way, and parry when it feels safe to. The brief levels and simplistic foundation leave a bit to be desired, but it’s definitely not a bad experience at first impression. Notably, the soundtrack is done by Jim Guthrie, which is always a big draw for me.
Bleak Sword DX features a new mode with extra chapters and new level layouts. Beyond that, there are randomizer and boss rush modes. The visuals have also been tweaked to better fit the new platforms it finds itself on. The AI is “enhanced,” and there are additions to the combat system (like the aforementioned parry.)
Bleak Sword is currently available on iOS through Apple arcade. Bleak Sword DX will be available on Switch and PC later in 2023. Currently, you can try out the first chapter in the demo for Steam Next Fest.

                              <span>What will the next few years bring for Nintendo?
As we wait to see what Nintendo has up their sleeve next in terms of hardware, fans have endlessly created concepts based on that speculation. Not only have they come up with mockups for brand new systems; they&#x27;ve also crafted incredible official-looking spinoffs of existing hardware.
That includes this &quot;Switch Lite OLED&quot; (from Redditor willierthanyou) themed after the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Would you buy a Switch Lite OLED?
So far, Nintendo has released a Switch Lite, and a Switch OLED: but not a Switch Lite OLED. There&#x27;s no such limitations in mockup land though, as this Switch Lite OLED goes with the color scheme from the logo (and the general aesthetic of the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sheikah tech). The back is adorned with a Triforce symbol, along with a cool little neon effect. Since it&#x27;s a Switch Lite, the Joy-Con do not detach.
The same creator also dabbled in a custom Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Joy-Con mockup (as well as a Switch Dock) if you&#x27;re interested in these designs. More of their designs can be found on their Instagram account if you dig them!
It&#x27;s just a matter of time until Nintendo unveils more official creations for all of their AAA games coming this year. For now, we can enjoy some more works from the community.

Overwatch 2 now has custom game moderation and &quot;disruptive voice chat detection&quot;
This is the big one. The workshop system and custom games have been causing issues since launch, and Blizzard is trying to &quot;provide ways to make sure custom games remain safe and enjoyable for all players.&quot; Moderation tools will &quot;automatically remove custom games containing inappropriate titles or content,&quot; while penalizing accounts that do so.

Daedalic Entertainment has announced it has teamed up with Spitfire Interactive to create Capes, a turn-based super-hero strategy game coming to consoles and PC sometime this year. Spitfire Interactive is a developer formed by members of Defiant Development, creators of Hand of Fate. Perhaps more notably, the team is being headed by Morgan Jaffit, who was a member of Irrational Games during the development of one of the turn-based super-hero genre’s earliest members, 2002’s Freedom Force.
Capes takes place in a world where evil has long since triumphed, and the development of super-powers is illegal. Keep that in mind next time you forget to take the tinfoil off a baked potato before microwaving it or peel the do-not-remove tag off a mattress. You mig…</span>

February is a packed month, and part of that is due to the Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion arriving in a few weeks. Before that happens Reddit user goboy3133 has done a public service of sorts: sharing the contents of the Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition with the world.
Bungie is no stranger to esoteric puzzles and scavenger hunts, and we&#x27;re getting another one in the Collector&#x27;s Edition itself. Beyond story bits (including Vanguard Reports on various story facets dealing with Osiris, Calus, and Elsie, all of which are available to read in the above link), Bungie has also hidden redemption codes for Destiny 2 emblems in the Collector&#x27;s Edition reports.
As usual the community answered the call, and uncovered all of them. If you want to grab the Destiny 2: Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition for yourself and figure out the puzzles within: stop here!
All Destiny 2 Lightfall Collectors Edition emblem codes
Note that the first code can only be redeemed once (typically by the owner of the Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition). The rest can be used openly, and goboy3133 has created instant-redemption Bungie.net links for them, which can be found below. I tried them out myself: they work! You just need to sign into Bungie.net with the platform of your choice, and you&#x27;re good to go. If the links don&#x27;t work for whatever reason, you can enter them manually here.

Tonight is the biggest night and music, and for composer Stephanie Economou, it might be one of the biggest nights of her career. The seasoned musician was one of five people up for a Grammy this year for video game music. This is the first year the category has been a part of the show, and given how instrumental music is to the gaming industry and how easy it is to access your favorite scores on Spotify and Apple Music, one would hope it will be here for many years to come. The award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, which is the award&#x27;s official name, was handed out in the Grammy&#x27;s pre-show, going to Economou for her work on the score soundtrack for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok.
Dawn of Ragnarok is the expansion for AC Valhalla that was released in March of last year to decent reviews. Clearly, the music from the game was more than just decent as Economou managed to take the gramophone over some pretty tough competition. Other nominees including in this inaugural batch were Austin Wintory for Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Christopher Tin for Old World.
Expect to see Bear McCreary up for this award again next year with his work on the Game Award-winning score to God of War: Ragnarok. Here&#x27;s to hoping with this category around, we&#x27;ll start seeing every video game publisher releasing their scores and soundtracks commercially. I know I would appreciate having the entirety of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 soundtrack at the ready for when I take my walks every day.

                              <span>It takes a particular type of farming game to really hook me in these days, but Lightyear Frontier&#x27;s crop-planting mechs might just be the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for. Everything I&#x27;ve seen of Frame Break&#x27;s futuristic life sim looks delightful so far, and in a recent ID@Xbox showcase, the developers told us a bit more about how it&#x27;s going to operate, and whether those Stardew Valley comparisons are on the money. 
When asked whether players would be able to befriend NPCs like other Stardew-likes, Frame Break&#x27;s CEO Joakim Hedström told us: &quot;In short, yes. We don&#x27;t have a full town like Stardew, but the characters that are there, you&#x27;ll be able to get to know better and learn their stories.&quot;

Today, there&#x27;s another one-day sale on the drive, this time at $104.99 - an incredible value for an SSD of this spec.

                              <span>One of Intel&#x27;s best budget gaming CPUs, the Core i5 13400F, is down to £189 at Tech Next Day in the UK - compared to £238 for the cheapest 12400/12400F model on Amazon UK. This is a great price for this level of performance, with a 10-core and 16-thread design, max turbo frequency of 4.6GHz and of course the same socket 1700 compatibility as other 12th and 13th-gen Intel CPUs. 
Note that to get this price, you&#x27;ll need to use code TND-10 at the checkout - a long-running code that seems to apply to other products as well, FYI.

                              <span>A new week means one thing: another update on Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. According to a report from The New York Times, Microsoft is expecting the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to oppose the deal, after EU regulators issued their own antitrust warnings last week. Microsoft reportedly believes it can convince EU and UK regulators to accept their concessions and eventually approve the acquisition.

As I&#x27;ve said before, a lot of them can&#x27;t quite match the OG for all manner of reasons, but Spellbook Demonslayers is different. Despite only being in early access, it&#x27;s already got a solid foundation to work from. No, there isn&#x27;t an Old Testament that whirls around your person like a holy sawblade, but there is a revolving shield with a pistol glued onto it. Yeah, I thought that would convince you.

At a recent ID@Xbox showcase we attended last week, creative director and Wishfully co-founder Adam Stjärnljus acknowledged that Playdead connection, saying that both Limbo and Inside &quot;had a huge impact on me&quot;. But he also said Studio Ghibli&#x27;s animated film Spirited Away was another key influence, which, yep, that definitely tracks. 
&quot;I was very inspired by Studio Ghibli films, and especially the film Spirited Away,&quot; Stjärnljus told us. &quot;That&#x27;s been kind of like a guiding star from the beginning in terms of tonality with this serious, emotional story, but [also] still, like, a fun quirkiness to it, and really this sense of exploring another world, which we really want.&quot;

                              <span>After two years of early access, the spacefaring looter shooter Everspace 2 is ready to fly into full release for PC on April 6th. Last November, the open-world sequel received its last major update before release, adding in a rift-opening endgame. The game already has grappling hooks - which automatically makes every shooter better - so, now we’re just waiting for a few extra bits before it’s ready for takeoff.

                              <span>The RPS Time Capsule returns for its first outing of 2023, and this time we&#x27;re casting our minds back to the hallowed year of 2006. Little did we know it at the time, but this is the year we start to see the birth of certain game series that are still alive and kicking today (just about), as well as the nascent beginnings of now beloved studios honing their craft on some of their very first titles. But which of those games have earned themselves a spot in the eternal RPS Time Capsule? Come and find out which ones have stood the test of time, and which, after reading this article, have been consigned to the smog-filled trashfire of future Earth.

This week, my eye has been caught by a walking witch hut, using a shotgun to rocket-jump, some Dark Messiah-style kicking baddies into spikes, and unusual animal encounters. Come see!

                              <span>I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.
In practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you&#x27;re approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That&#x27;s all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.

Starting today until next Friday, February 17th, it&#x27;s Magic Week here at RPS, where we aim to highlight all manner of fabulous games about magic, witches, wizards, general sorcery and other spell-adjacent tomfoolery. We&#x27;re also putting special emphasis on magic games made by trans developers, too. Join us for a glimpse of what&#x27;s coming up.

                              <span>After its launch in October of last year, Overwatch 2 is ready to kick off its third season of content on February 7. This season delivers several facets of new content, including a new Antarctica Control map, Asian Mythology theme, and a Kiriko Mythic skin. On top of that, Blizzard announced some unexpected additions to its Overwatch offerings, including the first IP collaboration as well as a web-based game to coincide with Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Antarctica joins the map rotation in Season 3. While players are already familiar with Earth&#x27;s least-populated continent through Ecopoint: Antarctica, this map features unique locations, including an ice-breaker ship and an underground drilling station. The map allows players to take the high-ground or sneaky flank routes to reach their objectives.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Grammy awards ceremony was the first ever to include a category for the best score soundtrack for a video game, and last year&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla expansion, Dawn of Ragnarok, took home the win. 
More specifically, the DLC&#x27;s composer, Stephanie Economou, won the Grammy for her score in the game. Her other credits include Netflix&#x27;s Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked &quot;all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,&quot; thanking them for &quot;acknowledging and validating the power of game music.&quot; 


Variety also reports that prior to this year&#x27;s Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show&#x27;s score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012&#x27;s Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Economou&#x27;s Grammy was awarded during the main show&#x27;s pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game&#x27;s name last night is any indication.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has confirmed that Nina Williams will be in the Tekken 8 roster. 
This news comes from a new gameplay reveal trailer that confirms Nina Williams as a playable fighter in the forthcoming game alongside footage of some new and returning moves.

We know there are a lot of Metroidvanias out there. But after spending about three hours with Afterimage, we&#x27;re pretty confident in saying that this is one of the prettiest we&#x27;ve ever played. Even before we got our hands on the game, Afterimage stood out to us with its stunning hand-drawn visuals. Even next to the likes of Hollow Knight, Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, Islets, and Indivisible, it&#x27;s a real feast for the eyes with its beautiful locations, gorgeous character art, and soft colours. Seeing it in motion only made us fall in love with the visuals even more.
As part of Modus Games&#x27; spring showcase, we were given the opportunity to check out a PC demo of this Metroidvania from developer Aurogon Shanghai. Afterimage smashed through its Kickstarter goal last April, and it&#x27;s coming to Switch (plus Steam and other consoles) on 25th April 2023.

Bleak Sword released on Apple Arcade back in 2019 and has since gone on to receive positive reviews across the board.

For those who have never come across the game in its original form before, allow us to fill you in. Developed by studio more8bit, Bleak Sword sees you making your way through a series of chapters (nine in the mobile game, 12 this time around) to lift a curse by disposing of any monsters, creatures or any other beasties that come your way.

CAVE Co. Ltd, the pioneering, god-tier arcade developer that reignited the shooting game genre in the &#x27;90s, has a portfolio to die for. After 17 years of cast-iron quality and unceasing invention, the sound of gunfire finally rang silent in 2012 with their swansong, Dodonpachi SaiDaiOuJou.
Among Cave’s output, only a few entries are regarded as black sheep. Progear (2001) and Akai Katana (2010) share a kinship of sorts. Both were salient horizontal scrollers among a host of verticals, and neither were hits on release. Directed by Shinobu Yagawa (Battle Garegga), Akai Katana is the most Cave-like of his creations and one of the easier titles on his resume.

GoldenEye 007&#x27;s release on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack (and Xbox) has stirred up a lot of talk among us video game enthusiasts, and naturally, Digital Foundry is weighing in on the situation.
Dropping on the service just over a week ago, both the Xbox and NSO versions have come under a lot of flack for the controls, emulation quality, and more. And John Linneman of DF has taken it upon himself to find out what the issues are.

It has been a good few years now since we last checked in with everyone&#x27;s favourite fox fighter pilot in Star Fox Zero (seven years, to be precise) and the chances of him returning to the Switch seem to lessen everyday. In the ensuing period while we wait (fingers tightly crossed) for news of a series reboot, the good folk over on the DidYouKnowGaming? YouTube channel have been digging into one of the series&#x27; cancelled titles at Retro Studios.
In its most recent video, the channel got a chance to talk to Eric Kozlowsky, a former Retro Studios artist, who had pitched a game titled &#x27;Star Fox Armada&#x27; back in early 2013. While the studio would eventually pass on the title, Kozlowsky shared his 24-page pitch document with the channel and discussed many of the game&#x27;s proposed features.

HBO&#x27;s adaptation of The Last of Us has been receiving rave reviews since its debut in January - deservedly so - with critics and audiences alike praising the show for its faithful take on the franchise along with its bold deviations (hello, episode 3!).
It&#x27;s clearly gotten some folks wondering just what else could potentially receive the &#x27;gritty&#x27; adaptation. Thanks to Saturday Night Live, we now have a bit of an idea of what Mario Kart could look like if HBO got its hands on the IP. Spoiler: it&#x27;s pretty awesome.

The UK charts are in and the Switch&#x27;s big hitter for January — Fire Emblem Engage — has slipped out of the top ten. After taking number one on its debut week and dropping to seventh last week, the strategy RPG is now charting in 16th on the UK&#x27;s weekly boxed charts.
FIFA 23 is back on top after being pushed out of the number one slot two weeks ago. Last week&#x27;s number one, Dead Space, is now in third just behind God of War Ragnarok and ahead of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

                              <span>Jako každý měsíc je zde Virtuální Bastlírna s novinkami ze světa bastlení, elektroniky, vědy a techniky. Tento měsíc se navíc opravdu urodilo. Co si tedy bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili?

Ze světa software například zajímavá betaverze LTSpice 17.1, která umí počítat charakteristiku spínaných zdrojů z tranzientní simulace. Zároveň je tu první release candidate KiCADu 7 a brzy by měla být plnohodnotná verze 7. Nebo třeba aplikace, kterou můžete vyfotit klíč a jednoduše vytvořit výkres pro klíč, aby šel vyrobit duplikát. Vědci otestovali, jak pomocí sady ESP32 mapovat nejen počet osob v místnosti, ale i jak se zrovna pohybují a co dělají. ST Microelectronics má zase nový nástroj pro vývoj machine learning aplikací.

Novinky jsou ale i ze světa hardware. ST Microelectronics má nové řady procesorů C0 a U5. Renesas zase uvádí na trh řadu nových malých FPGA s předpokládanou cenou $0.5/kus. Česká společnost vyvíjející unikátní kryptočipy má už první vzorky pro testování.

I ze světa bastlení se však najdou novinky. Kupříkladu detekce chemických sloučenin pomocí odezvy na vysokofrekvenční pole, doporučení, jak dělat spolehlivě zapájitelné footprinty 0402 a 0201 součástek nebo jak se dělá plošný spoj, který se umí sám zapájet.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. února od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>What happened, Miss Williams?
It&#x27;s a good time to be a fan of fighting games and a good day for those who love their sexy silent assassins. Nina Willaims, star of Death by Degrees and also a Tekken mainstay, got her first solo trailer for the upcoming release of Tekken 8. Nina, sister of fellow fighter Anna Williams, sports an unforgettable look this time around, and I honestly can&#x27;t take my eyes off of her. The last Tekken game that I played was Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for the Wii U and she was definitely one of my most played characters. Given her history with the series, I don&#x27;t think there was ever a danger of Nina not appearing in Tekken 8, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to get her confirmed.

The reveal of Nina Williams for Tekken 8 follows previous trailers for the upcoming fighter that have confirmed other returning favorites. Other fighters set to appear in this highly anticipated sequel include:
Marshall Law
Paul Phoenix
King
Lars Alexandersson
Jin Kazama
Devil Jin
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
Jack-8
Nina&#x27;s trailer was just one of a few notable pieces of Tekken news today. To ready players for Tekken 8, Executive Director Katsuhiro Harada and Director Kohei Ikeda presented an in-depth look at some of the new systems that&#x27;ll be introduced in the game, including the new Rage System and a detailed look at the Heat System that was previously announced. The video, posted below, also confirms Tekken 8 will include an optional simplified control scheme that combines the Easy Combo and Assist features from Tekken 7. Bandai Namco also confirmed the Tekken World Tour 2023 would return this year with Tekken 7 and the entire tournament would be fully offline.

Tekken 8 is still without a set release date, but when the game does arrive, you&#x27;ll be able to pick it up for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.

Games and consoles have lasted for around five decades, and you know what has been with them all this time? Gaming accessories. Many of these devices, like motion controllers and link cables, opened up new gaming opportunities that weren&#x27;t available before. Others, like the Power Glove or the Sega Activator, were merely expensive novelties. But some of the best gaming accessories make memorable experiences for everyone, and here are 10 of them for you to consider.
10. Game Shark or Action Replay

And just like that, it&#x27;s February. Welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? friends, and you join me on the cusp of starting an actual &quot;week off&quot;, a system wherein you &quot;don&#x27;t go to work&quot; for a little bit, and it&#x27;s apparently &quot;fine&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine this working out at all, but I&#x27;m always willing to try trendy new ideas.
Of course, even when I&#x27;m off work, you can still find me right here this fine Saturday, joining you all for another round of well-wishes, work exorcism, and the welcoming of what I hope will be a brighter month for you, me, all of us. So, before I start sitting on my sofa, staring blankly at the walls, twiddling my thumbs, and hopefully not opening Slack, let&#x27;s get this week&#x27;s edition of Whatcha Been Playing underway.

It’s hard to believe that Backbone was a year and a half ago. My memories of it are suitably hazy outside some key scenes, but I remember the visual appeal, its interesting setting, and the fact that its narrative came so damned close to being satisfying and just falls slightly short. The important thing is I wanted more, so I was excited when Eggnut announced their next game would continue the series.
Tails: The Backbone Preludes is exactly that: a set of four short stories that flesh out Backbone’s characters. While it gives more context to what goes on in the narrative of Backbone, what I feel is more important about it is it’s another excuse to descend into the discomforting, roiling pot of pitch-noir narrative that the series is going for.

Following the delay of the RPG Atelier Ryza 3 last month, Koei Tecmo this weekend showcased the game&#x27;s opening cinematic at the Taipei Game Show. It&#x27;s at least something to entertain fans until the big launch.
Instead of arriving this month, Ryza 3 has now been pushed back to 24th March 2023. According to the game&#x27;s producer, the game needed some &quot;additional time to fine-tune&quot; but the team promises it will be &quot;even better&quot; when it does arrive.

Thank goodness January is over, hey? It always feels like it&#x27;s twice as long as it actually is, and it doesn&#x27;t help that it&#x27;s cold and a little quieter on the gaming front. So it&#x27;s time to dig deep and take a look back at last month for our monthly eShop Selects picks!
In New Year&#x27;s traditions, we&#x27;re breaking our resolution already and letting some of those interesting 7/10s sneak into the vote this time around. Other than Fire Emblem Engage, there weren&#x27;t too many headliners for the Switch, but there are plenty of little (and big) curios ready to download.

Having hit it out of the (water) park with its debut ABZÛ in 2016, Giant Squid landed The Pathless on PS5 just as the console launched in November 2020. The game provided the kind of audiovisual spectacle that would satisfy early adopters hankering after something to show off their next-gen kit, so you’d be forgiven for thinking a Switch port was entirely improbable. However, here we are, and Giant Squid, together with publisher Annapurna Interactive, has brought us yet another enormous open world squished lovingly onto a handheld screen.
The plot of The Pathless is not the most fantastically original, but provides just enough of a pretext to run really fast around a field doing cool stuff. In short, an evil force has overwhelmed a mystical land and your job, as the standard-issue saviour of everyone and everything, is to un-overwhelm it by firing arrows at huge cursed creatures. There’s a bit more to it, of course, but for all the snippets of text found on stone tablets or fallen NPCs in Breath-of-the-Wild-like remnants of battle, the story does feel rather contrived. The upshot of it all is that the creatures you must kill/save are each roaming their respective part of the world in the eye of a giant red fireball of a storm. To battle them, you must first collect magical tokens by solving puzzles around the region. These tokens can be used to unlock three towers, which will then enable you to start a hunt. Clearing the boss then grants access to the next region.

Hello folks, welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time, we perused over the three box art designs for Viewtiful Joe, one of the &#x27;Capcom Five&#x27; titles for the Nintendo GameCube. North America came out on top this time, winning 57% of the vote. Japan took the silver medal with 24%, and Europe closing out with the remaining 19%. It seems that the yellow/pink variants in Europe didn&#x27;t go down too well with voters, after all!

The GameCube might not have had much success in terms of sales, but it was actually home to quite a lot of amazing first-party titles. To this day, many of them are still essentially locked off on the same Nintendo platform. This includes games like Eternal Darkness, F-Zero GX, and even third-party hits such as Sega&#x27;s Phantasy Star Online.
If you have lost hope of the GameCube library returning to a Nintendo platform any time soon, there&#x27;s no need to worry - as there are other ways to relive the glory days of the stylish purple system. Video game developer and YouTuber Modern Vintage Gamer has recently taken a look at the &quot;massive update&quot; for Dolphin (Version 1.1.2) on the Xbox Series X|S - including the new front end while showing off series like Metroid Prime.

Josef Fares award-winning cooperative title It Takes Two has hit a sales milestone recently - with developer Hazelight Studios announcing it has now sold over 10 million copies around the world.
According to an official tweet from the company, that&#x27;s &quot;potentially twice as many players&quot; as it ever dreamed of playing the title thanks to the co-op. The Switch version arrived on the scene last November, so it presumably helped bolster sales numbers.

Remember a story we ran about some parents in the US who were trying to get their kids to sue Nintendo over &quot;Joy-Con drift&quot; in a class action lawsuit? Well, it seems the video game giant has come out on top.
In November last year, a federal judge ruled in favour of Nintendo in the &#x27;Sanchez et. al. v. Nintendo of America&#x27; case. Nintendo was able to prevent the case from going any further thanks to the Switch&#x27;s EULA (End User License Agreement) &quot;which disallows lawsuits&quot; and requires parties involved to enter a legal arbitration.

Square Enix released another update for its Switch-exclusive Chocobo GP. This is the first update of 2023, bumping the title up to Version 1.4.1. This patch contains multiple fixes, here&#x27;s the full rundown courtesy of the Square Enix support page:
Chocobo GP - Version 1.4.1 (1st Feb, 2023)

Thank you for playing “Chocobo GP”. The Ver.1.4.1 update for Chocobo GP is due for release on 2/1/2023.
*Please be aware that if the player is playing a game mode that involves online communications at the time the update is released, the system will quit out of that mode after the current race finishes and return to the title screen.
The content of this update is detailed below.
1. Fixes to an issue with multiplayer where settings would change from &quot;mirror&quot; mode to &quot;master&quot; mode if a lobby was created with mirror mode set and then play continued for a time without disbanding that lobby
2. Fixes to an issue on the Midgar short and technical courses, where racers would sometimes be judged to have gone off the course incorrectly.
3. Fixes to an issue when using Cactuar&#x27;s 1000 Needles ability in Time Attack mode where the ability is immediately forced to end if Cactuar touches a ghost while hit detection for the attack is active.
4. Fixes to an issue on the sticker select screen where the cursor moves to locations that should not be selectable if it is made to skip from a specific location.
5. Fixes to an issue on the LITE edition where options that cannot be selected are displayed as options that can be selected if transitioning between screens in a specific way.
6. Fixes to an issue where the correct colour is not shown when selecting the &quot;Premium Gold&quot; colour for the Kwackeys&#x27; speed type vehicle.
An internet connection is required to apply these updates.
We hope you continue to enjoy “Chocobo GP”.

A laundry list of demands aims to put that right.

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

With the recent news that Sons of the Forest will, after many delays, finally releasing later this month, (as an Early Access title rather than a finished product), players can rest assured that the content currently planned for inclusion in the initial release is only the beginning. The development team over at Endnight have referred to Sons of the Forest as:
&quot;the biggest most complex game we have ever made.&quot;

While there is a ton of content planned to roll out over time, as part of the new Early Access introduction, Endnight has been quick to clarify that the foundation has already been well established, and that the Early Access period is specifically intended as a means to incorporate community feedback in fine-tuning the game, and to allow them to cre…</span>

Remember that big old GeForce NOW leak from 2021? The one that supposedly revealed a list of in-development projects at various AAA studios? I&#x27;ve been thinking about that leak for just over a year now. More specifically, I&#x27;ve been thinking about one title on that list: a remake of Final Fantasy IX.
Recently, another, much less reputable rumor surfaced on 4chan (the thread has since been deleted, but its contents are cataloged on Reddit), suggesting that the Final Fantasy IX remake&#x27;s announcement is imminent. I&#x27;m not sure whether or not I believe that rumor, but it got me pondering the prospect of this FFIX remake again. Do we need a remake of Final Fantasy IX at this point?

A pretty special shmup release has joined the ranks of Hamster&#x27;s Arcade Archives this week, as Namco&#x27;s mythological and controversial blaster Phelios is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to the Japanese arcade market in 1989, before later being ported to the Sega Mega Drive, Phelios is a vertically-scrolling shmup that is (very loosely) patterned after Greek mythology. Players don the mighty armor of the sun god Apollo, who mounts his mighty steed Pegasus and embarks upon a mission to rescue his wife, Artemis, who has been abducted by the serpentine god, Typhon. Players guide Apollo through seven famously challenging stages, taking on notable boss characters such as Medusa, Antaeus, Cerberus, and The Sirens. Dusa would never.

Apple Arcade had something of a slow year in 2022. While there were still a handful of fun and time-consuming games released for the service, nothing came down the pipe that blew away my expectations or elevated itself above the best games available on the platform. I&#x27;m still playing a few games from last year — mostly just Cooking Mama: Cuisine! and Wylde Flowers — but at the turn of the new year, I was ready to finally say goodbye to the $5-a-month subscription once and for all.
Then, just three days into 2023, we learned Pokémon developer Game Freak would be releasing a new version of its niche classic Pocket Card Jockey on the service in January. Needless to say, I was excited, and I decided to table any cancellat…</span>

WWE 2K23 is laying the smackdown this March, and with all the excitement comes news about the roster for this year&#x27;s game. 2K has announced a ringful of WWE Superstars headed to WWE 2K23 through its marketing drive of in-game screenshots and trailers.
2K will let you have dream matches between modern and classic stars from WWE history. For example, you can have Roman Reigns take on Macho Man Randy Savage in his prime. The 2K Showcase will see John Cena face off once again against all of his career rivals. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem like his first major title opportunity, against JBL, might not be included, as Bradshaw is not currently listed on the roster. Fans are also expecting Bray Wyatt to arrive at some point in the future, perhaps through D…</span>

Online game closures are nothing new to the industry. New multiplayer and purely online games come and go with the seasons. But we&#x27;re a month into 2023, and have seen a heavy smattering of live-service games announcing their imminent closure.
Live-service, or &quot;games-as-a-service&quot; games, constantly update. They find life in the churn, and for some, it&#x27;s an extremely lucrative prospect. Look no further than Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, or Genshin Impact for examples. Heck, even MMOs — which existed a bit prior to the prominence of live-service titles — could fall under this umbrella. Games like Destiny 2 and Final Fantasy XIV are, and have been, going strong.
Still, this past week, we&#x27;ve seen a number of newer games announce their imminent closure. Fell…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario&#x27;s appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong&#x27;s reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
In this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser&#x27;s Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad&#x27;s wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario&#x27;s video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.
To this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7. For more, check out our reaction to the last full trailer during a recent episode of All Things Nintendo.</span>

                              <span>Thankfully not delayed for a long, long time
While The Last of Us has been making waves on HBO, PC players will have to wait a while to play the latest adaptation of the story. Naughty Dog is pushing the release date of The Last of Us Part I on PC back, from March 3 to March 28.
It&#x27;s only a few weeks, but the extra time will give the Naughty Dog crew a little extra time to work on the port. The developer says it&#x27;s noticed that players have been jumping back onto the story with the PS5 version of The Last of Us, and it wants to make sure the PC version puts a good foot forward.
&quot;And so we want to make sure that The Last of Us Part I PC debut is in the best shape possible. These additional few weeks will allow us to ensure this version of The Last of Us lives up to your, and our, standards. We are so excited to bring The Last of Us Part I to a new platform, reaching new and returning players with Joel and Ellie&#x27;s unforgettable story of survival, and we hope that you&#x27;ll continue to look forward to its PC release on March 28.&quot;

It&#x27;s not a long delay, but it does push the PC version a bit out from the finale of the HBO series. Episode 9, the last one for this season, airs on March 12. Now, rather than arriving just ahead of the finale, it&#x27;ll debut a few weeks after.

We are the last of us
Though Last of Us fans on PC might be waiting a little longer, it at least give them a bit of time to decompress from the HBO finale. Given how emotional the series has been thus far, folks might need a minute to recuperate.
The Last of Us Part I now hits PC on March 28, 2023.

                              <span>Okay, brain. Don’t accidentally write “First Blood.”
Vampires are pretty hot, but relationship options with them are limited. You know, because they’re fictional, which always gets in the way of good romance. However, First Bite is a visual novel that knows what we want: dates with vampires. This February 14th, we’re getting even more of that in First Bite: Bad Blood because if there’s one thing better than vampire dating, it’s more vampire dating. But there’s more than just one thing that’s better. Consider werewolf dating. Also, consider minotaur dating.
First Bite: Bad Blood picks up where the base game left off, serving as a sequel that again follows Noe, a freshly-chomped vampire who is adjusting to being a cold-blooded dead person. But I’m going to have to quote the developer directly on this one, because I’m not sure I can really put it better myself: “things aren’t quite as simple as you hoped when you’re being eased into vampire life by a murder-himbo obsessed with Eurodance, a narcissist with an online shopping addiction, and a wild card with a penchant for BDSM.” Sounds magma-hot.

This time around, just to make things spicier, you’re going up against the most arousing force in the universe: bureaucracy. A missed email is all it takes to put your destiny in question, as the vampire council is a bit miffed about being snubbed. Wow, I can hardly contain the lust boiling atop that overwhelmingly erotic plot summary.
Sarcasm aside, First Bite is an LGBTQ+ friendly visual novel with a dark comedy approach. I’ve been going through a bit of a dry spell when it comes to my digital romances, so I might just have to sink my teeth into this one.
First Bite is available right now on Steam and itch.io, its DLC, First Bite: Bad Blood will hit Steam on February 14, 2023, and can be pre-purchased on itch.io for $4.99.

Being someone who never really stopped playing games after they reached their expiry date, I spend a lot of time thinking about the flow and evolution of game design. Why, after some successful genres reach a certain age, did the industry just collectively seem to move on? As with any art form, trends constantly emerge in the medium of video games. As is also common, we eventually circle back to the ones we fondly remember, and video games seem to be the most literal when it comes to that. It wasn’t enough for the side-scroller to reach a resurgence; the pixel-prominent visuals had to come with it.
Yet, we also live in an age where we are protective of our art. The internet has ensured that you can obscure, but you can’t destroy. If I’m ever in the mood for Roller Coaster Tyc…</span>

                              <span>The publisher is paying up to close out the SEC probe
Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay $35 million to settle charges from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These charges included allegations that it failed to maintain proper workplace disclosure procedures, and violated an SEC whistleblower protection rule.
The SEC investigated into Activision Blizzard, charging that it did not have proper procedures for documenting workplace misconduct complaints. Because of this, it would not be able to adequately disclose whether misconduct problems merited disclosure to shareholders. Additionally, the SEC charged that Activision Blizzard was found in violation of a whistleblower protection rule.

                              <span>Yo, She-bitch... Let&#x27;s go.
Saber Interactive has launched a brand new mode for its cartoonishly gory multiplayer title Evil Dead: The Game — The new &quot;Splatter Royale&quot; mode is now available to download on PC and console platforms, free of charge, and offers up a fresh/rotten new take on the battle royale genre.
In Splatter Royale, up to 40 players step into the viscera-soaked world of The Evil Dead, donning the gross, splatteriffic visage of any of the roster&#x27;s demons, or, alternately, a Deadtite-turned variant of Evil Dead&#x27;s many heroes. Once you&#x27;ve selected your death dealer, then it&#x27;s off into the woods, to fight it out in an every-demon-for-themselves competition for gory glory.

                              <span>Running out of GAAS
If you’re keeping score on games going offline, you can add another tally mark. Smilegate Entertainment has announced that military shooter CrossfireX will be shutting down on May 18, 2023. This adds to a growing list of games-as-a-service titles that are being given the axe.
What makes CrossfireX a bit unique in this regard, however, is that it has a single-player component developed by Remedy Entertainment. And despite that this is something that should not require an internet connection, once the servers go quiet, the campaign will be inaccessible, according to an FAQ from the developers. Note that the single-player wasn’t free, but apparently, the price paid wasn’t enough to ensure any effort would be made to divest it from the servers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;X7yGkRV8Bl8
Whenever a game is announced as “always online,” there tends to be a bit of nose-gazing where it’s suggested that it’s perfectly okay in the modern age of fridges connected to the internet. Well, where’s your God now? Maybe CrossfireX wasn’t the most whiz-bang revolutionary game, but this sort of thing could happen to any game that requires an internet connection for whatever reason. This includes some internet-dependent DRM solutions like Denuvo.
To add more poop to the pot, while CrossfireX is free-to-play in regards to multiplayer, it was supported by in-app purchases. Smilegate will refund all of these purchases… so long as they were made fourteen days prior to this announcement. I guess there needs to be a cutoff date, since even ephemeral experiences have a price tag, but considering this announcement comes less than a year after the CrossfireX’s release, it might be hard to swallow for some.
So, that’s your four-minute warning. Crossfire X is currently available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, but it won’t be after May 18.

It&#x27;s the end of another week, and that means Epic Games Store is ready to reveal the next game it will be offering up to all of its users free of charge — And its a matter of fires, fights, and fricassees, with the arrival of kitchen and restaurant management sim Recipe for Disaster, available from February 9.
Developed by the fantastically monikered Spanish outfit Dapper Penguin, and launched on PC in the summer of 2022, Recipe for Disaster tasks players with the smooth operation of a professional kitchen and its attached dining room, ensuring the quick, efficient, and accurate work of its chefs and waiting staff, delivering high-quality meals to customers while keeping everybody happy and safe — the former being something of an impossibility in the catering industry.
Yes, Chef.

Recipe for Disaster offers up customization and management goals on a huge variety of kitchen elements, from ensuring stock of quality ingredients, to purchasing top-tier equipment, and managing the distinct personalities of your staff to encourage team synergy and discourage inter-culinary brawling. You can also design the restaurant itself, and even conjure up your own recipes to really put your eatery on the map. Dapper Penguin&#x27;s release was well-received by critics on release, and is well worth a look for management sim fans or anyone who believes they&#x27;re cut out for the non-stop, high-pressure world of foods and feuds.
Recipe For Disaster will be available to download, free of charge, from Epic Games Store from February 9-16. Until then, users still have the opportunity to bag themselves this week&#x27;s freebies, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider and City of Gangsters.

                              <span>The studio is moving on to the next big thing
Turtle Rock Studios is looking ahead towards its next project. And because of that, it&#x27;ll be leaving Back 4 Blood as it is, right now.
In a short update, Turtle Rock Studios confirms it&#x27;s not working on any more Back 4 Blood content. Mostly, it&#x27;s because the studio is working on its next game.
&quot;Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.&quot;

This doesn&#x27;t mean the game is shutting down, though. Back 4 Blood will stay online, and available on both Xbox Game Pass and the PlayStation Plus extra tiers. The developers also say they will continue hanging around in places the community congregates, like the subreddit and Discord, to keep interacting. The team may be &quot;quieter in the short term,&quot; but promises to be back.

Don&#x27;t look Back in anger
Back 4 Blood hit back in October 2021, as a continuation of Turtle Rock&#x27;s legacy of co-op zombie FPS development. As the name suggests, it follows in the footsteps of Turtle Rock&#x27;s work on Left 4 Dead. And though it didn&#x27;t mark the same historic highs, I did enjoy my time with the new deckbuilding ideas and characters that Turtle Rock created for Back 4 Blood.
The Turtle Rock crew rolled out a pretty decent amount of expansions for Back 4 Blood, and now it gets to move on to something new. At the very least, it&#x27;s a neat and clean conclusion, and it&#x27;s staying online. Considering how many online game closures we&#x27;ve seen in the last week alone, that&#x27;s a good win for the Cleaners who want to keep running these levels.

One of my favorite diplomatic encounters in a game comes from the tabletop adventure Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon.
After a long night of questing, my brother and I just wanted our current chapter to end. However, as we passed through a city, we triggered an encounter with a lost child. In Tainted Grail, diplomacy is treated equal to combat. You’re given a unique deck of cards to resolve these encounters, and the intended solution involved using empathy-based cards to calm the child and find a caretaker for them. However, we decided on a different strategy.
My brother’s burly blacksmith had two cards in his hand called &quot;Sinister Voice&quot;. Due to some funny mechanics, these cards could resolve both phases of this encounter single-handedly despite scaling off h…</span>

                              <span>I hope they fix their AAA pre-order system within our lifetime
Nintendo is still proceeding as planned with its updated storefront, which includes an incorporation of the My Nintendo program amid their pre-order system, and other merch. While communication on all of this is generally spotty; the UK and Ireland side has, at the very least, opened up a Twitter account to give folks some general updates.
It went live just hours ago, and asks users to &quot;follow the channel to stay up to date about all things My Nintendo Store.&quot; The first order of business is setting things straight with Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon SteelBook situation, which is now a pre-order bonus for the March 17 release (in that region). All current pre-orders will be upgraded automatically.
For context, pre-order bonuses for Nintendo games are often messy, resulting in lengthy queues, system issues, or very brief sale periods. Things really came to a head with the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 situation, where that mess spilled over to multiple regions. Hopefully this Twitter account can at least ease some of the communication problems Nintendo has been having with high-ticket pre-orders.
If you&#x27;re in the UK or Ireland and actually care about this stuff, consider giving it a follow!

The newest Tera Raid Spotlight event is live in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, and this one deserves your attention. From February 3rd to February 5th, Armarouge and Ceruledge will appear more frequently as Blue Star Tera Raids. These can appear as either 4-Star or 5-Star encounters and will sport any Tera Type in the game. Unlike past raid challenges, it appears there are no preferred Tera Types that will appear over others.
As is usual for these spotlight events, these encounters shouldn’t be any sweat for experienced raiders. Anyone who has taken down Greninja has the tools to make short work of these two monsters. That said, newer players who are still advancing through the main story and postgame content may have some trouble taking these f…</span>

                              <span>Updates 1.03 and 1.04
I haven&#x27;t really been having much trouble with Dead Space on PS5 (outside of a few times I had to reload checkpoints); but folks have reported issues with stuttering on several platforms, as well as out-there problems like Twitch streaming bugs or various PC graphical anomalies. While the development team is tracking all known issues here, the recent 1.03 patch addresses some problems on PC and PS5 (with Xbox arriving later this week).
EA has been fairly vague with what patch 1.03 fixes exactly, but suffice to say many players have been responding positively to it. This is especially the case on PC, where the option to disable VRS alone has helped the stability of that platform tremendously. Update 1.04 also addresses similar issues.
Full Dead Space 1.03 patch notes
Disabling VRS is now possible on PC
Addressed PS5 stuttering
Addressed the black screen bug
General stability and performance fixes
Full Dead Space 1.04 patch notes (Source: Update Crazy)
Added performance improvements.
Addressed UI issues.
Addressed various stuttering and lag issues.
Added general stability fixes.
Other minor fixes.
A Dead Space Reddit community member has also provided a workaround for PC stuttering issues, if you&#x27;re still having them:
Making sure power profile is set to AMD Performance Mode (it stutters on AMD Balanced)
Disabling Exploit Protection in Windows for &quot;Dead Space.exe&quot; (need to add exception)This is very common resolution of stuttering in DX12 games, Horizon Zero Dawn had the same problem.
Disable GPU scheduling (I&#x27;ve checked that during game GPU load is ~90% while CPU is ~60%, so I guess it&#x27;s fine to do scheduling on CPU)
Disabling Adobe Creative Cloud

A new report suggests that Xbox subsidiary The Coalition may have canned the production of two unannounced titles in order to begin work on the sixth mainline entry into the dystopian shooter series, Gears of War.
Speaking on the Game Mess Mornings show, Giant Bomb writer and frequent spoiler Jeff Grubb suggests that the studio had been working on multiple projects, including the aforementioned two new titles, additional support for Halo Infinite, while also helping Epic Games with its Unreal 5 tech demo The Matrix Awakens. Grubb suggests that the team may have been pulled from all of the above projects to start working on Gears 6 — a continuation of the popular and hugely successful Xbox series.
https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;8HHmV4uZcmpzHgcaWvhOBw
&quot;This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit. The studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but definitely, that will be their next game.&quot;
The most recent mainline entry in the Gears series, Gears 5, launched on PC and Xbox One in 2019, and follows the story of former rebel outlier Kait Diaz, as she attempts to stem the flow of the Horde hivemind and uncover the roots of her own connection to the subterranean species. The sequel was praised for its impactful and visceral action, as well as offering another intriguing and dramatic chapter to the ongoing Gears of War narrative.
While there has been no official word from The Coalition, it is common belief that the studio was expected to continue the Gears franchise at some point on Gen-9 hardware. Even if Grubb&#x27;s sources are correct, it is unlikely that we&#x27;ll be seeing Gears 6 rev its chainsaw bayonet anytime in the immediate future.

                              <span>Since the remake of Resident Evil 4 graces Game Informer’s cover this month, we thought it’d be fitting to revisit the game that kicked off Capcom’s remake craze: Resident Evil 2. 
Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.

                              <span>The PC launch of The Last of Us Part I has been delayed by a few weeks. Instead of releasing on March 3, the game now arrives on March 28.
Naughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
The Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far. The show’s second season has already been confirmed.

That free-to-play launch happened last June with the start of Season 6 and now, Velan has announced that it will shut the game down in June of this year. More specifically, Knockout City will be shutdown on June 6.

Yout seeks a declaration that it doesn&#x27;t violate the DMCA and accuses the music industry group of defamation and business disparagement.

                              <span>When Duke Nukem 3D burst onto the FPS scene in the Nineties, young CJ was a bit confused. This Duke wasn&#x27;t the purple-shirted acrobat I&#x27;d known from Apogee Software&#x27;s pair of platformers earlier that decade. He was brash, crude, and and didn&#x27;t side-scroll anymore. It wasn&#x27;t for me, so I moved on to other games. I still occasionally loaded up those earlier platformers though, wistfully remembering a time when Duke presumably used actual toilets when he needed to answer a call of nature.

                              <span>Gather round, children, and I’ll tell you of something magical: the NZXT Source 340 compact mid-tower PC case with side window, product code CA-S340W-B1. Good gravy, did I love that case. Tightly proportioned without being too cramped for a full-size graphics card, maturely designed without looking dull, and hewn from some of most gorgeously textured matte steel I’ve seen on a piece of computing hardware. Don’t even get me started on the upgraded Source 340 Elite. It’s been years since these cases disappeared from sale and ascended to Component Heaven, and although it’s taken a few tries, there’s finally a new chassis that’s worthy of the legacy: the NZXT H5 Flow.

                              <span>Hello folks. Earlier this week, we unveiled some of the cool things coming up for RPS this year - many of which revolve around you, our lovely readers and supporters. If you haven&#x27;t had a chance to check that post out yet, I&#x27;d love to hear what you think of it. And yes, fixing our comments nesting is still very much on the agenda as well. Our tech team have a lot of websites to take care of these days, and they&#x27;re working as fast as they can to sort things out. As soon as I have an update I can share, I&#x27;ll let you know. 
But enough about techy bits. I wanted to use this Letter From The Editor to talk about some of the more supporter-oriented things mentioned in that &#x27;What&#x27;s coming up&#x27; post. Specifically, I want to kick off the inaugural Ask RPS - your chance to ask us, the editorial team, questions about games, the site, the way we do things, and other things we like.

Navarro’s series Midnight Scenes has been the highlight, having disturbing premises and Twilight Zone creepiness. The newest episode, Midnight Scenes: From The Woods is due on February 9th and it looks as chilling as ever.

                              <span>I really do not play enough visual novels these days. Raptor Boyfriend has been sat on my hard drive for at least a year, and it won&#x27;t be the last. Historically, I have fallen hard for two kinds of VN: emotionally probing character dramas like Eliza and Watch Me Jump, or gentle and slightly silly comedies like Laura Silver and Camp W. The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone&#x27;s-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.

Raptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.

Then, during my first week back at work, vid bud Liam told me to try Age Of Empires II. Never before has a New Year’s Resolution been abandoned so fast. I really wanted to stick with it. Promise.
But! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II&#x27;s low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s third season is right around the corner and, as always, that means we’re getting a new map. Blizzard have treated us to our first look at the Antarctic Peninsula, an icy-themed control map launching alongside Season 3 on February 7th. The Antarctic Peninsula is a big deal since it’ll delve into Mei’s backstory, it’s the first natural environment in an OW map, and it lets you fish. As in catching fish. At an ice hole. As in, you can catch fish at an ice hole in Overwatch 2.

                              <span>The last few weeks have been messy for The Day Before, the survival MMO that was Steam’s most wishlisted game for much of 2022. Last month, The Day Before’s Steam page was quietly removed from the storefront following a trademark dispute. Developer Fntastic also delayed the game from March 1st to November 10th at the same time, just days before they promised to show some raw gameplay footage of it in action. The whole debacle led to accusations on Reddit and Discord that the game didn’t even exist, but at long last, that promised gameplay video has arrived. And... it’s merely fine.

It&#x27;s also getting a Steam Next Fest demo next week on February 6th, which gives you access to its chunky tutorial and the early portion of its campaign, plus the Historic Battle of The Battle Of Passchendaele, which is the mission I got a chance to play at the end of last year. As it turns out, I&#x27;ve also had a sneak peek at the Next Fest build, too, and there&#x27;s a heck of a lot to sink your teeth into. Here&#x27;s a small glimpse of what to expect.

                              <span>Fishing mini-games make just about any game better. There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk. The indie game Dredge subverts what I like about fishing games, with an eerie eldritch horror waiting beneath the ocean’s surface. We won’t need to wait long before we see what&#x27;s under there as Dredge releases on March 30th.

I gave the patch a whirl to try out its PC-specific changes – namely a new &#x27;Performance&#x27; setting for RT global illumination and a fix for the broken screen space reflections setting – only to find that non-ray-traced, DirectX 12 performance has been utterly knackered.

                              <span>I tend to find that a lot of rhythm games hold back from going completely beast mode. It definitely comes from a place of accessibility, where an onslaught of timed bars and coloured symbols can be intimidating for casual players. But what about the rest of us who want to be pummelled to death in time with a catchy beat?
Good news! TinyBuild&#x27;s new action-adventure game Rhythm Sprout: Sick Beats &amp; Bad Sweets does not hold back. I&#x27;m not even halfway through the game and I’ve had my butt completely kicked by its barrage of oncoming beats, and all in perfect time to its soda-pop EDM.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 processors offer incredible gaming and content creation performance, though high prices have stifled their adoption. Now, these CPUs - and their accompanying motherboards and RAM - are starting to become more affordable, with the high-end Ryzen 7 7700X dropping from a launch price of £440 to just £312 at Amazon UK as of today.

Normally this monitor costs north of £300, but today it&#x27;s down to £279 at Dell UK, a great price that can be dropped further to £251 if you have a student or Dell Advantage employee account.

It&#x27;s good news then that Deep Rock Galactic is celebrating its fifth anniversary by making it possible to play it exactly as it was at release in early 2018.

Of course, that&#x27;s just one way they&#x27;re celebrating the milestone, alongside an anniversary event and new DLC.

The best thing about it, as is so often the case with 4X and grand strategy games, is the very beginning. That opening half-hour of limitless potential and giddy curiosity is utterly spellbinding. I don&#x27;t know if any strategy game does it better.

                              <span>Now that The Sims 4 has babies and toddlers, the family unit is complete. Perfect timing too, as the game’s next expansion is all about growing up with family. The Sim 4’s Growing Together Expansion Pack is out March 16th and it’s planning to expand the way your Sims change over time and relate to other Sims

                              <span>Can I tell you a secret? I&#x27;m terrible at Battle Brothers. I&#x27;m still terrible at Battle Brothers, even after playing it on and off for a few years. It&#x27;s a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it&#x27;s all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.
But since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it&#x27;s about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It&#x27;s long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That&#x27;s partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow &quot;do and be everything&quot; approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.

                              <span>Capcom’s monstrously big Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is receiving its fourth free title update on February 7th. Sunbreak’s latest update adds new Event Quests, Anomaly Research content, paid DLC, and two new Elder Dragons to hunt. I don’t think any of these additions are as exciting as the giant Sweetcorn weapon introduced last year, but I digress.

We ran out of themes, so we&#x27;re going to flip to a magazine-ish show, where we discuss some current events as well as the games we&#x27;ve been playing. This week we talk about games on film, with everyone bloody loving The Last Of Us TV show and reports that Lara Croft will be hitting the small screen too. We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real. Plus: &quot;try cutting off their limbs&quot;; what is Forspoken, and why so graphics?

                              <span>Little fluffy stuffed friends exert a strange and unknowable power over me. These days we only occasionally get offered free stuff as part of our jobs, because we are not YouTubers or Twitch streamers. When I first started websites would get sent a lot of stuff -  you know, statuettes and toys and doodads. I don&#x27;t like these things, and I always wished PRs sent me cake instead. Neither thing would make me like the game more, but at least I can eat cake, and the same cannot be said for a figurine of some kind of big-titted space samurai holding a sword.
I have, however, discovered that plushies of game characters I like are an exception to this.

                              <span>With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN&#x27;s Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn&#x27;t all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon&#x27;s Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn&#x27;t actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. 

This time, though, you&#x27;re right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home?

Spirited Thief allows you to play out that fantasy in a series of top-down, turn-based, stealthy heists. Better yet, it’s sneaking onto PC this summer and has a demo available now.

It&#x27;s called Stereogram, because it&#x27;s made of moving stereograms. Let your eyes go slack and gaze into the distance of an optical illusion as you jump around pretty little Magic Eye levels in this platformer which reminds me of VVVVVV.

                              <span>Delete After Reading is a delightful looking text-based puzzler that will be familiar to anyone who’s played Simogo’s excellent (albeit sadly iOS-only game) Device 6, only with fewer spooks this time. Like Simogo&#x27;s surreal thriller, most of Delete After Reading plays out like you&#x27;re reading a novel, where scrolling through paragraphs of text will reveal images, clues and puzzles you can interact with. As the devs put it, Delete After Reading is a “game you can read, and a book you can play,” and looks and sounds really quite rad. Even better, it’s releasing on March 14th.

                              <span>Okay, we all agree that the ocean is kind screwed up right? Like, we’ve all seen that YouTube video showing how deep the sea is and unanimously agree that it’s, like, terrifying? As much as I love relaxing subaquatic city builders and exploring underwater alien worlds, I want games about stuff in the sea that makes my skin crawl to think about. Enter Full Fathom.
So, Full Fathom isn’t out yet, or even has an official release date, but I just love the idea and look of this game. Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.

                              <span>Last night was a restless one for the Steam Deck. In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. 
Ubi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks.

                              <span>Fans have been clamouring for a sequel to Titanfall 2 since its release in 2016, but it looks like we might need to put those hopes on hold for a little longer. According to a report from Bloomberg, EA have cancelled an unannounced project codenamed Titanfall Legends, a single-player mash-up between Titanfall and Apex Legends - Respawn’s battle royale, set in the same universe. Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week. EA are reportedly trying to find other positions for the devs, but those that aren&#x27;t rehired are being laid off with severance.

                              <span>Sometimes I want to describe games in the most high-brow way possible. I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.
Hi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. 
Hi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum.

You&#x27;ll learn about scrapped redesigns for the iconic chainsaw villager, how normalcy breeds horror, and how Nakaoka and the team created a new cow-headed, hammer-wielding villager referred to as The Brute.

She’s been kidnapped by a mysterious cult and held captive in a rural Spanish village players must search and survive in. Once you find Ashley, you become both her protector and, sometimes, partner. Her mechanics and interactions with Leon have some big changes, so as part of our larger cover story, I asked directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi to explain their reasons for making them. 
By clicking the right analog stick, Leon can tell Ashley to keep close (yelling &quot;come on!&quot;) or to maintain some distance (&quot;spread out&quot;).

WWE 2K22 relaunched the franchise on the right foot, and 2K23 aims to build upon that success. The improvements and additions from last year’s game remain intact and expanded in some cases. The legendary John Cena gives his blessing of sorts by gracing the game&#x27;s cover and starring in the centerpiece Showcase mode. That’s all well and good, but the addition of the long-requested WarGames match may be 2K23’s most exciting bullet point.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly canceled a single-player game set in the shared Apex Legends and Titanfall universe. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the matter say EA canceled the project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, that was in development at Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment. Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. 


The publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. 
It&#x27;s likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.&quot;
Word of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter&#x27;s developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn&#x27;s upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. 
The company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It&#x27;s important to note this isn&#x27;t a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it&#x27;s likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. 
PlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console&#x27;s big holiday release. 


Including both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. 
PlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2&#x27;s 45.4 million but down from Q1&#x27;s 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5&#x27;s lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.
In terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That&#x27;s up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. 
All told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5&#x27;s best quarter yet.

Čtvrtletní odměny, roční odměny, snížení dorovnání příspěvku na penzijní připojištění na polovinu z 5 % na 2,5 %, pozastavení zvyšování platů a snížení základních platů – to vše podle interní komunikace probíhá.</span>

                              <span>Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. 
In an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn&#x27;t provide a reason for why it&#x27;s closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox&#x27;s Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: 
Batman: Arkham Knight
Battlefield 1
Bloodborne
Call of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy
Days Gone
Detroit: Become Human
Fallout 4
Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition
God of War (2018)
Infamous: Second Son
The Last Guardian
The Last of Us Remastered
Monster Hunter: World
Mortal Kombat X
Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)
Resident Evil VII: Biohazard
Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End
Until Dawn
Last year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven&#x27;t already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.</span>

Hi-Fi Rush occupies an increasingly rare space in the big-budget video game industry: that of colorful, goofy, and light-hearted titles. For its 10 or 11-hour runtime, it has more in common with a Saturday morning cartoon than a thin attempt at gritty, prestige television, like most triple-A games these days, and that&#x27;s easily its biggest strength. That its gameplay and combat are a unique melding of rhythm and stylish action games is merely the cherry on top.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, the next installment in the psychological survival horror franchise, arrives on May 16 instead of its original March window. 
The Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.


You can check out Amnesia: The Bunker on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

Elsewhere in today&#x27;s announcement, PlayStation announced that the PlayStation Plus Collection, which PS5 owners subscribed to Plus have had access to since 2020, will no longer be offered starting May 9.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is finally out next week, after multiple delays that pushed it out of its original 2021 release date to 2023. And you can prepare the game&#x27;s release with a new gameplay launch trailer released by developer Avalanche Software today. 
The trailer features roughly two and a half minutes of new Hogwarts Legacy footage, including a mix of both cinematics from the game and gameplay. We see Hogsmeade, professors, students, and plenty of Hogwarts, of course. 
Check it out for yourself in the Hogwarts Legacy launch trailer below: 


&quot;Hogwarts Legacy invites players to embark on an epic journey as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts, gifted with a rare ability to tap into ancient, powerful magic,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Guided by the Wizard&#x27;s Field Guide and unique instruction from professors and other characters, fans will uncover a compelling storyline filled with thrilling challenges and mysteries.&quot;
For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month ,and then watch this cinematic tour of the Hogwarts castle grounds. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that.
Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game), and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4. The Switch version of the game will be released on July 25.</span>

                              <span>Valiant Hearts: Coming Home, the sequel to 2014&#x27;s Valiant Hearts: The Great War, is now available to play for all Netflix members. 
This Netflix-exclusive game can be played by any subscriber on iOS and Android devices. The sequel brings players back to World War I &quot;for a dramatic narrative game following four interweaving stories of friendship, survival, and sacrifice amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war.&quot; Valiant Hearts: The Great War was a surprise hit back in 2014, garnering attention and storytelling praise from critics and players alike. 
Check out the Valiant Hearts: Coming Home release trailer below: 


&quot;James joins the Harlem Hellfighters to search for his heroic older brother Freddie, while Anna tends to the wounded and broken,&quot; a press release about the game reads. &quot;Ernst, a German driver, and George, a British aviator, each face their own challenges, and Walt, the canine companion from the first game, is back to aid players in their progress through exploration, puzzle-solving, and action sequences.&quot; 
Ubisoft says original core members that worked on Valiant Hearts: The Great War at Ubisoft Montepllier in 2014 have returned to develop Valiant Hearts: Coming Home in collaboration with Old Skull Games.
This is the first of three Ubisoft mobile games coming to Netflix. The next game is Mighty Quest, which is also due out this year and will bring Netflix subscribers a &quot;roguelite-inspired hack-and-slash adventure.&quot; The third game will be an Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile game to coincide with Netflix&#x27;s live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

                              <span>Electronic Arts is ending development on both Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile. It is shuttering Battlefield Mobile developer Industrial Toys as well. 
This news was part of EA&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2023 Q3 financial results released yesterday, in which the company revealed that it is also delaying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to April.
EA says it is ending Battlefield Mobile, which hadn&#x27;t been fully released yet (although many had played through betas), as part of a &quot;pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players.&quot; The company adds that it is hard at work evolving Battlefield 2042, which launched to disappointment from fans, and in &quot;pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe.&quot; 
As for Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the game&#x27;s strong start, &quot;the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations&quot; of its players. 
&quot;At Respawn, we aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding,&quot; a statement from Respawn reads. &quot;Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence. It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.&quot; 
All real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game&#x27;s shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game. EA says it will not be providing refunds for money spent on Apex Legends Mobile in its FAQ, which answers other questions you might have here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running out of pictures to use when I write about Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams because I&#x27;ve only completed two puzzles in it. I&#x27;ve been doing the third one for about a year, because it&#x27;s, I think, six thousand pieces. I say &quot;i think&quot; because it&#x27;s been long enough that I can&#x27;t remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it&#x27;s a lot of thousand.
I really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they&#x27;re quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.

                              <span>Revisiting Minecraft to discuss whether it deserved the GOTY award back in 2010 is a hard task, in the same way that discussing the importance of sliced bread is hard. It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.
In fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft. If everyone brings one thing, we can have a show-and-tell.

                              <span>Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there&#x27;s some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone.

                              <span>I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.
Pentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati&#x27;s vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati&#x27;s humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.

                              <span>As someone who considers Uniqlo an extravagance, the HTC Vive XR Elite might just be the most expensive thing I’ll ever wear. Revealed at CES 2023 and set for launch in March, this is the first Vive VR headset in years with real PC gaming credentials, while borrowing from the more compact design of the mobile VR-minded Vive Flow VR glasses. I recently went to try them out over here in London, with an uneasy thought in my mind: even with a lighter design than the Vive Cosmos series, how could this possibly be worth £1299 / $1099?

                              <span>For Hayden and I&#x27;s Ultimate Audio Bang podcast, we thought we&#x27;d do something a little differently this year. Instead of focusing on one theme and yapping on about it for a very long time, we&#x27;re now splitting the pod into two segments: the first half on the hip and happening, the second on an FPS genre or subgenre that we&#x27;re unfamiliar with. Our first port of call? theHunter: Call Of The Wild.
In our first sessions with the game, we both concluded that A) deer are incredibly athletic; and B) we&#x27;re the most impatient people, perhaps ever. More than that, though, we hadn&#x27;t realised how important it was to fixate on your prey. Not like, track them down. But like, track them down, you know?

                              <span>A Bloomberg report from yesterday has revealed new details on the state of the Halo franchise and the turmoil at developer 343 Industries. This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days&#x27; notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development.

                              <span>Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.
“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”


When the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release.

Live services will go offline on February 28th at 4PM GMT/10AM CST/11AM ET. In a blog post from the team, Iron Galaxy shared that Season Two will be Rumbleverse’s last, but it should be receiving one final update soon to remove the game&#x27;s monetisation. This continues the trend of me discovering a new battle royale game, thanks to the announcement of its death.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played Shiny Shoe&#x27;s upcoming roguelike Inkbound once before, and not only is it markedly different to their previous game Monster Train, but it also featured the snappiest turn-based combat I&#x27;d seen. With that in mind, I dove into the game&#x27;s recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn&#x27;t come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.

In a series of Twitter posts, Activision announced a new, free-to-play “small map” called Ashika Island. Warzone’s new map will feature a brand new mode DMZ, alongside the returning mode Resurgence - a slimmer BR that cuts the lobby size down from 150 to 50 players, and enables respawns. Ashika Island and the new modes will launch alongside Season 02 on February 15th.

                              <span>Tvůrce ChatGPT, společnost OpenAI, zveřejnila webový nástroj pro odhalování textů napsaných strojem. Má pomoci nejen učitelům zjistit, zda je daný text dílem člověka či umělé inteligence. OpenAI upozorňuje na to, že nástroj zatím není dokonalý a výsledky jeho zpracování závisejí mimo jiné na tom, zda je zkoumaný text podobný materiálům, na kterých byla analýza trénována. Může docházet k falešným pozitivitám i negativitám, takže by nemělo jít o jediný zdroj, dle kterého bude zkoumaný text posuzován.</span>

The latest update also offered news on Project Rene, the eventual successor to The Sims 4. The key takeaways: it&#x27;s not an MMO but it will have multiplayer as well as singleplayer, and it&#x27;s years away from release.

                              <span>Marvel Snap is several rare things at once: a licensed superhero game that&#x27;s fun; a card game that&#x27;s graspable and allows for casual play; and a free-to-play game that doesn&#x27;t feel warped by microtransations.

As of today, it now has a PvP battle mode to enable friends to pit their decks against one another. It&#x27;s either making a good thing better, or it&#x27;s the beginning of the end of all the things I mentioned above.

                              <span>Portable SSDs are jolly useful for quickly transferring large files, like Steam game file backups or 4K videos, from device to device. I&#x27;ve said before in similar blogs that I use one to ferry videos from my computer downstairs to my TV, but I also rely on one to quickly set up a PC for performance testing and copy game files to my Steam Deck. 
In any case, you&#x27;d normally expect to pay anywhere from £70 to £100 for a 1TB drive of a decent spec, but today you can pick up Integral&#x27;s 1TB USB-C Portable SSD for £59.99 at MyMemory. To get this price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HMMJSU at the checkout.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s WH-1000XM line of noise-cancelling headphones is brilliant - I&#x27;ve used a pair of XM4s while working for years - and they&#x27;re actually pretty decent for PC gaming too, especially if you&#x27;re in a louder environment. That&#x27;s why I thought I should tell you that these WH-1000XM5s are discounted to £249 on Sony&#x27;s UK site when you use code UPGRADE50 to knock £50 off the price. This is the first time they&#x27;ve dropped to this level, and for a go-anywhere set of headphones they might just be worth a look.

                              <span>Dead Space’s remake treatment has produced a piece of gory greatness, some Steam Deck wobbles notwithstanding. Vid bud Liam touched on the visual upgrades in his review, but since it’s been shaking my bones even harder than the original did, I wanted to dive even deeper into the mottled flesh of the modernised Dead Space to examine how all those new polygons and effects aren’t just there to please nerds. They do, in fact, make the remake scarier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There&#x27;s the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she&#x27;s the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she&#x27;s more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there&#x27;s the youngest, who&#x27;s extremely likeable, in large part because she&#x27;s learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she&#x27;s modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn&#x27;t really forged her own identity.
Then there&#x27;s Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he&#x27;s just a bit gawky. He&#x27;s experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it&#x27;s only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

                              <span>Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It&#x27;s the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s &quot;words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,&quot; and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

                              <span>The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We&#x27;ve been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

                              <span>Whomst among us hasn&#x27;t dreamt of somehow being transported to a magical world, where there are talking unicorns, and you can throw lightning and control plants because you are this universe&#x27;s very special hero? Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I&#x27;d be a bit disappointed. It&#x27;s all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn&#x27;t much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it&#x27;s over; I didn&#x27;t pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I&#x27;d be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn&#x27;t happen much, and isn&#x27;t contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you&#x27;ve seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

                              <span>A series of senior job listings have revealed some details about The Molasses Flood’s upcoming Witcher game, codenamed Project Sirius. The studio behind Flame In The Flood were acquired by CD Projekt Red back in 2021, and CDPR first mentioned Sirius in an investor call last October. The project was initially described as &quot;an innovative take on The Witcher universe telling an unforgettable story.” We now know that this “unforgettable story” could potentially be told inside of a multiplayer game, or at least a game with multiplayer and social elements.

You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

However, Goodporn turned the tables by claiming that it owns the rights to its content, citing a previously signed agreement that MindGeek dismisses as fraudulent.

                              <span>Iron Galaxy’s Rumbleverse, its pro-wrestling-flavored battle royale, is shutting down next month, only seven months after its full launch last August. 
Though Iron Galaxy doesn’t plainly state the reason for Rumbleverse’s demise, a blog post somewhat hints that a lack of substantial players may have played a role, stating in part:
“When you work on a video game, you imagine the community that will show up to play it someday. For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”
Rumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. 
Rumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. 
In similar news, today Konami announced it&#x27;s turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.</span>

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment has delayed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but thankfully the wait won’t be terribly long. Instead of arriving on March 17, the game will now launch a little over a month later on April 28. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Respawn states the game is content complete, and it&#x27;s solely focusing on fixing bugs, ensuring stability, and polishing the experience as much as possible. The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more info on the game, check out our video discussion with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan as well as our most recent preview.</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last year that Guardians of the Galaxy and Peacemaker director James Gunn and Aquaman producer Peter Safran had been hired to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios. Since that reveal, DC fans have speculated what Gunn and Safran&#x27;s new DCU, as the duo is calling the new DC cinematic universe, will look like in the coming years. 
Gunn has teased on Twitter multiple times that he, Safran, and others were formulating their long-spanning plan for the DCU and now, today, the duo has pulled back the curtain on the first 10 projects. All 10 of these projects, which span across movies and TV, will be in Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters.

                              <span>Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.
“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”
Support for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.

Crimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty&#x27;s team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock&#x27;s team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn&#x27;t gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it&#x27;s safe to say that one of Konami&#x27;s &quot;various circumstances&quot; for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.
If you want to try it out, you&#x27;ve got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I&#x27;ve heard Among Us is good.
Do you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


&quot;Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,&quot; Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;re excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.</span>

                              <span>During the 2022 Game Awards, the team behind Dead Cells put out an animated teaser trailer announcing that the game’s next DLC expansion would be Castlevania-themed. It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

                              <span>Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries is reportedly switching from its own internal Slipspace Engine to Unreal Engine for some games in the future. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report stating that the switch from Slipspace to Unreal will begin with a new game under the codename Tatanka, according to the publication&#x27;s sources who are familiar with 343&#x27;s plans. According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions. 


Bloomberg reports that future Halo games &quot;will also explore using the Unreal Engine,&quot; but that some within the studio are skeptical of dropping Slipspace entirely in favor of Epic Gam…</span>

Following a recent Bloomberg report that stated Sony had told supply partners to prepare for a reduction in display panel orders, alongside word that the company had halved its shipment forecast as a result of disappointing pre-order numbers, Sony has refuted the claim in a new statement to GamesIndustry.biz. 
The publication reports that &quot;PlayStation says it has not cut production numbers for its upcoming VR headset,&quot; touching on Bloomberg&#x27;s report. Playstation told GamesIndustry.biz that it is &quot;seeing enthusiasm from PlayStation fans for the upcoming launch, which includes more than 30 titles such as Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Call of the Mountain, and Resident Evil Village.&quot;

                              <span>In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn&#x27;t available for sale.

                              <span>Marvel Snap has taken the world by storm, but one glaring omission fans have asked for is the ability to battle friends instead of only random strangers. As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not often that you see an OLED TV for less than $800, and it&#x27;s even less common to see an OLED gaming monitor for that kind of a price - especially when it&#x27;s Gigabyte&#x27;s well-respected FO48U, a 48-in model that supports 4K 120Hz over HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort. It&#x27;s got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago. 
Now, you can pick it up for $729 at Newegg when you use code JAN2548, an outstanding deal for a monitor of this size and quality.

                              <span>The Corsair MP600 Pro is a great high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD, so to get the 1TB model for $155 at Newegg, a reasonable $45 off, is a deal worth writing about. As you&#x27;d hope from a drive of this calibre, this uses more expensive TLC NAND flash and has a DRAM cache, providing noticeably better sustained performance than QLC drives without a DRAM cache.

                              <span>Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.


“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

                              <span>Microsoft and Sony have been in a months-long back-and-forth over Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition and the issue of Call Of Duty exclusivity, and they’re not done yet. In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision,&quot; but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s not muck about here. Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC. There&#x27;s still much more to Relic Entertainment&#x27;s sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld&#x27;s Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

Hellcard will continue the story of Book Of Demons when it launches into Steam early access on February 16th, but instead of slicing up devil flesh in traditional hack and slash fashion, this time you&#x27;ll be building decks of cards to tackle each dungeon layer as a roguelike.

Fortunately for me, players have already deciphered the ‘Indecipherable’ text log in the new Dead Space remake, revealing a poem that potentially hints toward the series’ future. Naturally, spoilers within.

The leak surfaced on Reddit over the weekend, claiming to be from a &quot;very old alpha&quot; build from summer 2020. It&#x27;s an interesting watch, as while the world and robo dinos look like classic Horizon, the characters jumping around fighting them look a lot more stylised than their hyper-detailed mainline counterparts.

It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

                              <span>Keyboards are eternally horizontal, and moving or rotating them outside of their designated comfort zone feels like an affront to all that is good and right with the world. But that&#x27;s precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it&#x27;s a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe&#x27;s back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you&#x27;re once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.

                              <span>Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there&#x27;s no word on who&#x27;s attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to &quot;build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film.&quot; This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics&#x27; game is already in production, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

                              <span>Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it&#x27;s injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players&#x27; troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite&#x27;s battle royale island with &quot;Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super&quot; on it this morning, alongside tomorrow&#x27;s date. This means we&#x27;ll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn&#x27;t make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here&#x27;s hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There&#x27;s also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live action One Piece series will set sail this year. 
The subscription streaming service revealed this news today with a new image and a poster for the upcoming pirate series based on the long-running (and extremely popular) manga and anime series, One Piece. The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix&#x27;s One Piece logo in the image below as well:

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar&#x27;s Sanji, Emily Rudd&#x27;s Nami, Godoy&#x27;s Luffy, Jacob Gibson&#x27;s Usopp, and Mackenyu&#x27;s Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew&#x27;s ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven&#x27;t seen Netflix&#x27;s One Piece show in motion so here&#x27;s hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 
While waiting for more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

                              <span>The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching&#x27;s family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU &amp; Naughty Dog family! 💔

Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv&#x27;s depiction of her character in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

And they remind us a lot of Uncharted. 
This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

After failing to participate in the original lawsuit, the defendants are now trying to defend their house.

After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
The first five games by Japanese indie developer iTA-Choco Systems.
