                              <span>&quot;It’s a shame people won’t be able to watch these&quot;.
A year ago, subscribers of Nintendo of America&#x27;s official YouTube channel got quite a shock when &#x27;Nintendo Minute&#x27; hosts Kit and Krysta uploaded their final video after more than 8 years and over 400 episodes.
If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to go back and relive the journey, you might want to hurry up. After just over a year since their departure from Nintendo, Kit and Krysta have noted on social media how Nintendo is now setting these episodes to private.

The Nintendo 64 era was loaded with plenty of exciting first-party releases, but one that you might not always consider when reflecting on this generation is Yoshi&#x27;s Story. This delightful side-scrolling platfomer was first released in Japan in 1997 and today marks a special milestone.
Yes, believe it or not, but the N64 title Yoshi&#x27;s Story is now officially 25 years old based on its original release on 21st December 1997. To celebrate this occasion, Nintendo has taken time out of its own busy schedule on social media to ask fans their favourite memories.

2022 saw gaming shift in a lot of big ways. But amid a clamor of big headlines, Valve managed to work its way into the home console space with the Steam Deck this year. And this one really seems like it&#x27;s going to stick it out.
Valve has had a, let&#x27;s say, interesting record when it comes to home hardware launches. The build-your-own PC nature of the Steam Machine didn&#x27;t really take off, and neither did the Steam Link.

                              <span>Super quick, very good card battler Marvel Snap rolls out a new location every week, then boosts it with a 40% likelihood to appear for 48 hours. New, temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up, imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. 
The latest location, Vormir, is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our (unrelated) animations, which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a match&#x27;s normal running time.

It&#x27;s a procedurally generated game made for 7dfps 2022, a game jam that challenges folks to make an fps game in seven days. Your manor will be different to mine, but the toilets will probably still be silly.

Goat Sim developers Coffee Stain Studios knew this would happen, and they knew people would report on it when it did. I am facilitating shenanigans, and I can hear that damn goat laughing at me from within the black void of its copyright takedown notice.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that&#x27;s a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it&#x27;s oh so satisfying.
We&#x27;ve written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer&#x27;s issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it&#x27;s getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.

                              <span>Some point-and-click adventures prefer their heroes all comedic and wacky, your Guybrush types. Others are more stoic and action-orientated, such as Indy Jones or Graham of Daventry. Who fits better as an adventure game protagonist than Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, though? The Lost Files Of Sherlock Holmes: The Case Of The Serrated Scalpel taught me that when I was about eight years old, trying to figure out its mysteries while sitting at my dad’s Amstrad 286 accompanied by my sister Gem. Okay, I was definitely the Watson of that duo.

                              <span>Bricky puzzle game Lego Builder’s Journey is the latest freebie being given away on the Epic Games Store as part of their Christmas sale. Honestly, I did not immediately mistake this for Lego Bricktales, which I’m sure you didn’t either. Builder’s Journey tasks you with solving puzzles by, well, building with Lego. It’s also a bit of a looker, with some snazzy visual accoutrements such as ray tracing and global illumination. You can have a watch of the very pretty Builder’s Journey trailer below.

                              <span>Last time, you decided by a narrow margin that becoming overpowered is better than a chunky manual. With no chunky manual to teach you a game&#x27;s systems, I guess you&#x27;ll be busy experimenting with that for a while. This week, I&#x27;ve had a queer fancy to (for once) make you pick between things which have absolutely no connection. What&#x27;s better: seasonal events, or dynamic snow? I know, it&#x27;s a bit of a silly choice, but hey, it&#x27;s the last week of work before Christmas, let&#x27;s goof off.

Overwatch 2’s marking the occasion by turning robotic damage hero Bastion into a gingerbread automaton with a new legendary skin. Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost. Bastion’s fresh look is also quite a bit more involved than some of the other legendary efforts Blizzard’s dreamt up for Overwatch 2 so far.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven&#x27;t played enough to give you a big wot I think. It&#x27;s worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It&#x27;s a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she&#x27;s in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they&#x27;re right.
Yaga&#x27;s childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it&#x27;s a little bit janky in ways that don&#x27;t break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It&#x27;s the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don&#x27;t get much anymore.

                              <span>Just as Tiktok riffed on Vine for a new generation, co-op rhythm game Disaster Band’s taken the bold spirit of Wii Music and turned it into a nail-biting way for up to four people to parp out the greatest hits of Edvard Grieg. There’s Steam Workshop support too, so you can always chuck in your own self-penned future hits to jam along with. Have a watch of the game’s trailer below, if you don’t overly value your ears.

In an interview with Game Informer, Jedi Survivor’s director Stig Asmussen discussed some of the features that distinguish the action RPG from its predecessor Fallen Order, including mounts and new fighting stances for Cal Kestis’ trusty lightsaber.

The low-fi indie developers of the Haunted PS1 community have another Madvent Calendar this year, offering another 24 small horror games and oddities released daily. So far, these have ranged from an extreme snowboarding murder game to a pleasant little online social network where you leave messages for other people by decorating plants and plaques in a sunny courtyard. A lovely thing, and free!

For now, the keycards needed to enter Building 21 are disabled. It seems like these keycards may have been the reason for the lockdown, although Infinity Ward have yet to explain just why Building 21 is shutting its doors temporarily. The lockdown was announced in a tweet, which only cryptically referred to the cause.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Season 5 update is also its last major one
Major support for Chocobo GP is coming to an end. Today, Square Enix confirms that there won&#x27;t be any further large-scale updates to Chocobo GP after the Season 5 update that goes live today, December 21.
What it means by &quot;large-scale&quot; is that major additions, like new characters or maps, will not be arriving in any further updates. Season 5 will also be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the special Chocobo GP mode. The GP mode will still be playable and rankings will continue, without the use of prize pass levels, in the same manner as the current season off period.
Sales of Mythril, a currency for the shop, have also been discontinued on the Nintendo eShop. Players who have Mythril can still spend it, up until the shop disappears on January 6, 2023. The currency is not refundable either.
New items will continue to be added to the shop during the course of Season 5, but the same items may also go into the ticket or gil shops, making them available without Mythril. Items originally added to the Mythril shop during Seasons 1 through 4 &quot;may&quot; also be added to the ticket or gil shops, per Square Enix&#x27;s announcement.

Hitting the brakes
This effectively means Chocobo GP is hitting the brakes on its online support. New characters and maps are coming to a close, the premium currency shop is closing, and it sounds like Season 5 will be the last major one.
It&#x27;s a bummer to see. Chocobo GP didn&#x27;t receive the warmest reception, but my fond memories of Chocobo Racing had me hoping this one would turn things around a bit over time. It looks like that&#x27;s not the case, as the game&#x27;s ending major support within the same calendar year as its launch.

The longest gaming session I have ever had was six straight hours of Cult of the Lamb. This may not be a huge feat for many of you, but I am in shock that for six hours, I didn&#x27;t drink water, eat food, or even use the bathroom. My entire day flew by while I gathered followers and tended my garden.
Was it fun? Yeah. My camp looks really good, and I sacrificed my first dissenter. But my neck hurt after, and I was jittery like there were bees in my brain. I can&#x27;t even imagine the dedication it took for the first player to achieve max renown in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight.

The latest Pokémon game is out in the wild, and players have been exploring the new region of Paldea. As it so happens, some of the tunes playing while they roam around this Pokémon world were penned by Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale.
Fox announced he&#x27;d be working on Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s soundtrack before the game&#x27;s release. Now, Fox has shared his exact contributions in a newsletter mailing list that he spun up for fans of Undertale and Deltarune. (Destructoid has received a copy of this because yes, I would like to receive news about Undertale and Deltarune.)
In it, the developer writes that he had the honor of making a few songs for the game. These include the tracks &quot;Tera Raid Battles&quot;, the &quot;Academy Ace Tournament&quot;, …</span>

I talk about this often in reviews, but one of my favorite parts of the gig is playing games in complete isolation. When the discourse starts with some games it&#x27;s impossible to escape, but there&#x27;s nothing quite like immersing yourself in a massive JRPG in utter silence and taking it all in. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was one of my favorite of those experiences in recent memory: which is why I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s winning our award for best Switch game of 2022.
Once it actually came out, it was amazing to see the positive reactions folks had, especially the connections many forged with the really strong sidequests and diversions. It&#x27;s one thing for a JRPG to give us a strong cast and engaging narrative; but it&#x27;s another thing entirely to ensure that the same amount of car…</span>

If you haven&#x27;t been following, Nintendo&#x27;s been holding an advent calendar-style indie spotlight event this week. Each day, a new batch of games is unveiled; historically, half have been announcements of forthcoming games, and half are shadow drops, adding new games to the Switch eShop.

                              <span>Neptunia developer to kick off the year in style
Compile Heart, the Japanese developer behind the relentless Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise, has announced that it has a grand reveal planned to kick off its new year. The announcement will be made in the January 19 issue of popular publication Weekly Famitsu, though no further details were announced.
At this point, we can do little but speculate, but given Compile Heart&#x27;s seemingly endless ability to repackage the cheesecake universe of Nep-Nep and friends into almost any genre, we can only assume that the residents of Gameindustri are getting set to embark upon another colorful and goofy adventure.
The most recent title in the series, Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters launched in Japan in the spring of this year, and is headed west next month — just in time for this new announcement, in fact. Convenient. Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters will launch January 2023 on PlayStation and PC platforms, and will be the first title in the series since 2018&#x27;s Super Neptunia RPG to feature a fully localized English dub.

                              <span>Open the grimoire once more in 2023
The latest from Vanillaware has a western release date. GrimGrimoire OnceMore arrives for PlayStation 4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2023.
This remaster of Vanillaware&#x27;s PlayStation 2 game GrimGrimoire updated the resolution and screen ratio, while also adding some new gameplay features. New and improved mechanics have been added to its magical school RTS battles, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wOFwoilgAeE
The setup of GrimGrimoire OnceMore is that you&#x27;re Lillet Blan, a new student at Silver Star Tower, training to become a great magician. But as mysteries and secrets are uncovered, Lillet will have to fight using her familiars to uncover the truth.
It&#x27;s a bit of a strange set-up, but looks absolutely gorgeous in motion. I&#x27;m personally pretty interested in this just to see the RTS development of Vanillaware&#x27;s from years past. The studio is well-known for its 2D action games, but 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim also took on a strategy approach and knocked it out of the park, becoming one of my favorite games of 2020.
Play it one more time
Seeing more of Vanillaware&#x27;s back catalog get the remaster treatment is certainly exciting, too. Between 13 Sentinels and the Odin Sphere remake, I&#x27;ve been drawn back into the studio&#x27;s work. So getting to see another piece of its history updated for modern consoles is a delight.
With English and Japanese voice options, new spells to wield, and more to explore, there&#x27;s a lot to like here. GrimGrimoire is charging into a heavily packed 2023 launch lineup, for sure. But with April looking particularly thin if you&#x27;re not a Dead Island fan, I think there will be some time found to play through this one.

A big part of a creative process is knowing that it&#x27;s okay to start over. You might have an amazing initial idea, but as you put it into action, whether writing a book, drawing a picture, or making a game, you might discover that you can do better than that first idea. And that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s all part of the process. Just ask Ken Levine.
But sometimes, you get lucky, and the first idea you have knocks it out of the park. That&#x27;s what happened with Second Dinner, the developers behind Destructoid&#x27;s pick for the Best Mobile Game of 2022. As studio co-founder Ben Brode told the Washington Post in October:
&quot;We came up with the idea for ‘Marvel Snap’ pretty quickly. In fact, it was so fun so fast, we actually put it on pause and said, ‘Look, we’ve got to explore some other stuff. We ca…</span>

                              <span>PC port pushes fantasy RPG into the gold
Square Enix has proudly announced that its tactical fantasy adventure Triangle Strategy has sold over one million copies. The Artdink-developed RPG launched on Nintendo Switch last spring, and recently received a sales boost thanks to the release of a PC port in October.
A turn-based tactical affair, Triangle Strategy is one of the more recent offerings from RPG veteran Tomoyo Asano, producer of such gems as Octopath Traveler and the Bravely Default franchise. The story concerns the war-torn continent of Nozelia, as three countries continue a violent conflict that has raged for some three decades. The player guides noble protagonist Serenoa Wolffort as they, (and their compatriots) attempt to negotiate the machinations of a world at war.
To celebrate the sales milestone, Square Enix has announced a limited-time 40% off sale for the PC edition, now live on Steam. So if you&#x27;re yet to get involved in the power and politics of Triangle Strategy, now presents an opportunity for you to get into the thick of the action for almost half of the retail price! While the Nintendo Switch release is also mentioned in the tweet as being part of the discount, the eShop is currently listing this edition at full price.

During yesterday&#x27;s House of Indies broadcast, Nintendo announced that Hopoo Games&#x27; Risk of Rain Returns will be coming to the Switch platform in 2023, alongside its previously announced PC release.
Published by Gearbox, Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered and enhanced edition of the smash hit 2013 platformer, initially devised by two Washington University students using Gamemaker development software. Players take part in a challenging race against time, as stranded space explorers who must quickly and efficiently mount a defense against enormous waves of aliens and monsters. Simple in concept but hugely compelling, Risk of Rain would go on to sell over four million copies and be the recipient of several awards within the creative sphere.

Risk of Rain Returns is a fully revised version of the original game, which features remastered visuals, (well, as much as you can &quot;remaster&quot; 8-bit graphics), 15 unique Survivor classes, 10 run-altering Artifacts, and fully overhauled multiplayer modes — featuring support for one-to-four players in online and local co-op action. While the game itself is now approaching its 10th anniversary, the Risk of Rain gameplay remains as frenzied and engrossing today as it was a decade ago. Time to get lost, all over again.
Risk of Rain Returns launches in 2023 on PC and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>13.5 million total players is the main stat
Fallout 76 has had a wild ride since its release...wow, over four years ago?! It&#x27;s crazy to think how many things have changed since then, Fallout 76 included! It&#x27;s gone from one of the biggest AAA disasters in recent memory to a respectable main/side game for many. This week, Bethesda released a &quot;2022 retrospective&quot; of sorts, complete with an infographic.
As is usually the case with these things, the info therein ranges from useful to silly. The main stat is that 13.5 million players engaged with the game in 2022 (keep in mind it&#x27;s on Game Pass, and was offered for free several times): and from there, it gets a little more inside baseball.
If you play the game, you might find some of the other useless stats humorous, like the thumbs up taking the crown as the most popular emote, or the fact that there&#x27;s been 2.9 million nukes dropped. Oh, and that folks prefer forest locations for setting up their camps/home base. &quot;Boiled water&quot; taking the top spot as the most prepared food/drink (combined!) is also funny to me.
With the massive Pitt update in the rear view and the new season afoot, folks are wondering what 2023 has in store for Fallout 76. Hopefully it still includes some combination of free access via Game Pass, as well as a healthy mix of smaller/bigger patches.
A great big Fallout 76 2022 recap:

Inti Creates has announced that its incoming release Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is just about ready to unleash its flurry of pixelated horror on the world. The Gothic anime actioner will launch on PC and console platforms on February 23, 2023.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge sees two young sisters venture into a foreboding castle on a quest to purge their school from its demonic presence. One or two players control older sister Shinobu, who is locked and loaded with a crazy arsenal of long-range weaponry, and her younger sibling Maya, who has mastered the deadly art of... erm... origami. Combining the destructive capabilities of the former with the precision and adaptation of the latter, our two heroes will head deeper into the grim locale, battling a gallery of monsters, ghoulies, and terrifying and unholy boss characters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;o7uWrjl95k4&amp;t
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge looks to combine the run-and-gun action of the 1990s with the classic Gothic overtones of the Castlevania series, dressed up in a pleasing anime cheese aesthetic. An array of secrets, weapons, and spells await, while a &quot;Style&quot; based scoring system will reward those who utilize a sense of fluidity in their relentless monster-mashing. Sporting delightful pixel-based visuals and classic arcade sound, Grim Guardians simply looks like good, unabashed fun, particularly in co-op, and has quickly found its way onto my radar for the first quarter of the coming year.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 23, 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>It&#x27;s part of a long line of Sonic Frontiers updates: both big and small
In case you missed it, Sonic Frontiers just recently put out a &quot;2023 roadmap,&quot; and there&#x27;s a lot on it. Before we actually get to the new year though there&#x27;s a bit of free DLC to be had: including a &quot;Holiday Cheer&quot; Christmas suit.
As confirmed by the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, the DLC suit is out today, on top of the prior Monster Hunter DLC. If you need a rundown of how all this skin DLC works (it&#x27;s not intuitive), we have a full breakdown here.

As a reminder, here&#x27;s what the Sonic Frontiers 2023 roadmap looks like
Update 1: Juke Box, Photo Mode, New Challenge Modes
Update 2: Sonic&#x27;s Birthday celebration, Open Zone Challenge, New Koco
Update 3: Playable Characters (Tails, Knuckles, Amy), and &quot;new story&quot;
If the team can fix a lot of the technical issues plaguing Sonic Frontiers, it should have a really, really long tail: uncharacteristically long, in fact. Folks have already taken to Sonic Frontiers more so than a lot of other modern 3D Sonic games, so more content and fixes will only help its case. Until all of the major stuff rolls out, we can mess around with the minor cosmetic DLC.

&quot;Joy-Con Drift&quot;, as you will no doubt remember, referred to a frequent problem in the Switch&#x27;s lifespan which would see one or both thumbsticks roll off-center, resulting in on-screen movement even when the sticks were stationary. The flaw resulted in numerous complaints from users and led to several class-action lawsuits being filed against Nintendo, leading to Nintendo improving the controller&#x27;s design but open admitting that instances of drift would be &quot;unavoidable&quot;.

This may sound funny coming from someone who clearly took the time to write this list, but... how do you rank Mario games?
Everything that I said about ranking Zelda games applies here. Except, also, what is a Mario game? I mean, we all know the big ones count, like Super Mario Bros for the NES or Super Mario 64. Yet does Super Mario RPG count as a Mario game? Does Captain Toad&#x27;s Treasure Tracker? Is Donkey Kong a Mario game? I know I&#x27;m not the first person to dive into this question, but it does impact this entire list. Not only are my opinions subject to debate (as they should be), the very qualifications of what belongs on the list can be contested.
For the sake of some consistency, I&#x27;ve limited this list to platformers that most would agree are Mario games. T…</span>

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight the crew discusses Mortal Shell launching on Switch, Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters coming to most consoles, and a new rumored 2D Mario game in the works!

Zippo claimed last August that a new 2D Mario game is in the works and it&#x27;ll have an art style that will “surprise” people. They also claimed it will feature online multiplayer. Lastly, this alleged new 2D Mario game will not be a part of the &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; series.
Fast-forward to now, Zippo returns with some new info about the alleged 2D Mario game. Apparently, Mario, Luigi,…</span>

Digital Eclipse teased a brand new update for their outstanding TMNT compilation, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, yesterday. And today, in a livestream, the developer has shared some of the major details that are part of the game&#x27;s first big update — including a new Home icon (thanks, Gematsu!).
The game&#x27;s first update is available to download right now on the Switch, and the other big headliner is that online multiplayer has been added to Turtles in Time (SNES). Radical! You can now play one of the best TMNT games of all time online with friends!

                              <span>Our personal picks for the best Switch games of 2022.
Another year has come and gone (almost) and once more we&#x27;re looking back over all the games we&#x27;ve played, along with those we wish we had played. It&#x27;s been a great year for Switch releases, with a crop of excellent first-party Nintendo games joined by some great third-party offerings (Square Enix, in particular, has been on fire the last few months), plus choice ports of older titles and more incredible indies than we know what to do with.
While our Top 50 reader-ranked list of the Best Switch Games of 2022 serves as the main course in our GOTY rankings (and will be published soon!), we also publish an annual NL staff GOTY list. Typically, we compile all nominations in a spreadsheet, and then everyone on staff adds points in reverse order for their top 10 games of the year, which is then tabulated to create our 10 staff picks. This is fine but a) it tends to produce a crop very similar to our reader-ranked counterpart, and b) smaller games — ones that rank very highly on our personal lists — usually get pushed off the bottom by familiar big-name fare, despite the passion they inspire in individual team members.

Chocobo GP, Square Enix&#x27;s adorable (and slightly controversial) kart racer is getting its Season 5 update today, bringing with it two new racers and a stage based on Midgar from Final Fantasy VII. However, the developer seems to have confirmed that today&#x27;s update is the game&#x27;s last major one, with changes to the game&#x27;s operating model going forward.
In a notice shared on Square&#x27;s website, &quot;Season 5 will be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the Chocobo GP mode&quot;. Sales of Mythril, the in-game currency, have also been suspended with today&#x27;s update. You&#x27;ll still be able to spend the Mythril you&#x27;ve earned up to 00:00 on 6th January 2023 JST (that&#x27;s 10am on 5th January 2023 EST, or 3pm GMT on the 5th January), but after this date, your Mythril will become invalid and the in-game Mythril shop will be closed.

As revealed in today&#x27;s Inside the House of Indies event, Sail Forth has made its way onto the Switch eShop, bringing with it heavy gusts of Wind Waker vibes.
This release has been a long time coming. After pushing back its 2021 release, developer Festive Vector (seems fit for the season) and publisher Quantum Astrophysicists Guild (not quite as seasonal) have finally released a game which is all about the sailing - and in a shadow drop no less!

                              <span>Same result as BOTW.
It appears that the hotly-anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has received its official rating for North America by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (or ESRB, if you will).
Unsurprisingly, the game has been rated E10+, with warnings of Fantasy Violence and Mild Suggestive Themes (thanks, Go Nintendo). This places the game in exactly the same position as its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, which received the same rating back in 2017.

NIS America has announced that GrimGrimoire OnceMore, the enhanced release of Vanillaware&#x27;s 2007 RTS game GrimGrimoire, is coming out on Switch in the west on 4th April in North America and 7th April in Europe.
First announced back in April this year, GrimGrimoire OnceMore retains the original PS2 release&#x27;s gameplay while adding some brand-new features to help lure in budding magicians who&#x27;ve never played the game before. If you picked up 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on Switch earlier this year, the GrimGrimoire might be your next foray into Vanillaware&#x27;s beautiful back catalogue.

It&#x27;s been a busy week for Falcom, but the legendary Japanese developer has even more news to share for its 2023 plans. In an interview with Famitsu (translated by Ryoktuya2089 via Gematsu), Falcom President Toshihiro Kondo said that the company wants to release three &quot;refined&quot; titles in total, following the announcement of Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana.
Previously, Kondo has gone on record stating that up to the end of September 2023, Falcom wants to release three titles for the Switch. Ys Memoire, the enhanced rerelease of the 2010 PSP action RPG Ys: The Oath in Felghana, is due to launch on the Switch in Spring 2023, meaning the remaining two titles Kondo is teasing will likely be coming to Switch. Whether these are other refined Ys titles or not, we&#x27;re yet to know.

                              <span>Pale imitation.
Described by developer Condradical as &quot;Paper Mario + Undertale&quot; on the game&#x27;s Kickstarter page, The Outbound Ghost garnered some attention with its aesthetic and gameplay along with its premise: the residents of the town of Outbound all quite suddenly died. Many of them have lingering burdens that keep them from moving onto the afterlife. You initially assume the role of an amnesiac ghost as he explores the town, meeting its spectral residents and uncovering a bit by bit what exactly happened. It sounds grim, sure, but it’s all wrapped up in a cutesy package that never devolves too much into the macabre. The game has finally arrived (though not without drama between Conradical and publisher Digerati) and can be played on a Nintendo platform, as all papery RPGs should.
If you’ve played Paper Mario before, the gameplay loop is quite similar. While exploring the areas around Outbound, touching a malevolent enemy in the overworld will trigger a turn-based battle. In battle you control four of a selection of figments of your own psyche – Solitude, Spite, Comradery, and so on – that manifest themselves as party members. Attacks are reflex-based, with an improperly timed button press resulting in a miss and a perfectly timed one increasing damage.

PlatinumGames has announced that its standard shmup from earlier this year, Sol Cresta, is having a whole new wave of content added to it in the form of DLC packages and a free update.
While the no-cost additions focus on expanding the game&#x27;s Caravan Mode as well as the usual tweaks to the player experience, the DLC is all about the roster. Made up of three individual purchases (or one bundle for those who want to splash out all at once), the downloadable content adds in fighters from Sol Cresta&#x27;s 1980s predecessors: Moon Cresta, Terra Cresta and Terra Cresta II: Mandler no Gyakushuu.

After releasing back in March of this year, Square Enix has announced that TRIANGLE STRATEGY has now sold over one million copies worldwide (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
For a game that managed to shift 800,000 units in its first two weeks of release, this is a slowing number, it is true. However, for a genre which is not as popular today as it once was and a game which was exclusive to Switch for the most part (it later received a Steam release in October), one million is still an impressive number.

Kirby is still kind of celebrating his 30th anniversary. Following on from last week&#x27;s Tetris 99 event, the pink puff has now got a new First 4 Figures statue. It&#x27;s officially known as the &quot;We Love Kirby mini metal statue&quot;.
Fortunately, it&#x27;s not quite as expensive as the company&#x27;s usual offerings, priced at just $65.99 USD (or your regional equivalent) for early birds. After this period it will cost $76.99. Pre-orders are now open, it&#x27;s estimated to release in Q2 2023, and there will also be silver and gold variants made available at &quot;later dates&quot;.

This new release date comes a little more than a month after its release was set for January 19th, but I won&#x27;t look a gift seahorse in the mouth. There&#x27;s also a new trailer below which breaks down how you&#x27;ll build your very own Rapture equivalent.

                              <span>The cat game reigned supreme in 2022, but there&#x27;s a chance 2023 could be the year of the gecko game. That&#x27;s how I feel after watching the trailer for The Gecko Gods, at least. It&#x27;s an action adventure in which you control a cute little lizard who can crawl across walls and ceilings, and also solves puzzles, fights golems and pilots a boat.

                              <span>Wolfenstein: The New Order rebooted the classic FPS series back in 2014, turning it into a tonally incoherent, ultra-violent sometime-stealth &#x27;em up about murdering robo-Nazis in an alternate 1960s. It was surprisingly great. It&#x27;s also free to keep if you grab it from the Epic Games Store right now.

There was also the promise that Hopoo and Gearbox were working on one remaining Risk Of Rain project together, however.

It was announced today: Risk Of Rain Returns, a remaster of the 2013 2D roguelike with all new pixel art, new survivors and new everything else.

The weighty Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy RPG has been in early access for a couple of years, but it&#x27;s now scheduled for a 1.0 release in August next year. As well as that, BG3 got its ninth update, the last significant one before release, which raises the level cap to 5 and adds Paladin as a playable class. I caught up with Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke (this time sans full suit of armour) and he told me that, despite Update 9 being a big one, there&#x27;s still a lot to come.

                              <span>If I were only allowed to give a single, solitary reason for trying Control, I’d probably settle on this: it has the most satisfying “throw desk at face” interaction I’ve experienced in a game. Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.

From the snippets Sloclap have shown, the update will have a new arenas mode that seems to be similar to combat challenge maps from the Arkham series. A new patch, 1.16, has also gone live for Sifu today to duff up some pesky crashes and bugs, although patch notes haven’t been released yet. You can watch the teaser for the arenas mode update below.

                              <span>The Winter Sale continues over on GOG, and they’re giving away Revolution Software’s classic point-and-click Broken Sword for free until Thursday. It’s the Director’s Cut too, which adds some more stuff for nosey American tourist George ‘Goat-wrangler’ Stobbart and French journalist Nico ‘Curtains’ Collard to investigate. Good grief, I can’t even remember the last time I played a Broken Sword. The first one is a classic adventure game from a time when they were beginning to fade from PC, goat puzzle notwithstanding.

                              <span>Shipmas arrives in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 tomorrow, with the game’s Christmas update for multiplayer. The reimagined version of the classic Shipment map - introduced with last week’s Season 01 Reloaded midseason update - will be festooned with decorations, along with the bodies of your enemies. COD now has its own Santa, too, and I wouldn’t want to tangle with him. You can see what I mean, and catch a glimpse of the holiday version of Shipment, by watching the trailer below.

Alone or with a party of pals, you head into dungeons to mash AI-controlled monsters and fill your pockets with loot. Other players are out there doing the same, and might come to claim your goodies, especially as you&#x27;re all competing for the limited escape portals that let you keep your shinies. It&#x27;s an interesting one, and doing well on both Steam and Twitch.

If you open the door wrong you could cause a huge explosion that kills you - but to mitigate that risk you can spend money buying an Official Safe Door Opener. Don&#x27;t worry, you can just work more to pay it off.

LucasArts shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces has been given a modern makeover by The Force Engine project, and they’ve just released version 1.0 to the public after three years&#x27; work. During that time, the team’s reverse engineered Dark Forces and added a whole bunch of mod-cons, such as support for modern high resolutions and mouse-look. The project even has a trailer, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Hello, yes, I know this is our fourth post on the subject but it’s mostly good news – The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update is now considerably less of a technical muddle. After applying yesterday’s PC hotfix, performance with the new ray tracing settings is majorly improved, and if you don’t (or can’t) use those, The Witcher 3 no longer runs slower than it did before the next-gen update hobbled it. 


That’s judging by some tests I’ve run using the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, on which overall stability seems to have improved as well. I’m still having trouble with AMD graphics cards, however, with FSR upscaling being a particularly reliable source of crashes.

                              <span>&quot;Do not be afraid to die.&quot; That&#x27;s the advice of Haemimont Games&#x27; CEO Bisser Dyankov when it comes to playing their new open world survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn. Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you&#x27;re at it. 
The world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded&#x27;s initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I&#x27;ve settled on a couple of vital dos and don&#x27;ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don&#x27;t: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it&#x27;s going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to &quot;challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,&quot; Dyankov tells me. &quot;Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it&#x27;s a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.&quot; I&#x27;ll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors&#x27; legs off.

Described as an “end of time adventure gacha puzzle apocalypse visual novel simulation horror trip”, Roman Sands RE:Build hails from the devs behind horror game Paratopic. It’s got a vaguely vaporwave sensibility that reminds me a smidge of Paradise Killer. Watch the trailer for Roman Sands RE:Build below, and please explain to me if you understand what’s going on.

                              <span>Which game brings the most holiday cheer?
Seasonal events in live service games are something I look forward to every year. Whether they&#x27;re for the holiday season at the end of the year, or the best time of the year aka spooky season, it&#x27;s always a good time to collect all the themed cosmetics and jump into a special game mode that will only be around for so long. These days, pretty much every live service game worth its salt has a holiday event to speak of, and with so many great ones out there (and a few that deserve a lump of coal), I had to do what we games journalists do — I had to rank them.
So here&#x27;s my list of the live service holiday events of 2022. When it came to the games I chose, it came down to which titles I play, are intrigued by, or believe to generally have a big audience…</span>

                              <span>And the &quot;biggest 3rd Party Game Pass launch ever&quot;
Over on the Game Pass charts (on both PC and console), I noticed that High on Life was jumping up quickly after launch. But today, Microsoft fully confirmed my inkling: the game is a bona fide success on Game Pass.
The Squanch Games release was apparently &quot;Xbox Game Pass’ biggest launch of 2022,&quot; as well as &quot;the biggest 3rd party Game Pass launch of all time, and the biggest release of a single player-only game in the service’s history.&quot; Where does Microsoft actually get those stats? They&#x27;re based on the &quot;number of hours played in the first five days of release.&quot; In both an email to Destructoid and on the Xbox Wire blog itself, Microsoft uses the phrase &quot;millions of players&quot; to describe the userbase playing right now.
Despite my misgivings with the game, as I pointed out in my review, High on Life might be the the most ideal Game Pass game to date (especially since it has a $60 MSRP). It&#x27;s so janky that you&#x27;d possibly be pissed if you spent $60 on it, but on a lark as an &quot;extra&quot; on Game Pass, it&#x27;s great to dive into with no context as patches roll out for it.
Not only that, but given that so much of High on Life is based on Roiland&#x27;s subjective sense of humor, you may not even enjoy the entire vibe altogether. While many of those jokes are hit or miss, one of the best things about it is the &quot;90s adventure game&quot; feeling it has, Easter eggs and meta-references and all. I wish it had a bit more polish, but it&#x27;s great to see Squanch Games getting a win either way.

Bandai Namco has offered up a little more information on its previously teased &quot;Project Sand Land&quot; endeavor, focusing on the short-lived but well-received manga by Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama.
According to the publisher, Project Sand Land consists of several creative endeavors, produced by a variety of well-known manga, anime, and game producers. The first and foremost of these tributes will be a full &quot;visual adaptation&quot; of the original 2000 manga series. This cinematic project will be produced by veteran anime studios Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga, and ANIMA, and is scheduled to premiere in 2023. Bandai Namco&#x27;s insistence on referring to the production as a &quot;visual adaptation&quot; rather than a &quot;film&quot; or an &quot;anime&quot; leaves a few questions up in the air. but we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.
You can check out a teaser trailer for the adaptation below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;--plyeEv4Ag&amp;t&#x3D;53s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
As we previously recanted, Sand Land was dystopian adventure series set within a world that had become almost entirely desert, with water becoming the single most important form of currency. With his local town dry as a bone, aging sheriff Rao teams up with Prince of Demons Beelzebub (no, really), and impish mischief maker Thief on an odyssey to uncover the location of the legendary Phantom Lake and return a source of hydration to his hometown.
While the visual adaptation is the only endeavor revealed by Bandai Namco so far, the publisher suggests that it has other creative projects in the works, with more reveals to be made across 2023, given the studio&#x27;s interest, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that there may be a Sand Land video game in the works. For now, we&#x27;re just going to have to hold fast and keep our tanks gassed up and ready to rock.

When I first covered the rumor that Square Enix was reaching well into its own past to dig up long-lost Super Famicom release Live A Live, I will admit that, despite being pleased with the preservation element, I didn&#x27;t really think that the endeavor would amount to much. After all, various &#x27;90s classics have been resurrected time and again, only to fall short of their former glories or, in the worst cases, miss the point entirely.
But Live A Live was something different. Live A Live, launched in 1994 at the tail-end of the 16-bit reign, was both ambitious and way ahead of its time. The unknown release featured a slew of characters and worlds, multiple backstories, and a fascinating chrono-conundrum set against the backdrop of eight different time periods — from prehistory and …</span>

                              <span>New ways to beat up some baddies arrive next year
Martial arts brawler Sifu is heading to new platforms in the new year, and it&#x27;ll have a new mode too. Developer Sloclap is bringing Sifu to Xbox and Steam in March 2023, as well as a new Arenas mode.
Up to this point, Sifu has been available on PlayStation consoles, PC via Epic, and the Nintendo Switch. When it arrives on Xbox and Steam, it&#x27;ll go for $39.99. That will include the free updates the game has received in the time since launch, including the recent fall update with a Replay Editor and the upcoming Arenas mode update.
Arenas mode, which will be part of a free update this spring, will add nine new maps with special challenges. Completing the arena challenges will unlock new modifiers, as well as add some alternative moves to the protagonist&#x27;s arsenal. It&#x27;s always nice to have some extra tricks up your sleeve when enacting your vengeance, right? The Arenas will also unlock new cheats and special new outfits, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sXW_4aIEV3Q
On a quest for revenge
Sifu was one of the earlier hits of 2022, arriving just at the start of February. Following a martial arts student whose master is slain by a rival organization. As the student, you go on a quest for vengeance, fueled by a magical artifact that lets you spring back to life at the cost of years of your life.
It&#x27;s a really fun brawler, and fitting follow-up to Sloclap&#x27;s previous game Absolver. With the new updates, it seems like a lot has been added to freshen up the experience, and a special Arenas mode is a no-brainer for Sifu. Looks like there will be a good reason to get back into the brawl next year.

                              <span>It&#x27;s live today through January 3
Although Overwatch doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same cachet it once enjoyed in the Overwatch 2 era, it&#x27;s still chugging along with the seasonal model: which includes new heroes. This holiday update is a little less exciting, but it does involve a nearly-free skin.
Blizzard has announced today that the Legendary Gingerbread Bastion skin will cost one Overwatch 2 coin (the main currency of the new iteration of the game). The promotion will run from today through January 3. You can check out the skin in the header image, and see if it&#x27;s even worth your time logging in (or installing it at all, depending on your reaction to the semi-sequel).
I guess it&#x27;s a good thing Bastion was fixed
You may recall that late in the year, Bastion was busted, and was taken out of the rotation completely. As a recap, Blizzard posted the following Twitter message on October 10: &quot;Bastion and Torbjörn will be taking a quick trip to the workshop while we iron out a few bugs in their ability kits! Bastion will be unavailable in all modes during this time, while Torbjörn will still be playable in Quick Play.&quot; Bastion in particular was able to exploit his ultimate, leading to a swift recall of the hero.
Bastion was added back to the game on October 25, and joins a line of heroes (among other things like at least one map) that were removed from the game due to bugs.

Day 2 of Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies holiday event is upon us, and the team is opening Door #2. Two more shadowdrops have arrived, as well as two announcements of upcoming games slated for 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6qXjO6eQm34
First up, the play-it-now games for today. The Captain is a new narrative adventure from Sysiac Games and Tomorrow Corporation. You play a lost science officer from the space fleet, trying to work their way back home with some precious info. Lots of choices wait to be made, as well as big space battles to get caught up in.
If penguins are more your style, The Punchuin is a new game from The Touryst team Shin&#x27;en. You play as a penguin who punches things, and is trying to see all there is to see on Punch Mountain. It&#x27;s part match-three puzzle, and part-charming exploration and adventure, but all punchy penguin.
Forecast calls for more rain
Two more games got revealed today too, locking in for a 2023 launch window. The first is The Gecko Gods, a puzzle platformer from Inresin and Super Rare Originals. It asks, &quot;what if a gecko could explore a mysterious and dangerous island?&quot; It&#x27;s all in the pursuit of saving their friend, who I hope is also a small and adorable gecko. That&#x27;s set to arrive in 2023.
A popular roguelike is also on the way back, too. Risk of Rain Returns is a remastered version of the original Risk of Rain from Hopoo Games and Gearbox Publishing. It looks to have all the 2D chaos of the original, but with a new coat of paint and apparently new ways to play in store too. The rain returns in 2023.
There are still three days left this week in Nintendo&#x27;s House of Indies advent calendar. Tune back in tomorrow morning for the next bout of indie surprises for the Switch.

Sometimes, giving out awards for the best game of the year can feel a bit tedious, because there will be one title that stood head and shoulders above the rest. While in 2022, it may have been easy to predict that a game like Elden Ring would take home our pick for the best PlayStation title of the year, the PC category was a real toss up — of all the categories our staff voted on, the votes for the PC category were by far the most evenly spread. The nominees included heavy-hitters like Signalis, Citizen Sleeper, and NORCO, just to name a few, and while any one of them would have been a worthy winner in the eyes of the Destructoid team, Vampire Survivors is the PC title that came out on top this year.
Vampire Survivors is unassuming from first glance, especially to those …</span>

                              <span>No bones about it
Publisher Kitbox Games, in alliance with developer Sundae Month, has announced that the very silly but entirely wholesome title Pupperazzi will come wagging its tail on Nintendo Switch in early 2023, following from its release on PC and Xbox One back in January of this year.
Pupperazzi&#x27;s concept is utterly delightful in its simplicity: You are a budding social media hound (pun fully intended) who is searching for internet stardom via the medium of doggie photos. Camera in hand, the player simply strolls around towns, beaches, and cityscapes, getting snap-happy on any and all four-legged friends that cross their path. Build up a portfolio of the finest puppy pics online and then bask in the glory of upvotes and having your pics turned into NFTs (That last bit doesn&#x27;t happen).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0j_0yGFPSQo&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;KitfoxGames
Pupperazzi features a wide variety of Good Boys and Girls, including terriers, pugs, labradors, shibas, and so many more. And, when not taking great photos, you can pet your new doggie pals, play fetch, dress them up (if you&#x27;re terrible), arrange parties, and enjoy various other activities. Don&#x27;t forget to take them *checks notes* skateboarding. As you receive acclaim for your pupperazzi skills, you&#x27;ll also get the opportunity to upgrade your camera equipment — buying new filters, lenses, and effects. It&#x27;s all very charming and wholesome, and most certainly a stress-free way to unwind on a lazy afternoon.
Pupperazzi launches in early 2023 on Nintendo Switch. It is available now on PC and Xbox One.

A new survey rolled out by Xbox suggests that the publisher may be entertaining the idea of cheaper, ad-based tiers for its hugely successful game streaming subscription service, Xbox Game Pass.
The survey, which was noted by the eagle-eyed video game fans over on Resetera, looks to garner interest in some hypothetical new versions of the subscription service. One example offered is &quot;Xbox Game Pass Lite&quot;, which would offer access to the standard Game Pass library of new and classic games, but would play ads before each game launches, and would limit access to download only (so no streaming).

This suggested service would also include multiplayer access, with an example price of around five dollars. If such a service were to exist, it would almost …</span>

                              <span>The best part of Christmas: waiting for clogged servers!
It&#x27;s Christmas time, and that means it&#x27;s the season of giving...and getting! I assume some of you out there are gifting hardware to relatives or immediate family members, and with modern hardware comes a certain degree of responsibility. Yep, updates! This Reddit thread from Letmeplat reminded me of something really important: consider updating your hardware before you gift it.
Often times, Christmas day servers explode with demand
I think it was the 3DS era that I started thinking about updating gifts ahead of time. It had gotten to the point where nearly everything needed a hefty amount of firmware updates: on top of game updates. I think the worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had with this was updating my PS3 after a long hiatus. The PSN would take hours to download each update, and would turn around and download an update on top of that update. It was exhausting, and would just leave it running all day.
As an extra tip: if your console comes with a free game like Mario Kart, consider updating that too. Or as a matter of fact, consider updating any game you&#x27;re gifting. With few exceptions (like The Witcher 3 fitting on one Switch cart), many games require huge updates to even play, which could mean wait times, or bugged out servers preventing someone from downloading a crucial day one patch.
Of course, you could also leave it to the giftee to do it, especially if you&#x27;re aiming to give them a sealed copy. It&#x27;s your choice!

Mobile game giant King has announced that it is shutting service for its microtransaction-fuelled title Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! Originally launched in March of 2021 on iOS and Android platforms, Crash and pals will make their final dash in February 2023, when the servers are shut off permanently.
&quot;Crash fans, it’s with a heavy heart that we inform you on February 16, 2023 we will terminate service for Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!&quot; wrote King in a message on Facebook. &quot;It has meant so much to bring your favourite Crash characters to life and we&#x27;ve sincerely loved making this game. Thank you for spending your time with us and we hope you will join us in one of our many other games.&quot;

The in-game store is closed, effective immediately, and players are encouraged to use up any of the &quot;Purple Crystals&quot;, (On the Run&#x27;s in-game currency), before the closing date. The news has come as something of a surprise to some in the runner&#x27;s community, as there had been whispers that On the Run! might actually have been preparing for a full relaunch in the new year. The game had previously been delisted from stores, with the developer saying that the removal was due to a &quot;bug&quot;.
Dedicated fans of the title have also expressed dismay that a game they have spent money on over the past 23 months will suddenly be rendered completely unusable. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the risk that comes with frequent spending within modern service titles. Many, many mobile titles have pulled down the blinds on the player communities, regardless of whether the fans are financially invested, and refunds are rarely forthcoming, if ever.
Crash Bandicoot: On the Run! is not the first game to call it quits in the early going, and it absolutely will not be the last.

Early this morning, Capcom held its latest Capcom TV live stream, in which we got our first proper glimpse at some new Street Fighter 6 characters in action. Clumsily strutting their stuff for the home audience were newcomers Marisa, Manon, and J.P. who joined series veterans Dhalsim, Dee Jay, and E. Honda for some impromptu slugfests.
Now, without being mean, it must be said that these matches are hardly what you&#x27;d call &quot;deep dive character showcases&quot; — featuring a helluva lot of wild button mashing and endless jumping — but the matches do give us the opportunity to check out some of the incoming characters normals and specials, along with their respective intro animations, walkouts, win poses, and, perhaps most importantly of all, their &quot;Game Face&quot; options!

Note: This Cloud Version of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was tested on 100MB UW Broadband over WiFi and wired ethernet cable, along with a 5G mobile connection.

The launch of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard back in 2017 was a revelation for fans of the franchise.

Inti Creates&#x27; next project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, has a release date! Announced back in August, this stunning-looking side-scrolling platformer looks to blend the fast-paced run-and-gun action of Mega Man with the horror atmosphere and level design of Castlevania to the eShop on 23rd February 2023.
Grim Guardians is actually a spin-off of Inti&#x27;s Gal*Gun series, one of the developer&#x27;s most well-known franchises, and the game stars two of the series&#x27; heroines — Shinobu and Maya. You&#x27;ll be able to play the game alone or co-op with a friend, and you&#x27;ll need both characters&#x27; skills in order to get through the game.

The update is completely free and introduces the new Time-Attack Challenges to each of the game&#x27;s zones. This mode will see you taking on new Hornet characters in a race around tricky courses to win some bonus fashion items for the protagonist, Milo.

                              <span>Hundreds of thousands of pirating BitTorrent users have been sued over the years. These cases rarely ever make it all the way to trial but, in a Florida court, this is about to happen. Before the trial starts, however, several outstanding issues have to be decided, including the use of the term &quot;copyright troll&quot; before the jury.

                              <span>2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.
Announced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel&#x27;s 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. 


In a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. 
Risk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC. To learn more, check out our review for the original Risk of Rain here. Be sure to also visit our evolving list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>The tough-as-nails martial arts brawler Sifu is migrating to Xbox platforms and Steam sometime in March. Not only that, but the game is receiving a big content update free to all players.
This update is called Arenas, and as the name suggests, it adds nine new maps that feature combat challenges. Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits. Arenas also arrives in March and serves as the latest addition in a roadmap of seasonal post-launch updates that have bolstered the title with more cosmetics, cheats, difficulty settings, and even a replay editor. 


Sifu is now available on PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC via the Epic Game Store. You can read our review of the game here.</span>

Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise&#x27;s start. That&#x27;s why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month&#x27;s cover of Game Informer. 
Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game&#x27;s director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with &quot;island&quot; in its name is set in…</span>

The sequel to Star Wars: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, was announced some time ago, but developer Respawn Entertainment has remained mostly silent on what to expect. That changed earlier this month when a new gameplay trailer pulled the veil back on several new gameplay features, not to mention an impending March release date. We followed up with game director Stig Asmussen to learn more details about the anticipated title.
One of the most notable additions is the arrival of several new fighting stances for Cal Kestis as he goes into battle. “We have five fully realized stanc…</span>

It&#x27;s a first-person factory-building game set in an alien cavern complex with pretty bioluminescent plants. I am excited to lose dozens or hundreds of hours to it when it launches on early access.

                              <span>Riot Games are attempting to get out of a silly sponsorship deal they made last year with now defunct crypto exchange company FTX. The deal involved FTX paying many millions of dollars to League Of Legends developers Riot, who have only received $6.25 million of the $12.5 million FTX were supposed to cough up in 2022. This is on account of FTX being a) bankrupt and b) formerly lead by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested last week in The Bahamas. It is hard not to LoL.

                              <span>How was your year for PC hardware, reader? Pick up anything nice, or got any old favourite gear still going strong? I’m still very happy with the 4K gaming monitor I got for a pittance, and have spent the past twelve months becoming increasingly convinced that tenkeyless keyboards are, in fact, the best keyboards.


That’s just me, though. On an everyone’s-invited macro level, 2022 ended up being the most transformative year for PC gaming kit in recent memory. We’ve had it all: long overdue launches, bitter disappointments, and genuinely impactful performance innovations. Also, Valve made a handheld PC. That was cool.

It&#x27;s a thing with a free public beta you can play right now, and it&#x27;s a good enough thing to be worth the risk of your boss coming over to ask why your screen is full of gorgeous battling wizards and creatures rather than spreadsheets. 
Duelyst the first boasted a dead clever combination of card-battling and physical manoeuvring, a bit like Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns but better and multiplayer. I was sad when it died. This is by a different team of developers, and it&#x27;s more of a revival with a few tweaks than a true sequel. Who cares, I can play Duelyst again.

                              <span>I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).
The setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.

                              <span>Fortnite developer Epic Games is settling two complaints made to the US Federal Trade Commission by paying out a total of more than half a billion dollars. Wall Street Journal report that the FTC alleged Epic had violated protections intended to secure children’s privacy, and tactically drove players to make unintended purchases that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).


A federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers.

He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself.

                              <span>As fun as it is to declare something &quot;a tradition&quot; and blithely repeat it year after year to entertain myself, it has been quite magic to see other people anticipate and adopt the things I&#x27;ve declared RPS Christmas traditions. That&#x27;s all you need to form tradition: people who want to experience something together. No matter how slight or daft the thing is, what really matters is that we do it together. So please, reader dear, join me for an annual play of Skeal, a wonderful (and free) festive single-joke game.

They say the update to the update &quot;should improve the overall stability and performance&quot;, which will hopefully be especially good news for anyone trying to de-neck nekkers on an ageing graphics card.

Custom controller maker Super Louis 64’s done just that, crafting a Buster Sword that lets him play through Final Fantasy 7 Remake in true Cloud style. When he shared a clip of his antics on Twitter, Super Louis insisted the whole game is playable using the big knife. The honorary Soldier says he’s hoping to have a full video of his time spent pretending to be Cloud up on his YouTube channel today.

                              <span>Microsoft may be considering a lower-priced tier of their Game Pass service, with a few adjustments from the current standard options. A Spanish-language survey shared on ResetEra has allegedly shown the company asking current subscribers whether they’d be up for cheaper Game Pass for PC and console, if that reduction came with a delay for first-party games or running ads. It’s worth taking this with a heavy pinch of salt though, as there’s no confirmed source to the survey.

That’s today, if you’ve not checked your advent calendar yet. This one’s got my attention because I’m a sucker for a fishing minigame, something Sable added in a free update just last month. It’s also a relatively peaceful game to add to your pile ahead of the beckoning wintertide break, thanks to the complete lack of combat. John Lennon would be chuffed.

                              <span>With the great AMD 4th Gen EPYC Linux performance showing significant generational uplift and dominating against the current Xeon Scalable &quot;Ice Lake&quot; competition, it&#x27;s a combination of the twelve channels of DDR5 system memory support, up to 96 cores per socket, introduction of AVX-512, and other Zen 4 micro-architectural improvements. As follow-up testing articles to all of the Genoa data delivered thus far, over the weeks ahead I have additional benchmark results to share looking more closely at these different areas of improvement for AMD 4th Gen EPYC. In today&#x27;s article is a look at the EPYC 9654 2P performance with AVX-512 on/off while also looking at the CPU power consumption impact and the affect on CPU clock frequencies and thermals.</span>

                              <span>The year is coming to a close, which means it&#x27;s time to lock ourselves in a room and decide, unequivocally, what the best games of 2022 were and crown one ultimate champion. Will it be Elden Ring? Or maybe God of War Ragnarök? What about the impressive indie underdog, Neon White? We also liked Tunic quite a lot. We will be sharing our picks for the game and games of the year in the next issue of Game Informer magazine with [redacted] on the cover, but we also want to hear from our readers and share your favorites of 2022.
To do that, we ask that you fill out the poll below. Send us your personal list of 2022&#x27;s five best games and we will gather everyone&#x27;s information and share the result early. You have until the end of the day on January 19 to submit your list. We can&#x27;t wait to see how your picks compare to ours!</span>

                              <span>Square Enix announced its Final Fantasy pixel remasters of the series&#x27; first six games in June of last year, and over the course of roughly eight months, each of those remasters hit PC platforms. Fans have been waiting since that announcement for the reveal of console versions of these remasters and finally, Square Enix has revealed that all six are coming to PlayStation and Switch next year. 
More specifically, these pixel remasters will hit PlayStation 4 and Switch sometime in the spring of 2023. Each of these games can be purchased individually or together as a bundle, and a limited physical edition will also be available on the same day. Here&#x27;s a look at what to expect in the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster: FF 35th Anniversary Edition: 
Final Fantasy I-VI Collection - physical collection of all games for either PS4 or Nintendo Switch
Anniversary Edition goods box
A bonus lenticular sleeve for the game package
2-disc vinyl record set featuring newly arranged game music with exclusive cover artwork by Kazuko Shibuya
A specially compiled artbook showcasing beautiful character pixel art 
Eight stylized pixel art character figures in window packaging
This edition of the game is available exclusively on the Square Enix Store and its first batch is already sold out (although you can join a waiting list here)
The company says a &quot;small run of physical standard editions [of the collection] will also be available exclusively from the Square Enix Store from Spring 2023,&quot; but notes that quantities will be &quot;extremely limited&quot; so if you&#x27;re interested, you should preorder. 
For more information about each of these pixel remasters, head to Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. Check out our ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game to find out where Final Fantasy I-VI land on our list after that.

                              <span>The Knight Witch deserves more attention than it&#x27;s getting. It&#x27;s a Metroidvania shmup in which you fly about, blast enemies with guns, and cast spells from a deck of cards. For all the bang and zip of the combat, it&#x27;s also deeply cosy, with lush 2D art and sweet character relationships in an underground post-apocalyptic world that&#x27;s still somehow filled with plants, rustic cabins and cute market stalls. There&#x27;s a free demo to play now.

                              <span>I played hundreds of hours of Minecraft in the years after its original release, but hadn&#x27;t returned again until recently. It turns out the standalone expansion I needed was a son. He&#x27;s six years in development and today I introduced him to a private Minecraft multiplayer server for the first time. Exploring, building, and the vibes are all as wonderful as I remember.

                              <span>While some of my pals (and colleagues!) are now off for Christmas, the gits, we&#x27;re still officially here next week. Down a few people, sure, but doubtless filled with enough festivity to compensate. By Jove, I&#x27;ll stuff everyone full of festivity. But first, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>The Z-Library crackdown has resulted in some unusual takedown notices that have little to do with authors or publishers. Knockoff sites such as Zlibrary.to and Zlib.is appear to be most interested in protecting their newly gained popularity. At the same time, a publication that wrote about Z-Library alternatives is going after sites that copied its article.

                              <span>Valve have announced that the Steam Winter Sale will begin next week on December 22nd. I can already see myself standing in front of my mirror, chanting &quot;I do not need more games&quot; before sitting back down at my desk and splurging on everything I missed from this year&#x27;s RPS advent calendar. 
Valve have given us a peek at what&#x27;s going to be on sale, so click through to see what you should avoid buying until it starts.

You can jump into the frontier of Amazon Games vaguely piratical MMO without paying a penny this weekend, where you&#x27;re free to lark about until December 19th. Has the recent early game overhaul alleviated the opening grind? Perhaps!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t think of a better place for turn-based fights than in the margins of medieval manuscripts. There&#x27;s a wealth of weirdness to draw on, and Inkulinati seems admirably willing to dip its quill into messed-up cats and donkeys playing double-ended trumpets. We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for it, but we&#x27;ll only have to wait a little longer, as developers Yaza Games have just announced they&#x27;ll be launching on Steam Early Access on January 31st.
They&#x27;ve also sketched out a new demo to tide us over, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed my little poke at it.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t you just love Christmas? The music, the food, the laughter, the screams of elves getting shoved into boxes in a cold dark space mine. It&#x27;s the most magical time of the year, especially now that charming co-op shooter Deep Rock Galactic has launched its annual Yuletide Elf Hunt. It&#x27;s time to dress up your dwarves, grab your pickaxes, and get back to hauling rocks for an oppressive corporation. There&#x27;s double XP in it for you.

                              <span>As has seemingly become a yearly tradition in my gaming calendar, I have ended up finishing 2022 in much the same way I finished 2021: reviewing yet another Final Fantasy VII game. Last year, it was the PC release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this year it&#x27;s Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, a remaster of the original game&#x27;s PSP prequel. As such, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some &#x27;downtime&#x27; to &#x27;hang&#x27; with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. 
Drop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more.

Announced in a tweet today, it confirms previous rumours that Guerrilla were working on an online multiplayer Horizon game, and a recent batch of job listings for the project have given us a glimpse of what we might be able to expect once it&#x27;s ready.

                              <span>Two months after leaving early access, Vampire Survivors yesterday launched its first paid expansion. Its name is Legacy Of The Moonspell, and it adds a new map along with new characters and enemies and weapons, all inspired by Japanese folkore (including a variety of yokai and oni). For a mere £1.50, it is perfect. Do you like Vampire Survivors and want more? Buddy, it&#x27;s right here.

I&#x27;ll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;ll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going &quot;wheeee!&quot;.
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you&#x27;ll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you&#x27;ll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

                              <span>The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company&#x27;s long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it&#x27;s because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it&#x27;s been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

                              <span>When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren&#x27;t that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you&#x27;ll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I&#x27;ve concluded that my mind must&#x27;ve been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun&#x27;s verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you&#x27;ll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it&#x27;s a shame the FPS side can&#x27;t match it.

                              <span>Nothing beats the audio design of Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II. You know when you look at a light for too long and then close your eyes, and you see an imprint of the light against your retinas? The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not. As is the excellent &quot;EUURRYAAAARRGH!&quot; death-cry that protagonist Kyle Katarn makes as he takes one blaster bolt too many and collapses onto the ground.

                              <span>The Crucial P3 Plus is our best cheap PCIe 4.0 SSD for gaming, so I&#x27;m happy to report that the giant 2TB model is down to a modest £128 at Amazon UK. This isn&#x27;t the lowest price it&#x27;s ever been - it was £119 once before - but it is still an excellent price for a high performance PCIe 4.0 SSD and well below its £182 RRP.

It bills itself as the world&#x27;s smallest city builder, on account of your creations stretching across singular tiles that range from a tiddly 3x3 surface area to a mighty 15x15. 
It&#x27;s by developer Paul Schnepf, who made minimalist skateboarding game The Ramp and worked on the lovely yet much more goal-oriented Islanders. The Block is just about making something nice-lookin&#x27;. It&#x27;s out now, and cheap as chips.

                              <span>We all know that Hideo Kojima’s a big fan of the film industry, and that many of his games feature big Hollywood talent and have verged on movie-length cutscenes at times. I can’t say it’s a surprise, then, that Death Stranding, which just had its sequel confirmed at The Game Awards last week, is being adapted for film. Kojima Productions are working with production company Hammerstone Studios to bring the BB Boys&#x27; post-apocalyptic hiking trip to life.

                              <span>Remember the Steam controller? It was kind of like the Neanderthal to the Steam Deck’s Homo sapiens, existing for a brief few years before being discontinued back in 2019. Steam Controllers were an unusual evolutionary offshoot of the by-then fairly standardised controller layout, with funky clickable trackpads taking the place of thumbsticks. Well, Valve’s designers seem to be up for reviving the concept in some form. At least, that’s what they’ve told The Verge in an interview about the Steam Deck’s first nine months.

Metzen had retired back in 2016 after decades of working on Warcraft and Blizzard’s other games. The return was shared by Warcraft general manager Jon Hight in a statement posted to Twitter, which confirmed that Metzen will initially return to the company to work on the long-running World Of Warcraft. It’s expected that Metzen will follow that up by moving onto other connected projects.

Hollywood Reporter say that Henry Cavill, recently-dropped Superman and former Geralt Of Rivia, is involved as an executive producer and potential series lead. The rights to Warhammer 40K are reportedly hotly contested among the rival streaming services, with Amazon spending months negotiating the possible deal with Games Workshop.

                              <span>It’s well documented that creativity can help quell the waves of stormy mental health seas. Hours of documentaries chronicle how artists expressed their struggles through brushstrokes, or how an actor agonised over creating an accurate character to counterbalance their imposter syndrome or anxiety. It’s unlikely many creatives have found “refuge” in a 27 year old retro game engine - but that’s exactly how Dan Douglas talks about his sprawling mod for Duke Nukem 3D.

                              <span>Blizzard is now taking pre-orders on a large, nearly $100 special Diablo IV collector’s box which includes many things. But it doesn’t include the game. And while Blizzard isn’t trying to trick people into accidentally buying this game-free box, it still seems very odd that there’s not even an option to get the game…

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo&#x27;s achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash&#x27;s exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Fortnite is crossing over with another big anime. This time, the saviors of My Hero Academia join the fight. Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

In April, Crystal Dynamics revealed that it was developing the next Tomb Raider game in its series that began with a reboot back in 2013. They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel. 


&quot;Amazon Games and Crystal Dynamics today announced they have reached an agreement under which Crystal Dynamics will develop a new multiplatform Tomb Raider title, with Amazon Games providing full support and publishing the game globally,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The as-yet-untitled new Tomb Raider …</span>

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X. 
&quot;The game is an artistic combination of action, shooting, strategy, and puzzles,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;The PS VR2 headset and PS…</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

                              <span>More than half the rhythm games I see on PC seem to feature courses that look like bullet hell levels, designed for players with the perseverance, patience and 12-fingered hands I lack. Melatonin looks more my pace, with pastel hand-drawn art, chill beats, and levels about dreams and reality merging together. It&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>OK, this one is ridiculous. I get that. And yet - I&#x27;m posting it anyway. This is a deal on an 18TB hard drive from Amazon, a Seagate Exos X18 7200RPM CMR drive that will allow you to install all the games** or back up all the things**, or maybe both. This huge HDD has been reduced to £287, a historic low, which works out as 1.6p per gigabyte - absolutely crazy given the size we&#x27;re working with here. 
**Your mileage may vary, but if you are able to legitimately fill this I will be genuinely impressed.

                              <span>What better way to win back your community after the rocky launch of a new game than by providing a free &quot;upgrade&quot; to a beloved old game? I&#x27;ve no way of knowing if that&#x27;s what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month &quot;upgrading all copies&quot; of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC. 

If it was what they thought, it hasn&#x27;t worked. Players report that Re-Elected isn&#x27;t an upgrade at all, but that it has broken their save games, their mods, and introduced new launch and crash bugs to the nine-year-old game.

Well, since the Season 01 Reloaded update arrived, you now have the option to ask enemy players for help and get to join their team if they do. There’s a whole bunch more stuff in the update including the new version of the Shipment map for Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, which you take a look at in the video below.

                              <span>I have a confession to make. I’m not really feeling very Christmassy yet. There’s only a week and a bit to go before the day itself, and I’ve got all my decorations up and everything. I just haven’t found that festive groove. Cat-wrangling puzzler A Little To The Left has something in its Christmas sack that might spur on some kind of festive awakening though. Between December 22nd and 27th, A Little To The Left’s putting aside its Daily Tidy Delivery mode of randomly generated individual challenges to offer six holiday-themed messes for you to make spick and/or span.

                              <span>Futuristic co-op action game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide receives its first significant update today. Dubbed a &quot;content drop&quot;, you and your three grimdarkest pals can now take on the new Comms Plex map. Zealots and Ogryns are getting a new weapon each, too, both power mauls. The 1.0.20 patch lands alongside today’s update, bringing a long list of fixes and tweaks aimed at stabilising the game.

                              <span>If the recent God Of War games weren’t cinematic enough, streaming providers and general tessellators of cardboard boxes everywhere Amazon have greenlit a TV show based on Kratos’ adventures. The Hollywood Reporter, erm, reports that Wheel Of Time’s Rafe Judkins is showrunner on the project, backed up by writers and executive producers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Those two worked on The Expanse, and were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Children Of Men. No word on who will play the spartan goliath just yet, but the Clive Owen for Kratos campaign starts here.

You can watch Shen talk about Starfield’s factions, companions, and quests in the video below.

These sillies must be mistaken. Thankfully, after a couple of weeks with Lil Gator Game, I finally get it. All these people weren&#x27;t talking about the shoe, of course! They were talking about Lil Gator Game, which features the most loveable croc of all (please don&#x27;t lecture me on the difference between alligators and crocodiles, I love them both equally).

It doesn&#x27;t have the fast pace and stunning climax of Solitaire, y&#x27;know? So what if we jazz it up by smashing in another puzzle game. Like in Minesweeper Tetris, released for free on Steam this morning, which kinda adds Tetris by making the screen slowly fill in with fresh lines of mines, challenging you to clear mines quickly. It twists my melon, man.

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>In this special travel vlog, Game Informer&#x27;s Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea tour Super Nintendo World while visiting Osaka, Japan. The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed earlier this year that it was developing new TV shows based on Gran Turismo, Horizon, and God of War. At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below:

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

I say hippies, I mean bloodthirsty thugs who happen to like psychedelics. 
The update has also increased security for the popular Cayo Perico heist, which was one of the main ways people earned their money, so folks are understandably grumpy. Maybe they can sell some acid instead?

                              <span>Update: CDPR have released a PC hotfix that returns non-ray traced performance to its previous levels, with RT performance getting a boost as well. Hooray! Though it&#x27;s still quite stuttery and it appears AMD FSR is causing crashes. Less hooray! The original article, based on test results taken before the hotfix, continues below:

Earlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.

                              <span>Yee haw, buckle up, root and also toot, for the Devil&#x27;s Moon event has kicked off in Hunt Showdown. The event sees Crytek&#x27;s excellent multiplayer cowboy sneak &#x27;em up periodically set fire to big parts of each map, where you blow up creepy bleedy statues for points that unlock new weapons and traits. There&#x27;s one that makes you invisible to monsters, which sounds ridiculously powerful - which is probably why the traits will only be in play until the event ends on January 15th.

Patch 9 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate III is out now, adding playable Paladins and increasing the level cap to 5. In true D&amp;D spirit, that&#x27;s when you get the good stuff, like the ability to fly or summon zombies. Heck, I think you can summon zombies and make *them* fly. It&#x27;s a whole new world.
Come watch the developers natter all about it in a festive edition of one of their Panels From Hell. One of them is dressed up as a knitting reindeer, and they just announced critical role chap Matthew Mercer will voice a new character.

                              <span>Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath&#x27;s exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you&#x27;ve dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite sad that one of The Geoff Awards 2022 announcements I&#x27;m most excited about likely targeted me and no-one else. And that&#x27;s because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn&#x27;t show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I&#x27;d argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn&#x27;t a life investment, and that&#x27;s rad.

                              <span>Earlier this year I watched a very short presentation of Inkbound, an upcoming turn-based roguelike from Shiny Shoe, the devs behind deckbuilder Monster Train. I thought it had potential, but it&#x27;s difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you&#x27;ve got to go on is footage they&#x27;d prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I&#x27;m excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe&#x27;s CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game&#x27;s speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

                              <span>Aquatic open-world sci-fi fest Subnautica has hit 2.0 with its Living Large major update, bringing the game&#x27;s quality up to par with sequel Subnautica: Below Zero. The update brings across some snazzy construction parts from Below Zero, meaning you’re now free to trick out your bases with surface hatches and glass domes. Nice. It also sweeps away more than 800 bugs, including ones that affected base building, vehicle navigation, and piloting. Living Large adds an unstuck button to the menu too, in case you get into peril on some geometry below the waves and can’t free yourself.

                              <span>Earlier today, it was revealed that Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion has a piece of artwork in it with a great big Getty Images watermark slapped across it. The eagle-eyed staff over at Kotaku posted an image of the offending painting, found in Nibelheim&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion where Zack and co find themselves toward the end of the game, and having gone back in to see for myself, I can confirm that, yep, the in-game painting of John Crowther&#x27;s Ludgate Circus, London, 1881 does indeed still have the watermark on it. Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a&#x27;knockin... 
Whoopsie artwork isn&#x27;t the only thing hiding in Crisis Core&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion, though, because down in the basement is a rather cute nod a Final Fantasy VII fav. Spoilers within, obvs.

                              <span>Cinema owners say that Avatar: The Way of the Water will hit Russian screens this Christmas, despite Western sanctions. Exactly when is unclear but with backing from the Association of Theater Owners, it seems almost inevitable. Meanwhile, a draft law presented to the government envisions movies such as Avatar 2 being distributed all around Russia, without their owners&#x27; permission.

Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

                              <span>Six months ago MPA-Canada, ACE, and Rogers Media teamed up to shut down IPTV provider SmoothStreams in Canada. The lawsuit already lists 224 records but no trial is expected anytime soon, even if it gets that far. In the meantime, photos of the service&#x27;s servers and new details of the shutdown operation have appeared in a Federal Court order.

                              <span>Illegal streaming site PrimeWire avoided, dodged, or simply ignored Hollywood&#x27;s attempts to bring it down for at least a decade. A copyright lawsuit filed by the studios in 2021 was a clear sign that patience had finally run out and a year later, it&#x27;s all over. A California court has just awarded the plaintiffs $20.7m in damages plus $417,600 to cover attorneys&#x27; fees.

Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series. After roughly two hours of playing Odyssey, I am rearing to jump back into the anime, and that’s the best compliment I can give the game. It doesn’t hurt that Odyssey is shaping u…</span>

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey. 
On paper, it’s precisely the type of RPG I like to spend my time playing. After going hands-on for a few hour…</span>

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

Final Fantasy 16 will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for six months.</span>

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>This evening’s presentation of The Game Awards brought us a new cinematic look at Diablo IV. The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco Studios, Bandai Namco Online, and Amazon Games are teaming up to release Blue Protocol, an upcoming MMO action RPG with anime visuals to more territories and platforms, including North America.
Blue Protocol was not announced during the 2022 Game Awards, but up until now, it hasn&#x27;t been clear if the game would be making its way outside of Japan. During the show, a new trailer for the game was shared, alongside a confirmation that the game would be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in new regions the second half of 2023. Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
