                              <span>In LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, as you perform everyday tasks such as robbing banks and diving into vaults for money, you may notice a sack of cash on a money cart. While it may not seem useful, it&#x27;s important if you pursue the role of one of Brick Bay&#x27;s bankers.


How to get a Sack o&#x27; Cash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


LEGO Fortnite Brick Life offers two main ways to get sacks of cash, known in-game as a sack o&#x27; cash:



Take a sack from the ATMs outside of Vaulted Value Propositions.


Break into Vaulted Value Propositions&#x27; vault and claim it from the money cart.



Both options require getting into the Vaulted Value Propositions bank and taking the sack of cash alongside some money. The first option gives you 50 coins and the sack, while the vault version grants you 500 cash, making it a b…</span>

                              <span>As a resident of Brick Life, you must do your part by keeping the city clean. This requires you to take out the trash every once in a while, whether for tasks or to simply make it nice and tidy. Here&#x27;s how to clean trash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.


How to clean trash or throw something out in Brick Life


You may have trouble finding litter when you begin the &#x27;Clean Trash or Throw Something Out&#x27; task in Brick Life. I ran into this issue initially, especially since waste will be pretty hidden. The main thing you need to look for is trash cans that have a bag on top of it. Their locations will be randomized, but I&#x27;ve had the most luck finding them near Durr Burger.

The Durr Burger Line Cook job features a trash-based mission, which is likely why the litter frequently appears there. You can try other locations to see if waste pops up. However, remember that trash cans without bags have already been cleaned, so there&#x27;s no need to interact with them.


If you haven&#x27;t found a suitable trash can, you can choose the second option: throwing something out. Grab anything you don&#x27;t need, like a piece of paper or a ticket. You can collect plenty of items around town, making this objective much more manageable. Then, approach any trash area to throw it out.

Upon successfully completing the Clean Trash task in Brick Life, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with 500 cash in your pocket. This is just one of the many ways to earn money in the game, besides the ATM and job objectives. Use your hard-earned cash to upgrade your home lots or get a Hoverboard.

Where to find the Sacrificial Heart


The entirety of this quest takes place in Act 3 on both Normal and Cruel difficulties in PoE2, specifically in the drowned city called Aggorat. Once there, start killing any enemies you come across, as each one on this map specifically has a chance of dropping the Sacrificial Heart. When dropped, the item will show up with bright green text, so it should be easy to spot and pick up. There&#x27;s not a specific enemy that drops it, howeve…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, of course, but when I play Skyrim, I seldom stop to admire the wildlife that frolics throughout this cold slice of Tamriel anymore. I think I&#x27;ve just played the game so much that I&#x27;ve gradually become numb to any visual allure. But with the power of modding, I can learn to truly appreciate TES5 once more.


Thanks to Nexus Mods user shadowman2777, I can now sleep with a cow. No, no. Not like that. Please try to focus here. I mean, &quot;Sleep With Any Cow Shout&quot; is a way of chilling with a fellow bovine creature while out and about in Skyrim.


Image via shadowman2777 / Nexus Mods.


If you just want to kick back with a furry wild beast (again, drag your mind out of the gutter), you can employ this custom Shout, which will allow you to cuddle up to any cow you target. Why would you want to do this? Why are you being so judgmental, is my rebuttal.


Fus-Cow-Dah!


Seriously, look how chilled out the guy in the image above looks, craning his neck to feel rested against the animal&#x27;s stomach. Ignore the well-endowed woman in the neon pink cocktail dress who&#x27;s standing nearby. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s not related to the mod.


Oh, there is one thing I should probably say. While, yes, there are cows in Skyrim, they don&#x27;t appear like the ones in the images shared by shadowman2777 on Nexus. This is because – according to the description – this mod seems to require another download: &quot;FNIS Creatures.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure if this is for the animations or these particular types of cows. In any case, if you need it, you can download if from here.


By now, you should all have enough Skyrim mods installed to make the aging RPG look like a different game entirely. No, but seriously, if Bethesda doesn&#x27;t let us mod The Elder Scrolls 6 by improving the visuals, adding custom quests, or changing the names of the Frost Trolls to Tim Allen for some reason, what even is the point?

                              <span>Former Blizzard head Mike Ybarra has lent his voice to the argument that Marvel Rivals is little more than a copy of Overwatch 2. The two games are hero shooters, feature a large base of playable characters, and share some gameplay similarities.


But Ybarra pointed to Marvel’s Black Widow and her similarities to Overwatch 2’s Widowmaker. Gamers have been quick to point out that Black Widow first featured in Marvel comics more than 50 years ago, while even her appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe predates the original Overwatch’s launch by more than five years. Other critics have also likened aspects of the latest Marvel title with that of Blizzard’s hero shooter.


The Overwatch success story


The original Overwatch, from Blizzard Entertainment, launched in 2016 as a hero shooter.…</span>

When you next log into your platform of choice, you&#x27;ll notice that Phasmophobia has begun updating. This is the Christmas patch – referred to as &quot;Winter&#x27;s Jest&quot; – which, as with all of these types of updates, comes with some themed content, as well as a promise that &quot;Karmpus waits.&quot;




In this case, the developer is taking cues from the Blood Moon event we had just a few weeks ago to challenge players. This event will continue until December 31, 2024, and is available on the PC and console ports of Phasmo…</span>

How to earn more Ascendancy Skill Points in Path of Exile 2


To earn your first four Ascendancy Points, all you needed to do was complete one full round of the Trial of Sekhamas and the Trial of Chaos. This was likely done during the first playthrough of your campaign, and each one rewarded you with two points, giving you a solid foothold in your Ascendancy progression.


The final four points, however, are a bit more elusive and demand a greater level of effort to get. They’re not handed out easily, but with some persistence, a bit of strategy, a…</span>

18. Wolverine

For as much as it hurts me to say, Wolverine is not the best in what he does in Marvel Rivals, as his lack of movement speed and in-combat mobility makes him an easy target to pick up, no matter if you are using a ranged or close-range focused hero. His passive also hurts more than it helps, as even if under the effect of Undyi…</span>

                              <span>When riding around LEGO Fortnite Brick Life&#x27;s city in style, your best options are cars or hoverboards. While you can certainly use a taco or ice cream truck, there&#x27;s something satisfying about hovering on a skateboard or sports car from point A to B.


Where to buy a Hoverboard in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


Purchasing a hoverboard in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life requires opening your phone, heading into the Vehicles menu, and going into the app&#x27;s shopping menu. While your list of cars is in the cardboard box section, the shop is shown with a shopping cart icon, with the hoverboard listed for 3,000 cash.


Screenshot by Destructoid


In short, while it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to other vehicles in the shopping menu, it&#x27;s still pricier than home furniture. You&#x27;ll need to work a few jobs or hop into the bank vault real quick to make some quick cash before making your next car purchase.


Once you purchase the hoverboard, it&#x27;ll be available to use anytime through the cardboard box section of your vehicles menu. Fortunately, if you log out of Brick Life, you&#x27;ll have to respawn it, but it won&#x27;t disappear forever. 


Similarly, if Epic Games introduces more hoverboards in future updates, you&#x27;ll be able to find those in the same menus. While the prices may differ, their functionality will likely remain the same.


is the Hoverboard faster than cars?


Overall, the hoverboard isn&#x27;t much faster than your default Style Utility Vehicle or other cars of similar size and speed. After driving both for about 30 seconds, I found they traveled similar distances, with the Style Utility car being a few seconds quicker for short distances. 


If you&#x27;re looking for significant speed increases, the hoverboard isn&#x27;t for you. It does look cool, though, so you&#x27;ll at least look stylish while cruising around Brick Bay.

To have a decent late-game build, you&#x27;ll need to unlock buffs and boosts along the way, as they will amplify the base damage with several modifiers. Applying buffs can happen in different ways, but the ones that unlock with the campaign should be prioritized. Doing so helps you get the boosts and unlock plenty of useful loot, including Uniques.

You can come across the permanent stats boosts in all three acts. Let&#x27;s look at all the available options, and how to unlock them in the first place.

Although you can change it later, your first choice is still important, especially if you plan to decorate your house later.


How to build a house in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


Before building your first LEGO Fortnite Brick Life house, you&#x27;ll need to find an empty lot anywhere in the city. You&#x27;ll find these by looking out for red and white signs with a yellow glow in front of a massive empty plot of land.

While the news will undoubtedly sound good to those familiar with the state of Destiny 2, it&#x27;s avoidable not to note that this seems like a reactionary move from the studio after Episode: Revenant was haunted by bugs and missteps, likely a result of the studio&#x27;s diminished staff.


While the zombie Scorn army theme behind Episode: Revenant is superb, the content has been rife with issues. Destiny 2 doesn&#x27;t have a reputation for being squeaky clean, but issues like Weightgate, Tonicgate, and the most recent slew of Dawning issues have left…</span>

As part of the annual ritual, Epic is going to be giving away plenty of video games for free. If the rumors are to be believed, 16 games will be part of the giveaways. The first title can already be redeemed, and it&#x27;s yours to keep permanently. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can unlock the games and add them to their Epic Games Store library.


How to get free games during Epic Games Store Holiday Sale 2024


The process of adding the games to your library is pretty simple. If you&#x27;ve done it in the past, you&#x27;ll be aware of the steps. If you&#x27;re new, just complete the following steps.



Login to your Epic Games Store account. You can do this on the PC app or on the website.


Once logged in, check the home screen. You&#x27;ll find the free games on offer by scrolling down. Alternatively, you can search for the title, and it will show up.


You&#x27;ll want to add it to your cart and then confirm your purchase.


There will be a final prompt, and once the purchase is complete, the game will be yours to keep.



If you bought the title outside of Epic Games Store Holiday Sale 2024, it will cost you a certain amount. As long as you complete the above-mentioned steps during the sale, it won&#x27;t cost you anything.

                              <span>Fairy Tail first became serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine way back in 2006, and over the last 18 years, there have been 63 volumes of the original manga totaling 545 chapters, 328 episodes of the anime, nine OVAs, two fully fledged movies, and additional spin-offs. That’s a lot of lore to sift through. 


In total, discounting the hours it would take to get through all 63 volumes of the manga, that’s way over 100 hours of watch time. We all lead busy lives, and finding 100 extra hours to watch Fairy Tail from start to finish is a big ask, so it’s understandable if you’d rather watch the main arcs and avoid all of the optional filler.

LEGO Fortnite Brick Life lets you drive cars, hoverboards, and even taco trucks, but you&#x27;ll have to unlock the first. Fortunately, driving around isn&#x27;t too difficult if you have the cash to buy a vehicle.


How to spawn a car in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


You&#x27;ll find your first car, the Style Utility Vehicle, by opening your phone, selecting the Vehicles menu, and spawning it in. You get one free car to drive around in, with more available through the vehicle shop menu.

Alexey Pajitnov, the game designer and programmer who created Tetris back in 1984, unexpectedly appeared in this endearing video that Nintendo posted on its official social media accounts. In it, he explains that 2024 marked the 40th anniversary of his creation and, to celebrate, two great versions of it are now available on Nintendo&#x27;s online service.

It’s easy to spend hours gathering up bait and heading to the water to try and gather up all of the available fish in any game. As a completionist, nothing brings me more joy than ticking off everything on a list, and thankfully, Luma Island doesn’t have a very long fish list.

There are two factions in GHOUL://RE: Humans (CCG) and Ghouls. When you first start your game, you&#x27;ll be randomly assigned to one of the two factions. You can pay some Robux to change your faction, or you can wait for Delirum (the perma-death mode which happens every hour), die during the event, and then, hopefully, get reborn as the other faction.

                              <span>One of the best money-makers in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life is entering the bank&#x27;s vault and stealing some cash. Although you won&#x27;t be able to make millions of this right away, you can easily make several thousand an hour just by picking up a few items. 


How to find the bank in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


Your first goal is to find the bank, known in-game as Vaulted Value Propositions. You&#x27;ll find it on the northern part of Brick Bay near RoboRoll Sushi and Meowswole&#x27;s Gym. You can drive here with a car or hoverboard or run here on foot if you&#x27;re nearby.

You&#x27;ll find the vault in the bank&#x27;s basement. You can also pick up the banker or security guard jobs if you want to fight against those trying to steal money. Otherwise, you can run in without much issue, and there&#x27;s no penalty for trying to take some cash from the vault.


How to enter the bank vault in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life


Entering the vault requires entering garbage chutes around the bank. You&#x27;ll find several of these in the building, including upstairs in Midas&#x27; room with the Security System hacking terminal. You can also find a safe in this room if you want to pick up a gemstone before diving into the vault.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Upon entering the chute, your character will jump down and teleport into the vault, giving you full access to the bank&#x27;s riches. In this room, you&#x27;ll see a cart full of cash and gold bars, which you can interact with to grab $500 and a sack of cash.

                              <span>The Early Access launch of Path of Exile 2 – a sequel that&#x27;s been several years in the making – has been met with a pretty fantastic reception. As well as a review score of &quot;Very Positive&quot; on Steam, Grinding Gears&#x27; newest action RPG also pulled in over half a million players in just a couple of days.


So far so good, it seems. Although, it&#x27;s not even been a week yet. It&#x27;s very much early days, still. Much work needs to be done, and no time like the present, as the developer has sent out the first major patch for the game.




Version 0.1.0d of Path of Exile 2 has started rolling out, and comes shortly after GGG announced it had initiated some QOL changes to the game, with promises that more would be on the way, along with the full patch notes. Well, today is that day, and the update comes…</span>

                              <span>If one thing&#x27;s certain, Astro Bot has been the gift that keeps on giving. Since launch, the GOTY-nominated platformer has received various levels and additional bots to collect for free. And it&#x27;s not done. Today, Astro Bot gets a free Winter Wonder update with a new map and more bots. 


As you should expect, the winter-themed level is coated with snow and sparkling with festive accouterments. The level features a massive Christmas tree with the expected robot face, and gilded presents can be found throughout. Astro Bot glides into the frosty level accompanied by a sleigh pulled by robotic reindeer. It really gets you into the holiday spirit, right? Thankfully, it won&#x27;t match the challenge of the speedrunning levels.

                              <span>Hi! Ive been playing and getting into Pokemon cards with some friends and thought it would be hilarious if I made/bought a deck where the only pokemon were Pikachu and Pikachu variations. Any help would be very appreciated.

Notes:

The price should hopefully be 30-40$ (sleeves included)</span>

In the four years that have followed between that Kickstarter launch and this Switch release, something appears to have been lost along the way.
Rather than the Kickstarter trailer’s segmented rollercoaster-like tracks, which immediately conjured up memories of Seger&#x27;s brilliant arcade racer Power Drift, instead the tracks in Victory Heat Rally look a lot more like the typical 3D environments expected from a modern racing game, albeit with cel shading designed to deliberately make them look more basic.

The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask joins other N64 classics Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Perfect Dark, and Banjo-Kazooie in being 100% decompiled (via ReCollect64).
Handled by the same that worked on the Ocarina of Time decompilation project — ZeldaRET — this project kicked off back in March 2021, and it&#x27;s taken over three and a half years to get the output to match the ROM source 1:1.

Well, this is becoming something of a trend, isn&#x27;t it? After retaking the throne last week, Super Mario Party Jamboree has stuck around at the top of the Japanese charts in Famitsu&#x27;s latest look.
In fact, the top three are unchanged this week, with Jamboree, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe all maintaining their spots on the podium. Echoes of Wisdom has popped back into the top 10 this time around, which is always nice to see, and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership has moved up a spot to land in fifth.

                              <span>What is it with you hero types? Always the same line.
Being from the UK, the name &#x27;Rita&#x27; never quite sat right with us for Power Rangers. It sounds too much like Rita from down the chip shop, who might ask if you want salt and vinegar with that; or Rita from round the corner, who may or may not be a juvenile delinquent wearing altogether too much makeup. That said, Rita, the witch-like antagonist of the Power Rangers team, definitely doesn’t work in the chip shop. Too much makeup on the other hand…
Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind is a brand new belt-scrolling beat &#x27;em up from Digital Eclipse, a developer better known for their retro remasters and collections in the form of Atari 50 and the recent Tetris Forever. Based on the original &#x27;90s incarnation of the show — a Japanese-American co-production that mish-mashed Japan’s Super Sentai action scenes with US-filmed actors — Power Rangers is a logical candidate to join the 2D scrolling beat-&#x27;em-up renaissance.

Well, folks, Geoff Keighley is back once again with another round of The Game Awards.
This year&#x27;s event marks the 10th Anniversary of The Game Awards, so we&#x27;re expecting some big surprises (not necessarily game announcements, mind) and spectacular celebrations. Naturally, with a boatload of sponsored ads sprinkled in, for good measure.

In some surprising news, the excellent Sonic-style platformer Freedom Planet 2 will be getting a Limited Run Games physical release for the Switch.
This game originally launched on the eShop earlier this year and received a 9 out of 10 from us here at Nintendo Life. The physical launch will include a standard edition for $39.99 USD (or your regional equivalent) and a deluxe edition for $69.99 USD.

The Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP developer Dragami Games has not only continued to address various issues with multiple patches but it&#x27;s also adding additional content to the game.
With this in mind, Dragami Games company CEO Yoshima Yasuda has now announced the team will be adding a photo mode &quot;soon&quot;. Nothing else was detailed, but typically these modes allow you to take shots of the main character and sometimes even change the outfits and camera settings.

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s &quot;embarrassing&quot; shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.

                              <span>At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it&#x27;s a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it&#x27;s specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman&#x27;s back. I understand why it&#x27;s supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don&#x27;t.

                              <span>After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

                              <span>In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That&#x27;s a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (&quot;The goal is to do everything, right?&quot;). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it&#x27;s ever been.

                              <span>If Space Marine 2&#x27;s wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends &quot;inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore&quot;. Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve&#x27;s new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it&#x27;s only going to be an option - not the new default.

                              <span>Astro Bot, one of the best games released in 2024, is getting a new snowy, holiday-themed level as part of a free update for the PlayStation 5 platformer.

                              <span>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don&#x27;t even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can&#x27;t be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it&#x27;s your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it&#x27;s time to play Skeal.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It&#x27;s a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There&#x27;s an explanatory video below.

                              <span>One of video game&#x27;s greatest pleasures is being able to shoot bits off an enemy and then append them to yourself. TankHead gets it. It&#x27;s about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.

It&#x27;s been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream. It was also released during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from the Epic Games Store now.

                              <span>Back when I played Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest, I fought a cave-dwelling boss who summoned hordes of grotty subterranean wildlife to swamp me. Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

Now, you get a squadron of tiny automata with drills for noses that burrow through your battle lines and utterly wreck your vulnerable missile launchers.

                              <span>First covered by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2017, Short Trip was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it&#x27;s out on Steam. Not only that, it&#x27;s arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added &quot;scheduled mode&quot; that adds more charm to an already lovely game.

                              <span>Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

Provided you don’t mind it being in someone else’s first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original Steam Deck, &quot;certified&quot; Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then put back on the market at steep discounts. You’re looking at £389/$439 for the 512GB spec and £459/$519 for 1TB, down from £479/$549 and £569/$649 respectively.

                              <span>I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.

                              <span>While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say &quot;his own choomba shot him!&quot; for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it&#x27;s ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

But even for platforms without that where ACPI CPUFreq remains the default, the Linux 6.13 kernel is still showing some nice incremental uplift at large on these new AMD server processors. Here are some Linux 6.11 vs. 6.12 vs. 6.13 Git kernel benchmarks using an AMD EPYC 9575F 64-core server.</span>

Here&#x27;s the thing about The Thing: Remastered; it&#x27;s still very much 2002&#x27;s The Thing. Which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how much you like your The Thing.

Ratalaika Games is bringing SEEP&#x27;s 8-bit platformer Ninja 1987 to Switch this Friday, 13th December 2024.
Besides the NES-style visuals, the inspiration for this one is pretty clear — it&#x27;s a tribute to Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, and other retro ninja platformers of the &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s

The Plucky Squire was one of our most anticipated releases of 2024, and while we were utterly charmed with the game when it launched, the Switch version in particular had a few rough edges. And one of the biggest complaints others had with the game was the amount of times the game took control away from the player, providing them with a bit too much guidance.

Publisher and developer HiWarp initially announced that the gorgeous aquatic adventure Naiad would flow onto Switch in 2022. That, obviously, never happened, but after a further two years of waiting, last night&#x27;s Wholesome Snack showcase finally delivered.
Naiad&#x27;s appearance in the presentation was enough of a surprise, but the dev had even more magic in store as it announced that it was shadow-dropping onto the Switch eShop there and then! That&#x27;s right, those in North America can pick this one up right now for $17.99.

The Super Mario Bros. Super Show is certainly unique. The animated show, which aired back in 1989, opened with live action segments starring Captain Lou Albano and Danny Wells as Mario and Luigi, respectively, with the bros. getting into some strange situations.
But did you know that the Korean version of the show is pretty different? It sure is, and we were reminded of its existence thanks to PrinceWatercress resharing clips on Bluesky.

The Pokémon Company has just casually announced that it&#x27;s working with Aardman Animation, the legendary British animation studio known for creating Wallace &amp; Gromit.
The project doesn&#x27;t have a name yet — and we imagine it&#x27;s a movie, TV short, or a series — but we&#x27;ll have to wait a while to see it, as it&#x27;s landing in 2027. Yes, 2027.

                              <span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a lot of fun. The new game from MachineGames and Bethesda lets you step into the (I assume very muddy and warm) boots of the famous adventurer for an exciting new journey around the world.

                              <span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is not what I was expecting. My expectation and fear was that developer MachineGames’ AAA action-adventure adaptation of the popular franchise starring Harrison Ford would play mostly like Uncharted, but in the ‘30s and with more Nazis. Thankfully, Great Circle is nothing like Tomb…

Animal Crossingbut.

These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here&#x27;s the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn&#x27;t make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you&#x27;re building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can&#x27;t be good for noise pollution.

                              <span>Duck Detective&#x27;s first case was The Secret Salami, which paired its cosy mystery about stolen lunches with a protagonist whose divorce and destitution were played entirely straight despite his being a duck. The results were seemingly delightful, and here comes a sequel.

Duck Detective: The Ghost Of Glamping will offer a further 2-3 hours of mystery-solving and is aiming for release in 2025.

                              <span>Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It&#x27;s currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it&#x27;s free-to-play with the usual comet&#x27;s tail of microtransactables 2) it&#x27;s third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I&#x27;m not going to share pictures. You&#x27;ll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You&#x27;re more interested in hearing how they&#x27;re patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here&#x27;s what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

                              <span>I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it&#x27;s an appalling bait-and-switch. It&#x27;s like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It&#x27;s like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don&#x27;t want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a &quot;true&quot; 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it&#x27;s nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they&#x27;re threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

If you think that&#x27;s a desperately cavalier and confusing way to run a news section, I can only suggest that you email a complaint to our news editor. Spoilers: our news editor is me, and I have already thrown your complaint in the bin. Mate, I don&#x27;t tell you how to do your job, but I&#x27;d be more than happy to, if you let me know what it is. Anyway, what were we talking about. Oh yeah, skiiing!

                              <span>London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

                              <span>Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and Star Citizen committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, somehow, conjure a big story from the crevices. It&#x27;s basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet&#x27;s most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a &quot;bogus&quot; phishing report, sent by &quot;AI-powered&quot; brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here&#x27;s a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

                              <span>I’ve got a strange relationship with the stealth sandbox murderbox that is Hitman: World of Assassination. If you were to ask me to list my favourite games, the latest Hitman trilogy would be in the top five, no question. And yet, I must have gotten intimidated at some point with the amount of new updates and all the spiffy unlockable suits I was missing out on, and just haven’t touched it in a couple of years now. Is the appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the game’s newest elusive target enough to reel me back in? I&#x27;m not sure, but I will say that I doubt Sean Bean can stretch his legs like that, even with the legendary flexibility offered by O2&#x27;s famously variable plans. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of Cyberpunk 2077’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.
I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.

                              <span>I’m quite smitten by the Nintendo DS stylings and traditional roguelike charms of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island, but I’m having real trouble summoning up the motivation to repeatedly grind through its opening levels to get to the interesting stuff. Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

Musi is seeking a preliminary injunction to reinstate its app while the legal battle plays out.

The Death Generator offers a gallery full of (mostly) retro games and a simple text box that will replicate the exact font used by those games, all so you can make the little shopkeeper in Zelda say rude words, or entirely rewrite the pre-mission dossiers of Goldeneye 007. There&#x27;s a lot more than that though. I&#x27;ve done a bunch, come see what I mean and have a go yourself.

                              <span>The big question a Tekken player always wants to know is: which DLC character is coming next? Well, you&#x27;ll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley&#x27;s winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they&#x27;ve just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not just because he&#x27;s a Nazi. It&#x27;s because he&#x27;s a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there&#x27;s something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you&#x27;ve probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.

                              <span>The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. &quot;It’s fine&quot;, I decided. &quot;It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of&quot;. Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. &quot;If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.&quot;
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

                              <span>“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

                              <span>Hello reader who is also a reader, and welcome back to Booked For The Week - our regular Sunday chat with a selection of cool industry folks about books! Everyone knows about ‘hardback’ and ‘softback’ books, but have you heard of the quickly discontinued ‘rice puddingback’? While hiring so many rice grain artists to transpose the blurbs in beautiful calligraphy made for an impressive spectacle, they were eventually banned after several fatal train slippage and/or smellage incidents. Ah well!  This week, it’s Charlene Putney, who’s been writing for games for over ten years, including bits for Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, NUTS, and Saltsea Chronicles! Cheers Charlene! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

The news warrants an informed conversation about creators&#x27; rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped &quot;propaganda&quot; and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

                              <span>I had a few merry evenings playing Escape Simulator back in 2022. Of the co-op escape room games I&#x27;ve played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.

Escape Simulator 2 will explore &quot;darker escape room themes&quot;, looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

Late or not, I can&#x27;t let it pass unremarked upon: Caves Of Qud, the vast, weird roguelike which has been in development for 17 years, hit version 1.0. It brings multiple endings to the game, a revised UI, improved tutorials and much more.

Or plant some C4 on the ceiling and go up and over. Or I think that&#x27;s a load-bearing pillar over there - may as well just bring down the entire advent calendar to find out what&#x27;s behind today&#x27;s door.

Wear gloves, huff on them, sit on them, give a fluffy cat a good squeeze. I personally like to clasp a mug of almost-too-hot coffee while I gaze at my Steam library wondering where the hours have gone. To each their own.

The subpoena seeks to identify the owner of a Bitcoin wallet, who is believed to be a European resident.

                              <span>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains &quot;over 400 cards and a playmat&quot; for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

                              <span>Where were you during the Summer of Doronko Wanko? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

And yet here we are, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle loving its ray tracing so much that the effects can’t ever be fully switched off.

                              <span>Every fascist in this game has a cold. The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games&#x27; clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it&#x27;s a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch &#x27;em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they&#x27;re both still Indiana Jones.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

                              <span>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

                              <span>Nightdive, you done good. The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.
I’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.

                              <span>Dogubomb’s Blue Prince boasts my favourite shapeshifting house in a video game, which admittedly isn’t setting a very high bar. Perhaps surprisingly, most video game houses do not shapeshift. Despite being made out of pure imagination and carbon emissions, they remain nostalgically shackled to the limitations of brick, mortar and Euclidean geometry. Blue Prince’s abode is different. It is a house made of house. You’ll actually design the layout yourself every time you wander through it, picking from a selection of mismatched room types whenever you open a door.

                              <span>There was a crowded second there when I read the press release and thought they’d militarised the Beano, but Menace is not, in fact, about Dennis the Menace joining the Colonial Marines. It’s the new turn-based tactics RPG from the creators of Battle Brothers, and look at that, it has a freshly deployed gameplay trailer.

                              <span>Covering announcement shows mean saving oneself for huge reveals, and since I might be the only person in the world right now this excited for FPS Mekkablood: Quarry Assault, I wondered if it might be better to hold off until a less pressing time. And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it&#x27;s been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!

                              <span>Anyone who is not trying to sell your something will tell you that ‘punk’ is a mostly meaningless term, mainly popularised by Malcolm McLaren and Vivian Westwood so they could sell bondage gear to teenagers. It is, of course, very punk of me to recognise this. However, this hasn’t stopped every other videogame released in the last 74 years trying to coin their own punk subgenre. The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’. Abyssus looks cool, and so with the power vested in me by the Greggs vegan sausage roll I had for lunch today, I hereby declare that this is the last game allowed to do this. Let’s see if it’s making the most of it, at least.

                              <span>Ah, it feels just like yesterday when Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector had around a year of development time left. Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent RPGs isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.

                              <span>“So, you’ve fallen off a mountain,” strikes me as a brilliant book to write and then stock in every mountainside gift shop across the land, purely for the image of a falling climber rapidly scanning the pages as they tumble comically to their doom, searching for the one piece of sage advice that might alleviate their predicament. If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.
Cairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it&#x27;s very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.

Created once again by Digital Sun, whose recent works include the excellent Cataclismo, it’s prettier and vaster, with expanded merchanting and deeper dungeoneering. It&#x27;s out sometime in 2025.

                              <span>One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It&#x27;s the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed &quot;Queen&quot; of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It&#x27;s playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I&#x27;m reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who&#x27;s just moved to an old &quot;danchi&quot; housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

                              <span>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by Final Fantasy dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, Fantasian was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit&#x27;s exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the RPG for us PC heads, calling it Fantasian Neo Dimension. It&#x27;s actually out today, too, if you&#x27;re interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.

                              <span>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I&#x27;ll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I&#x27;m here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll come out and say it: I had no idea, really, what Infinity Nikki was about before I dove in. I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I&#x27;d just missed the really big part - the fact it&#x27;s a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki&#x27;s gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won&#x27;t be logging back in ever again.

Taiwan&#x27;s Criminal Police Bureau recently busted three individuals promoting unlock instructions for these apps to roughly 400,000 users.  Surprisingly, this tech-savvy scheme was orchestrated by a group whose combined age totals 215 years.

While these conversions don&#x27;t knowingly violate any law, Spanish music industry group Promusicae reportedly labeled the service an audio download tool. In response, Google removed the URL from its search engine and banned the associated AdSense account.  However, after the MP3 site involved its lawyer, Google reversed its decision.

                              <span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard won&#x27;t receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is Dragon Age going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won&#x27;t necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual &quot;reinvention&quot;.

                              <span>Astrometica is Subnautica in space and to developer BeryMery&#x27;s credit, the game makes zero effort to hide this. It&#x27;s right there in the dog Latin of the title. It&#x27;s got Subnautica&#x27;s premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry. It&#x27;s got Subnautica&#x27;s core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.

In what feels almost like a pivot away from the developers&#x27; previous, magnificently hipster experiments, it&#x27;s billed as &quot;satisfyingly finite, immediately legible, entertaining, funny, and generally satisfying for a broad audience&quot;.

                              <span>&quot;Bestest best?! We’ll have that!&quot; is how I imagine detective immersive sim Shadows Of Doubt made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. &quot;RPS have never steered us wrong before!&quot; they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you&#x27;ve had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy&#x27;s hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you&#x27;ll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you&#x27;ll need something even juicier.

Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are &quot;transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft.&quot;

                              <span>When I downloaded Creeper World IXE&#x27;s demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a &quot;failure&quot; - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain&#x27;t 3D, and 2) it&#x27;s billed as an exercise in &quot;dominating&quot; the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.

                              <span>Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It&#x27;s boring because it&#x27;s a &quot;solved game&quot; whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the &quot;perfect&quot; player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We&#x27;d be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

                              <span>“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

But at least video games can help us speculate. Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a &quot;turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG&quot;, which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase. It was announced last year, but today it gets a release date and an updated demo.

                              <span>Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that makes video games smell. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream&#x27;s mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


&quot;But hold your horses, young Edwin,&quot; you sternly interject. &quot;I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick.&quot; Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge&#x27;s notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it&#x27;s known in the States - are rather in-depth. I&#x27;m still very glad I can&#x27;t smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

                              <span>Events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while devastating on the emotional wellbeing of hardware editors, are as useful for knocking a few more quid off already-cheap bits of gaming gear as they are for saving hundreds on big-ticket luxuries. It’s the re-bargainating aspect we must concern ourselves with here, as the Logitech G413 SE – already a premier choice of affordable mechanical gaming keyboard – is now more attainable still, dropping to £65 / $56.

                              <span>Anyone with the need for a new CPU and even the slightest inclination towards tech envy is currently waiting for new stock of the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the unbeatably powerful new chip that our boffin friends at Digital Foundry are calling the fastest gaming CPU ever. If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

                              <span>While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech&#x27;s worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
