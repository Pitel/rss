                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is finally out. It&#x27;s quite the scary ride, and one our review-in-progress offered plenty of praise for as Remedy Entertainment went back for round two. However, Alan Wake 2 may suffer a few launch hiccups, as an annoying audio issue affects some Xbox players.


After the sequel&#x27;s launch just days ago, player reports have included complaints about the game&#x27;s audio cutting out with no apparent cause. While the problem has no clear fix, Remedy Entertainment has acknowledged its existence and stated that it&#x27;s looking into a solution.




Remedy also released new patch notes regarding the new update today, bringing general bug fixes for the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions. On both consoles, the studio added localization fixes. Additionally, the Xbox version received tweaks for various visual issues and a problem where players would get soft-locked in interactions.


The Xbox version will also get what Remedy describes as a &quot;significantly friendlier&quot; error message when third-party software prevents the game from starting.


While some of those launch day woes may burden your early nightmares, there are more performance-friendly options to play Remedy&#x27;s follow-up. Prior to launch, communications director at Remedy Thomas Puha confirmed both Xbox Series X and PS5 versions would feature different visual modes so players could choose what they value most out of the experience. 


You can now experience the full horrors of Alan Wake 2 on PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>The Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song &quot;I Wanna Take You for a Ride.&quot; It&#x27;s been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. 




Marvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride


Despite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it&#x27;s one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.


The 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. 


Last year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a &quot;Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella&quot; Grammy for its cover of &quot;Meta Knight&#x27;s Revenge&quot; from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.


Perhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they&#x27;ll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, &quot;Game Changer,&quot; accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10.

                              <span>Life is not easy for Maomao, the central character of The Apothecary Diaries. The young apothecary lives a quiet life servicing the red-light district, until she&#x27;s one day kidnapped into servitude at the royal palace.


Here, she could have simply worked away the days until she made enough wages for freedom. But an illness falls over two of the emperor&#x27;s favorite concubines and their children, drawing Maomao&#x27;s curiosity. And from there, events spiral out to bring Maomao further into the viper&#x27;s nest of rear palace politics.


The Apothecary Diaries is certainly an interesting premise for an anime. If you&#x27;re newer to these stories, you might think of battle arcs and isekai series with bizarrely long names, with a few surprises and lowlights. This year has surprised me with its vibes few tim…</span>

Skyrim NPCs can survive decapitation


‌The world of Skyrim is a magical place, though not all the magics contained within are necessarily good ones.


Remember that guy who gets beheaded right at the start of Skyrim? Well, he does lose his head every time, as there&#x27;s no way to mess with that scripting, but the wound isn&#x27;t always fatal. This guy — as well as other enemies who wind up headless — can just get up and go on with their lives.

                              <span>I have to admit, when I first saw Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, I thought it was just a reskinned Far Cry. If anything, it reminded me of Far Cry: Primal. But I recently had the opportunity to jump into  a two-hour hands-on experience of an earlier section of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, where I realized it is not just Far Cry: Blue Edition. Sure, there are similarities to the open-world formula that Ubisoft has mastered over the years. But Frontiers of Pandora also builds upon the formula, while also melding it to fit the world of Pandora.


In the two hours I got to play, I only got to explore a small portion of the world and experience and even smaller part of the story. However, in the two hours I also got a good feel for what developer Massive Entertainment was going for. In Avatar: …</span>

Every time I visit my parents, where they still have cable, there’s some show about detailing cars or antiquing that is on TV. Fear Factor was something special, though. I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.


Fear Factor was a game show that was advertised as a show about people overcoming fear to both humiliate themselves and win money. I’m pretty sure people just tuned in to watch the contestants eat bugs, which was almost invariably what they did in the middle of the three events. But there are so many times you can air people cringing as they eat insects before even the least discerning audience gets bored, so the series only ran from 2001-2006. I say “only” …</span>

                              <span>When I saw the first trailer for Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, I immediately wanted to learn more. Every Riot Forge title so far has expanded on the already incredible IP of League of Legends and the world of Runeterra. And based on the trailer, it looked like Song of Nunu would be one of the most lore-rich titles from Riot Forge yet. I&#x27;m happy to say that I wasn&#x27;t wrong.


Throughout my journey as Nunu, I had fought off evil wolves with Braum, commanded Krugs with Nunu&#x27;s flute called the Svellsongur, and even forged a cauldron with the help of the legendary blacksmith Ornn. Song of Nunu was a pleasantly enjoyable voyage through the Freljord. And while it had its flaws, at the end of the roughly ten-hour adventure I was happy to have experienced it.

The original Metal Gear Solid is haunted by many ghosts


This one is a little hard to notice as it only shows up in second or further playthroughs of the original Metal Gear Solid. 


When we go for MGS&#x27; New Game+, we&#x27;ll get a digital camera from the get-go. Players can use this camera to snap pictures of cool-looking parts of the Shadow Moses military complex, but there&#x27;s a secret, darker, reason why the camera is there.

                              <span>Slay the Princess is both easy to describe, and difficult to truly dig into. The best I can offer is a word-salad of genre titles and inspirations: horror meta-narrative visual novel with hand-drawn visuals and strong voice acting, something akin to The Stanley Parable meets Mundaun.


And it can get even more difficult to pin down as it goes on. Slay the Princess feels dreamlike, constantly shifting but staying focused on the drama and tension between its characters. It is simple to get into, but Black Tabby&#x27;s words will linger in your mind long after journey&#x27;s end.


So let&#x27;s start at the beginning.




Slay the Princess (PC)

                              <span>In what&#x27;s already been a crazy 2023, it appears another big studio has undergone layoffs. An email sent to Bungie employees from Bungie CEO Pete Parsons indicated staff would be &quot;hearing some news today&quot; and that a team meeting scheduled for later would &quot;discuss today&#x27;s events&quot;. Jason Schreier at Bloomberg saw and reported the circulating email.


As of now the exact number of employees affected by the layoffs is unknown, but Twitter is already full of Bungie employees sharing the news that they have been laid off.



&quot;I&#x27;ve been laid off from Bungie. A surreal thing to write as I sit here pondering what went wrong. I&#x27;m still processing it all and while my first instinct is anger I know I&#x27;d regret what I&#x27;d say. Thank you to everyone at Bungie who helped make my last 5+ years the best ever.&quot;
- Griffin Bennett, Social Media Lead at Bungie



According to Bloomberg, employees also indicated delays across the board at Bungie. Upcoming Destiny 2 expansion The Final Shape has been pushed from February 2024 to June 2024. Also, Bungie&#x27;s next game, a sci-fi extraction shooter titled Marathon has been delayed to 2025.


Bungie joins a huge list of studios that have cut employees this year, which has led to one of the more tumultuous waves of layoffs the industry has seen in a while. The growing list includes Epic Games, Striking Distance Studios, CD Projekt Red, multiple studios owned by Embracer Group including Beamdog and Crystal Dynamics, Ubisoft, BioWare, Relic, Riot, Firaxis, Microsoft, Twitch, Naughty Dog, and Team17. This year has also seen the shutdown of several studios including Dang!, PixelOpus, Vanpool, and Volition Games.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be honest, Kingdom Hearts 4 isn&#x27;t coming anytime soon. So fans of the series may want to look elsewhere to get their fix of the Disney-verse. Luckily, with closed beta recruiting beginning today, Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link may not be all that far away.


Square Enix confirmed that Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link is arriving in 2024. Also, between today and November 19, iOS and Android users in the UK and Australia can sign up to potentially be chosen for the title&#x27;s upcoming closed beta. In total, roughly 3,000 participants will be selected across the two platforms. To commemorate the announcement, the publisher also dropped a new trailer for the game:

                              <span>We seem to be getting closer and closer to knowing whether Nvidia is planning a SUPER variant of the RTX 4080. While it&#x27;s not yet been confirmed to be in development, the supposed new model has been seen on an ID repository site.


As reported by PC Gamer, the unannounced RTX 4080 SUPER is now listed on PCI ID, a third-party database that lists hardware info. This particular entry was uploaded a few days ago, showing not only that it&#x27;ll be a SUPER rather than a Ti, but that it&#x27;ll utilize the AD103 chip.

Obviously, details about it are scarce at the moment. With speculations hotting up for this slightly souped up 4080, Nvidia may want to make a statement about it soon.


A (Ge)force to be reckoned with


Until we know for sure what&#x27;s going on with the refreshed card, we can only go off leaks and rumors. It was suggested recently that the alleged Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER would sport 20GB of VRAM. It also said that it would use the full AD102 chip, the same one the 4090 is built on.


However, if what the repository says is true, then it may be the AD103 instead, which is in-line with the current RTX 4080 model. The report from PC Gamer goes on to say that the SUPER could contain around 5.3% more shaders, based on hardware knowledge.


If it does come to fruition, it will likely offer a bit more juice than its regular RTX 4080 counterpart. However, if past experience is anything to go by – looking at you, RTX 3090 Ti – Nvidia may mark it up beyond what its specs suggest it&#x27;s actually worth.

                              <span>Last month, Falcom&#x27;s The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III and IV were announced for PlayStation 5. Now the pair of RPGs are locked in for February 16, 2024.


NIS America confirmed a launch date for the pair alongside a new gameplay trailer. After showing off some of the characters, the video quickly dives into the updated Erebonia experience. Rean Schwarzer and the Class VII: Special Operations squad then show off their skills with some flashy moves and Link Attacks. See how it all looks on PS5 below.




Keeping the trail hot


Both entries in the series — originally released in Japan in 2017 and 2018, respectively — will be available separately digitally. The real meat here is the two-in-one collection that includes a ton of role-playing bang for your buck. Those who want to burn approximately 99 of those bucks will be able to do so with the limited edition physical release. NIS America previously revealed the package, which includes the game, a soundtrack, art books, and more. 


After the original Japanese release, Trails of Cold Steel III launched globally in 2019, followed by IV in 2020. They&#x27;re also available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The PS5 release includes English and Japanese audio, as well as English and French text for III (just English for IV). Seeing everything these games have to offer could take 100 hours for each, so you might want to clear your calendar for the latter half of February.

                              <span>Ubisoft has revealed its various recommendations when it comes to PC hardware needed to run Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. They’re not especially surprising.


You’ll need a reasonably recent setup to actually get Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The minimum GPU is AMD RX 5700 or Nvidia Geforce 1070. The minimum required VRAM is 8GB. You’ll also need 90GB of free space on your hard drive and at least 18GB of RAM.


However, if you want to run everything at max and in 4K, you’ll need the latest generation of cards. This means at least an AMD RX 7900 XTX 24GB or an Nvidia RTX 4080 16GB. Even with that hardware, you’re still going to need to use AMD FSR2 at balanced settings to make up the extra frames. It also supports FSR3 and DLSS.

The beefy Ultra specs are likely due to the game’s usage of “Raytraced global illumination, reflections &amp; shadows.” It’s funny how the appreciable growth in graphical fidelity has decelerated significantly in the past couple of decades. If I were cynical, I’d think that a computational-heavy technique such as raytracing is so heavily pushed by tech companies as a way of ensuring that hardware still becomes obsolete at a consistent pace. I am cynical, so I do think that. But that&#x27;s not Ubisoft&#x27;s problem. They just want the bullet point. Ubisoft has other problems.


However, if you are down for playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, your computer can have a bit of dust on it if you are okay with the lower settings. However, if you want to enjoy all the splendor that Ubisoft can bring to Pandora, you’ll need something with a little more beef.


Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on December 7, 2023.

                              <span>Over the years, there&#x27;s been debate among fans about who fired the first nukes that kick-started the events of Fallout. Well, it looks as though this has been answered, as Tim Cain let the cat out of the vault, so to speak.


In a recent conversation with YouTube channel TKs-Mantis, Cain – who co-created the first two Fallout games – let it slip that China struck first. At around the 1:26:40 mark, he discusses the reason why America was nuked as part of the lore, related to how the US was creating an artificial virus known as FEV. It&#x27;s then  China is mentioned in the conversation, basically confirming the country was the first to strike when the states refused to cooperate. 




Host Mantis then, with raised eyebrows, tells Cain that what he just said was &quot;earth-shattering.&quot; At this point, Cain becomes a little coy, seemingly unaware that Fallout fans were not sure who &quot;shot first,&quot; adding, &quot;Oh, well then I don&#x27;t know... Who knows? It was probably some rogue nation.&quot;


Let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s no immediate fallout from this revelation


Leonard Boyarsky – the other co-creator of the early Fallout entries – has gone on record saying that it doesn&#x27;t really matter who launched the first attack. However, this recent slip up from Cain basically confirms what some may already have suspected.


In any case, it&#x27;s a neat little bit of extra lore for those who are big into the post-apocalyptic franchise&#x27;s universe. Who launched the first nuclear bombs is something that&#x27;s been talked about for over two and a half decades. Now, it looks like we have closure.


On top of that, we&#x27;ve also recently learned that the Fallout TV show releases in April 2024. With the success of the Last of Us adaptation, others will no doubt be wanting to follow in those footsteps.

                              <span>Despite being an Epic Game Store exclusive, people have figured out how to play Alan Wake 2 on Valve&#x27;s handheld. Though it is possible, poor performance means it&#x27;s not necessarily a good idea. 


To get Remedy&#x27;s latest game running on the Steam Deck, you&#x27;ll need to jump through a few hoops. Your first obstacle is the fact that the game is exclusive to the Epic Game Store launcher. To get around this, switch to Desktop mode then download the Epic Games Store launcher. You can then launch it from Steam by adding it to your library as a non-Steam game. 


Alternatively, you can use the Heroic Launcher which is an app that combines your libraries from a few launchers including EGS and GOG. Either way, once you&#x27;ve got your EGS library accessible on your Steam Deck, all that&#x27;s left is to download Alan Wake 2 and play. You may need to download Proton tools to force compatibility. 


Just because you can do it, doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Those who have gotten the game to run on the Deck don&#x27;t report good performance. With settings at low, YouTuber Deck Wizard manages to have the game running at around 24FPS in the woods. Steam Deck Review and Tips&#x27; FPS sits in the low 20s as well. 


It&#x27;s no surprise that the Deck struggles to run the game, as it extremely demanding even on regular PCs. When the recommended PC specs were revealed, it shocked many, as DLSS is heavily relied upon. It is arguably worth it, as Alan Wake 2 is one of the best-looking games of the current generation. 


Alan Wake 2 isn&#x27;t the only game released this year that the Deck struggles to run. It also had a hard time with Starfield and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

                              <span>Drago Entertainment has announced that their 2021 surprise hit, Gas Station Simulator, will be receiving a whopping four DLC packs for 2024. They’ve even outlined what to expect in each pack.


You might wonder what significant additions can even be added to a game about running a gas station. To Drago’s credit, they’ve got some decent ideas for it. The first expansion they have planned is Tidal Wave, which transplants your gas station out of the barren Dust Bowl and onto a tropical island. Rather than just being an aesthetic change, they tout that the new location will be “governed by its own unique rules” and then specifically mention “God appeasement.” I guess don’t dump your used motor oil into the volcano’s crater.


The second planned DLC for Gas Station Simulator is Shady Deals, whi…</span>

                              <span>Rare&#x27;s Perfect Dark is a spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007, one of the most influential shooters of the Nintendo 64 era. If you&#x27;ve never played the original capers of special agent Joanna Dark, you can now check it out on PC.


Although it&#x27;s an unofficial port, GitHub user fgsfds has made Perfect Dark playable on PC, which not only brings the classic 2000 game back from the dead, but adds extra features. For example, mouselook, widescreen support, FOV, and more have been implemented.

The download page notes the game is &quot;in a mostly functional state.&quot; Indeed, a report from DSO Gaming says the port does have some bugs, &quot;but not any game-breaking issues.&quot; The only thing you may need to consider is that it&#x27;s only available on 32-bit operating systems. 


When Rare games weren&#x27;t so rare


Perfect Dark represents a grander time for developer Rare. Hot off the immense success of GoldenEye on the N64, the relatively small British studio was the darlings of a bygone Nintendo era.


The team is responsible for some of the most memorable games of the 90s. Setting standards with the release of Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, Rare consistently knocked it out of the park for years to come. Just ask anyone who remembers Banjo-Kazooie, Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day, or Killer Instinct.


As for Perfect Dark itself, the series has struggled to make much impact in more modern times. While there is a reboot in development, conflicts mean we might not see it for a good few years.

                              <span>We&#x27;re about to gain access to even more retro classics on Switch (and several other platforms) come January. The Top Racer Collection features remastered SNES racing games to play, and it&#x27;s set to launch on January 11, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One/Series S|X, and Steam.


The Top Racer Collection will feature the popular ‘90s racing trilogy Top Gear, Top Gear 2, and Top Gear 3000. First hitting the shelves in 1992, the SNES high-speed racing series gained popularity among fans across the globe. Top Gear’s original Japanese title, Top Racer (a moniker that is now being ported over to the entire collection), is being adapted for the collection’s upcoming release. Although the series was competing with other popular racers such as Mario Kart and F-Zero, Top Gear still left an impact on the gaming industry.


With Top Gear being one of the most memorable racing trilogies in gaming history, fans will get a chance to play a wider range of classic racing games. Beyond that, they’ll also be able to enjoy the full Top Gear experience with newly implemented gameplay modes and filters. Both online and offline multiplayer modes will be available for players to choose from. And of course, the great soundtrack that accompanies the game will be featured as well.




Top Gear meets Horizon Chase


Alongside the Top Gear trilogy, an all-new collaboration game is coming as part of the collection. Top Racer Crossroads is a special crossover with Horizon Chase. The crossover is set to feature aspects of both games within the collection. This is a treat for Switch fans specifically: Nintendo already has a wide range of classic titles for fans to enjoy, but adding more SNES games to the platform any way possible is a great thing.

                              <span>Sad news mobile enthusiasts...another popular game out of Japan is shuttering its servers. The game in question is SINoALICE developed by Pokelabo and published by SquareEnix, which originally launched in Japan in June 2017 and worldwide in July 2020. 


The announcement (via Crunchyroll News) also states that the manga adaptation will conclude with the sixth volume, which will hit store shelves in Japan in January 2024. SquareEnix will release the fifth volume of the manga in English on November 23, 2023.  Along with the reveal of the game’s imminent closure, SINoALICE has also halted the sale of its premium currency. If you still have unused crystals, you can request a refund but fans are out of luck with already purchased items.


The global developer for SINoALICE, Nexon Korea Corporation, describes the roleplaying game as:



SINoALICE is a chilling retelling of classic fairy tale within an unsettling dark fantasy world inspired by the game&#x27;s creative director, Yokō Tarō (NieR:Automata). The game follows several popular fairy tale heroes as they work together to navigate perilous lands, battle menacing enemies and solve mind-bending puzzles to resurrect the storytellers that created them.




When does SINoALICE shut down?


For those who are still active players of the game or want to check it out while you still have the chance, the global servers will deactivate on November 15. The DMM and browser versions of the game will be deactivated on December 26th, and finally, the service will end in Japan on January 15th. 


Unfortunately, SINoALICE only received mixed reviews upon its global release. While this will likely never be Yoko Taro&#x27;s most memorable work, it might not be a bad idea to check out this title while you still can do so. This is especially true for those who enjoyed his previous projects, NieR and Drakengard.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation. That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

Various former Bungie employees announced on Twitter today they had been laid off, and Bloomberg has confirmed with its sources that an undisclosed number of staff were laid off today. 
Bloomberg reports that Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staffers they&#x27;d be &quot;hearing some news today&quot; and that following it, there would be a team meeting later today to &quot;discuss today&#x27;s events.&quot; 


As for why employees were laid off, that remains unclear, especially as the company is set to release a massive Destiny 2 expansion – The Final Shape – that&#x27;s set to end the decade-long saga that began in the first Destiny game. Bloomberg states that its sources say The Fi…</span>

If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That&#x27;s eight days before the full game&#x27;s release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you&#x27;ve played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you&#x27;re in for, and this year&#x27;s is not all that different. But if you&#x27;re new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year&#x27;s entry, we&#x27;ve got you covered.

                              <span>Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game&#x27;s protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG&#x27;s combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

Valve have promised that more modes, weapons and features are headed to Global Offensive’s full-bore sequel, but they might take a little while to arrive as they respond to what players are asking for.

You’ll also be able to give it a listen - and you might notice something a little off about the announcers for its game show-within-a-game when you do. That’s right: they’re AI-generated voices, not human actors.

                              <span>Crytek have no plans to make a sequel to sweaty monster-culling FPS Hunt: Showdown, and will thus hopefully avoid the publicity problems currently faced by Activision-Blizzard&#x27;s Overwatch 2 and Valve&#x27;s Counter-Strike 2 - both presented as sequels with fancier technology, but in practice, more like service-game content seasons arbitrarily upgraded into replacements, with the &#x27;previous&#x27; games, Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, being taken offline to avoid splitting the playerbase. 


Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt&#x27;s evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game&#x27;s general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won&#x27;t be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won&#x27;t come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

                              <span>Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft&#x27;s next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn&#x27;t quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft&#x27;s lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I&#x27;ve finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual &quot;next-gen&quot; blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we&#x27;re already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft&#x27;s UK offices: &quot;I can&#x27;t work out where the heck I&#x27;m meant to be going, or what I&#x27;m supposed to do.&quot;

                              <span>An Itch.io game bundle launched to fund medical services and support for Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and Lebanon has raised $200,000 in five days. Organised by Esther Wallace of Oak Grove Games, and due to run till 9th November 2023, the Games for Gaza bundle includes 256 videogames, physical games, assets, soundtracks and books from 140 designers for $10, with all proceeds going to the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.

                              <span>Apologies to the chief, but there’s a not-entirely-accurate bit in Katharine’s post announcing Starfield as October’s RPS Game Club game. I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

                              <span>Some people sing the praises of &quot;visceral&quot; games. Others extol the virtues of &quot;immersive&quot; games. Me, I&#x27;m increasingly drawn to &quot;perverse&quot; games. No, not like that. Well, not entirely like that. I mean &quot;perverse&quot; more straightforwardly as in deliberately awkward and unreceptive in their core design, almost self-defeating in a way that has you saying &quot;WTF?&quot; and hankering to know more.
Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Porto, Portugal-based Dobra Studios. It&#x27;s about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It&#x27;s a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

                              <span>When was the last time you played a good 3D character platformer? For me, it was probably Psychonauts 2. But before that? Outside of Mario? I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there&#x27;s much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don&#x27;t need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Jim&#x27;s got some not-so-wonderful thoughts about the residents of Mario&#x27;s latest 2D adventure...


You don&#x27;t need me to tell you just how charming Super Mario Bros. Wonder is. You only need to briefly glance at Twitter to see the same comments crop up repeatedly: the visuals are brilliant, the level design is great, the Badge system keeps things interesting, etc. And I agree with everyone online wholeheartedly — it is rather wonderful. But let&#x27;s not be blinded by the shiny facade of the Flower Kingdom to the point where we can&#x27;t see the bad seed growing inside — those flippin&#x27; Poplins.

Earlier this year, Team Hookshot (Nintendo Life, Push Square, Pure Xbox, and Time Extension) all got together for an annual gathering filled with laughs, snacks, and sheer lunacy.
To make the most of the event, our lovely video producer Zion decided to challenge Alex and Felix to a wee game of &quot;Guess the Nintendo Accessory&quot;, in which our competitors are blindfolded and required to fondle a number of first-party Nintendo accessories in order to guess what they are.

It’s been a busy year for Riot’s new Forge publishing arm, aimed at expanding its League of Legends Runeterra universe in games beyond the popular MOBA. In April, we got The Mageseeker, a hi-bit brawler set in the austere kingdom of Demacia, and in June, we got Convergence, a traditional Metroidvania set in the seedy depths of the city of Zaun. To finish out the year, the company has now published Song of Nunu, a narrative action game developed by Tequila Works, which previously developed RiME back in the early days of the Switch library. We’re pleased to report that Song of Nunu is yet another strong addition to the Runeterra universe, expertly combining a gripping narrative with enjoyable gameplay.
Song of Nunu is set in the Freljord, a harsh, frigid, mountainous region in the north of Runeterra, and follows the adventures of an energetic young boy named Nunu and his affable yeti friend, Willump. Nunu’s mother has gone missing since his camp was attacked by raiders and he keeps having dreams where she tells him to find “The Heart of the Blue” at the Winged Mountain. Aided by Willump’s strength, Nunu sets out on a quest to reach the mountain, where he expects to find some answers about what happened to his mother and hopes to be reunited with her. All the while, however, the two are unknowingly pursued by a dangerous ice witch named Lissandra, who wishes to use Willump’s unique powers to help her fight back against a shadowy force that threatens the whole Freljord.

Masahiro Sakurai, the director of the Smash Bros. franchise, has released a new video looking back on the development of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Switch.
During the 12-13 minute presentation, Sakurai delves into the copious adjustments and additions required to make Ultimate appeal to both veterans and newcomers, the difficulties faced when dealing with a 16GB Switch cartridge vs a 25GB Wii U disc, and the effects the Covid-19 pandemic had on development for the DLC characters.

Taking the spotlight this time is Hisuian Typhlosion, which you will be able to face off against from 3rd-5th November and then a week later from 10th-12th. The regional variant of the Gen II starter will be a Fire Tera Type and will hold the Mightiest Mark. As usual, those who are successful in the battle will only be able to catch the starring &#x27;mon once per save file.

It was a pretty close competition this time around, but the Ghost supporters managed to pick up the most points over the course of the event amassing a total of 33p compared to Team Skeleton&#x27;s 24p — the less said about Team Zombie, the better...

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Ethan chateaus himself in the creepiest place in the Pokémon world...

Ah, Lavender Town — the place where the journeys of old Pokémon end and the nightmares of young trainers are born. This gothic locale from the original Game Boy titles has transcended its franchise into an iconic piece of pop culture in its own right, and it’s not hard to see why. Between its downbeat aesthetic, its surprisingly forward exploration of mortality, and its plethora of associated internet legends, Lavender Town absolutely deserves its reputation as one of the most memorably spooky places in gaming.

The latest one focused on Nintendo&#x27;s 2023 game of the year contender The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, asking readers who their favourite character is in Link&#x27;s latest outing and Princess Zelda took out the top spot. Link was second and Ganondorf was in 8th spot.

Dragon Quest has already been in the headlines this week after new trailer uploads for Dragon Quest X Offline appeared on YouTube, and now, Square Enix producer and director Yosuke Saito appears to be teasing something.
According to a translation of a social media post (via Eurogamer), he&#x27;s recently had a &quot;fun recording session&quot; at work, and apparently more will be revealed once it&#x27;s all been finalised and approved. What&#x27;s really got fans excited is a photo attached to this post showing off a script.

Hello, and welcome back to another edition of Box Art Brawl, folks!
Before we get cracking, let&#x27;s take a peek at what went down last week. The delightful Wario Land: Shake It! entered the ring with a classic three-way brawl. It was, expectedly, a tense battle, but the European design took home the rhetorical trophy after landing 44% of the vote. North America came in second place with 32% and Japan in third place with 23%.

Capcom shared its latest earning results earlier this week, and as part of this, it&#x27;s also published a Q&amp;A revealing its intentions to release a &quot;major&quot; unannounced title early next year.
As highlighted by fans of the Japanese company, this game will arrive before the end of its current fiscal year, which is set to end in March 2024. The same title will apparently help the Japanese company reach its end-of-year sales targets, but there&#x27;s no information beyond this.

Time Extension recently got the chance to speak to Coleco exec Bert Reiner about the history of the American toy and console maker. According to his account, there was a time when Nintendo almost ended up buying and marketing the 1982 video game system &#x27;ColecoVision&#x27; for Japan but negotiations fell through.
The former Coleco vice president of product development claims Nintendo wanted to do its own deal, and eventually, it got to the point where its company president Hiroshi Yamauchi said Nintendo would develop its own console. This exchange was followed by the launch of the Famicom in 1983.

                              <span>There was a time when print media and pixel art were like peanut butter and jelly. Before the advent of polygon-based graphics and online storefronts, nearly every game was made from chunky grids of color, and at retail, every game came with a printed instruction manual showing how to play it.


Flash forward to 2023, and the bulk of the world&#x27;s biggest games are molded from three-dimensional shapes and are downloaded directly to hard drives. The mosaic beauty of dot art, and the tactile experience of turning a page in a book about that art, have both become niche enterprises. 


But if there&#x27;s one thing we&#x27;ve learned in games over the years, it&#x27;s that even the tiniest niches can find ways to thrive. Believe it or not, even the mighty Minecraft was once a humble indie game only known to industry enthusiasts and insiders. And it&#x27;s possible that Waneella, who contributed environmental art to games like River City Girls and Pocket Rumble, could break through in a similar way. She may not have her stuff sold in the toy section of Target any time soon, but I could see her work blowing up in the fine art world in the years to come. 


Decade is a new book from talented pixel artist Waneela





A case in point is her current collaboration with Darren Wall (Read-only Memory, A Profound Waste of Time) on &quot;Decade,&quot; an artbook that collects ten years of her still pictures. Initially inspired by the pixel art of Superbrothers Sword and Sworcery EP, Waneella has since grown in popularity as an independent creator. Her compositions translate great to glowing screens, but bringing them to books makes even more sense. It&#x27;s easy to picture people from all walks of life cozying up to a warm mug of the drink of their choice, cracking open her book, and being transported to places that sit somewhere between games and the real world, dreams, and reality. 


You can find the Volume crowdfunding effort for it here!

9. Gekko (MGS4)


Features: The Gekko units don&#x27;t require a pilot and can work as a team.


The Gekkos are very disappointing from a design standpoint. They&#x27;re the legs of Metal Gear RAY stitched to the torso of REX but without the charisma of either model.


Metal Gear Solid 2 began by introducing Metal Gear RAY, which owns, and then went on to introduce Arsenal Gear, an even bigger and crazier Metal Gear. The Gekko was the first new Metal Gear model introduced in Metal Gear Solid 4. The Gekko isn&#x27;t very impressive, so I kept waiting for some wilder threat to show up. Nothing e…</span>

                              <span>In the early to mid 2000s, it was popular to turn every survival horror game into a movie. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and… OK, maybe there weren’t that many actually. In recent years, the tables have turned with iconic horror films like Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, both receiving video game adaptations. This begs the question, what other horror movies deserve their own game?


Horror movies that should definitively have a video game


Light spoiler warning for all items ahead. Go see these movies; they’re well worth it!




#10 - Tusk (2014)


That’s right, this list is starting off weird. Featuring director Kevin Smith and actors who probably owe him a life debt, Tusk explores the horror of a man becoming a grotesque creature of the sea. The movie does a decent job of sho…</span>

At one end of the Pokémon character design spectrum, you have some of the cutest little guys to have ever graced our screens. On the other, you have pure, unapologetic nightmare fuel. As we approach Halloween, it seems only fitting that we take a look at the latter, right?
Okay, perhaps delving into the complete horrors of the Pokédex would be stretching things too far (and we have already considered which &#x27;mon would be the tastiest in the past if you&#x27;re really after some horror), but spookiest... now that&#x27;s another question entirely. These guys are not necessarily the most terrifying to look at (you won&#x27;t find any Guzzlord, Mawile, or Machamp in his black little pants here) nor are they the ones with objectively the most worrying abilities (sorry, Mr. Mime. And yep, you too, Malamar), no. These are just the spookiest out there — those who embody all things Halloween making them, yes, pretty scary, but also a little cute.

If you had a Nintendo 64, there&#x27;s no doubt you managed to wrangle your family (or friends) in for a few games of a few multiplayer games featuring the Italian plumber at Christmas. But, of all of them, Mario Party may have spawned a few too many arguments that have spawned an amusing life-long legacy of familial rivalries and blistered hands.

Wonder, we chewed over the most difficult Mario games and we jumped for joy as Mario Party 3 was finally added to NSO. It&#x27;s a lot of Mario, yes, but can you blame us?

After a recent teaser, Bandai Namco has now lifted the lid on Season 4 of Dragon Ball: The Breakers, arriving 1st November.
As many fans guessed, the new raider joining the battle is Broly (available with TP Tokens). It doesn&#x27;t end there, either. In addition to this are new survivor skins including Cheelai, Lemo, Bulma (Snow Gear) and Mr. Satan. This skin is available via Dragon Tier and the rest will be unlockable with TP Tokens. In the trailer above you can also spot a Gogeta cameo!

                              <span>Ebay has decided we have entered Halloween season with the publication of a SPOOKY20 code good for 20% off a range of PC gaming components and peripherals (and other stuff). 
We&#x27;re zeroing in on an RX 7800 XT graphics card, the best value option from AMD&#x27;s RDNA 3 lineup. The Gigabyte Gaming OC model is down to £485 from a price of £560. That&#x27;s a good deal, with the cheapest RX 7800 XT elsewhere coming in at £510.

                              <span>If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, &quot;grainwake&quot; sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it&#x27;s a difficult experience. It looks it.

Today we&#x27;re going one better, with a 27-inch model that costs just $160 with free shipping from Monoprice. The Dark Matter 27-inch monitor is one we&#x27;ve recommended before, and though it lacks the Fast IPS panel we prefer it&#x27;s still a solid option at this incredibly competitive price point.

                              <span>After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy&#x27;s horror-fuelled detective &#x27;em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm&#x27;s length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d&#x27;etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, &quot;Objection!&quot; you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It&#x27;s delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

                              <span>Capcom have unveiled the next generation of their in-house RE Engine, which came in alongside Resident Evil 7 in 2017 and has been used by a bunch of projects over the years, from the excellent Devil May Cry 5 to the forthcoming possibly-excellent Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. RE Engine&#x27;s successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

Playing beyond that has elevated it from &quot;not my thing but I should cover it because it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;wait, this might be my thing? Damn it&quot;.

In Free Range Games&#x27;s plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you&#x27;re a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron&#x27;s defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can&#x27;t make my base of operations symmetrical.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Square Enix decided to ruin over a decade&#x27;s worth of CD collecting by sticking all of their incredible Final Fantasy Piano Collection soundtracks online, for free, on pretty much every streaming service imaginable. The sheer cheek of it! Honestly, I&#x27;m still mildly shocked by it all. Just the thought of all that brilliant music, available to everyone, for zero pence and import fees. What an outstanding gift to the world. (Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I&#x27;ll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there&#x27;s an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you&#x27;re wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy&#x27;s best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

                              <span>The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this &quot;bizarre story.&quot;

                              <span>You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to &quot;look at the image quality&quot; instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

                              <span>Crytek&#x27;s Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter&#x27;s wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0&#x27;s enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

                              <span>You haven&#x27;t even downloaded Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you&#x27;re planning to, which means it&#x27;s already time to start thinking about what you&#x27;ll do once you&#x27;ve finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy&#x27;s plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka &quot;Final Draft&quot;, which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake&#x27;s fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves &quot;an independent government organization&quot; that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

                              <span>Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I&#x27;d like to see the two game series share the same universe.</span>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.
Like its predecessors, UFC 5 apt…</span>

                              <span>A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as &quot;Monster Baby&quot;. It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later.

The annual event attracts thousands of horror and theme park enthusiasts every September to experience a park that transforms into a twisted, macabre version of itself at dusk all the way up to Halloween.

                              <span>After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season&#x27;s map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it&#x27;s happening. 
Today&#x27;s reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, &quot;Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG&quot; with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it&#x27;s likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3.

The soundtrack, which also features music by composers Marcin Przybyłowicz and P.T.

The release of the Edgerunners soundtrack follows the debut of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty last month, alongside the standard edition and Deluxe Edition release of the Phantom Liberty score. You can listen …</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
&quot;On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged,&quot; an Atari press release reads. &quot;The latest entry in Atari&#x27;s acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto&#x27;s droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer.&quot; 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below:

                              <span>Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader&#x27;s cinematic history because Robert Pattinson&#x27;s suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve&#x27;s 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton&#x27;s from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale&#x27;s from The Dark Knight. Here&#x27;s hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

                              <span>The first Alan Wake game was released 13 years ago, in 2010. As is the case with any cult game, new fans have been discovering it in the years since, and a recent remaster means many more have likely played the game recently. For those who played it when it came out, however, jumping into Alan Wake 2 can be confusing. The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google. No major story elements of Alan Wake 2 are spoiled,…</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, I&#x27;ve assembled a panel of experts – including Blake Hester and Charles Harte – to discuss Alan Wake 2, the 13-year follow-up to Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s cult classic thriller. After Charles gives the rest of us a refresher on all things Alan Wake, Blake regales us with his favorite non-spoiler moments from many hours into the newly-released sequel. Later, we talk about the written and physical comedy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder and how web gliding is a game changer in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2.
Stick around &#x27;til the end of the show for a series of listener questions about soulmates, the afterlife, and the best years in gaming.

                              <span>I sincerely don’t envy the position Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is in.


The middle entry of a trilogy is always a precarious thing. On one hand, it lacks the opening act to introduce the cast and get players excited for the story. At the same time, middle entries also can’t culminate in the story’s ultimate climax. Combine that with being part of a remake of one of the most beloved RPGs of all time, and you have a game that really needs to come prepared to impress. After all, Final Fantasy 7 Remake already indulged us in seeing Cloud and friends in glorious HD. Can Rebirth leave a lasting impression after that novelty has worn off?


In search of an answer to this question, I attended an event hosted by Square Enix to play some of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for myself. This demo took me through …</span>

                              <span>Nintendo recently got competitive fans of its various franchises riled up after releasing a list of strict guidelines for community tournaments. 


The gaming giant posted their new tournament guidelines on their respective websites in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. on Tuesday. Since the announcement on October 24, fans have taken to the streets (of Twitter) to express their dismay.


The guidelines in question


After looking over the guidelines, it is clear that several facilitate fiscal policy. Some of the other guidelines put emphasis on the number of players who were allowed to participate.


Here are a few of the guidelines that stood out to fans:



Community tournaments may not “generate commercial revenue except as permitted by these guidelines”


Only 200 players can participate fo…</span>

                              <span>I met the man who would become my husband at about the time that I started venturing more into horror games. I had just discovered that a switch had flipped in my head, and I was now immune to video game scares. 


He suggested Fatal Frame to me, insisting that it was the scariest game ever made. He even went as far as buying me a copy of it for Xbox. It was my introduction to the series, but the first game I wound up completing was Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse for my review right here on Destructoid. I didn’t complete it back in 2016 in my first experience with it.


There were a few reasons for why I dropped it, but they’re pretty boring. Being scary wasn’t one of them. Though, its controls are horrifying for a different reason.

                              <span>It looks like Gameloft’s Disney Dreamlight Valley won’t be a free-to-play title after all. 


Dreamlight Valley is the Disney meets Animal Crossing game that entered Early Access back in September. Players could get in the game by purchasing a Founder’s Pack. Each pack included some cosmetic items and varying amounts of Moonstones, the game’s premium currency. 


The game is set to officially launch on December 5. Ahead of the full release, Gameloft has made an announcement ending the free-to-play plans. “As we look ahead to the official launch, with the learnings we&#x27;ve gained from Early Access, we’ve made the decision to remain a paid game for the foreseeable future,” the developer wrote.

                              <span>The Tekken series is renowned across the world, and Tekken Tag Tournament is one of the most memorable titles in the series.


Why is it so special? Well, you can switch characters mid-combo, giving the 3D fighting formula a nice kick in the pants; but funnily enough, it only took Namco two months to develop the game (according to Tekken steward Katsuhiro Harada).




“The project took 5 minutes to plan and only 2 months to develop (arcade version),&quot; said Harada recently on social media. Harada says the game &quot;made a considerable profit&quot; because the cost was low. To add more context, Tekken 3 was completed, and then management at Namco &quot;ordered [Harada] to release&quot; a 3.5 version &quot;within six months.&quot; At the time, the team was working on a prototype for Tekken 4, which was eventually released…</span>

Going as far back as the tinny notes of Halloween on Atari 2600, there&#x27;s something about the limitations that make these soundtracks even creepier. Without access to orchestration or even proper synths, retro horror games have held on to a unique kind of spookiness. They&#x27;re equal parts charming and, in some cases, manage to nail the vibe of their source material without carrying over every single note. In honor of those unusual, haunting melodies, we&#x27;ll take a moment to touch on a handful of them.

There have been plenty of Ghostbusters games across all platforms in the years since Egon, Ray, Winston, and Peter first busted onto screens in 1984, and they run the gamut from classic licensed cash-in to carefully constructed homage.
The first Ghostbusters game Nintendo fans got their hands on was a NES port of the David Crane-designed 1984 home computer game, but in the decades since there has been a good selection of spooky emissions on Nintendo platforms, several of which rank among the very best Ghostbusters games anywhere.

After being in early access for the past year, Gameloft has today revealed that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be officially launching on 5th December. There is one small change to the proceedings, however, as the publisher announced that the title will &quot;will not make the transition to be a free-to-play game&quot;, despite being described as one up until this point.

Dave the Diver is a game about a diver named Dave. It&#x27;s also about a restauranteur, archaeologist, marine researcher, and social media genius — also Dave. Poor ol&#x27; Dave has to wear all these hats in Dave the Diver, and living out his toilsome existence makes for one of the best games of the year and easily one of the Switch&#x27;s most clever indie games in ages thanks to its oddly gripping loop, charming writing, consistent sense of humor, and immaculate vibes.
Anyone who&#x27;s worked at a bar or restaurant with a small staff will tell you that those jobs aren&#x27;t just about prepping food, waiting on tables, or mixing cocktails.

                              <span>After 13 years, Alan Wake 2 is nearly here. But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it&#x27;s fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you&#x27;re in the right place; here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn&#x27;t written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…</span>

This news comes from a new report at The Verge, which writes that Microsoft head of studios and corporate vice president Matt Booty has been promoted to president of game content and studios, and that Microsoft corporate vice president Sarah Bond has been promoted to Xbox president. She will oversee all Xbox platform responsibilities. 
The Verge also reports that after 32 years, chief marketing officer Chris Capossela is stepping down from Microsoft. 
In Booty&#x27;s new position, he will &quot;lead an expanded organization inside Microsoft Gaming that now includes ZeniMax and Bethesda,&quot; according to the publication.…</span>

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it&#x27;s already Sony&#x27;s fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game&#x27;s stability. Here&#x27;s the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit&#x27;s Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
&quot;Today&#x27;s patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,&quot; it reads. &quot;We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future.&quot; 


Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here – it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on Friday, October 27. Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2&#x27;s PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we&#x27;ll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they&#x27;ve opted to experience Remedy&#x27;s latest in.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallat…</span>

It didn&#x27;t quite land for us – Game Informer gave it a 6 out of 10 – but a new update that launches later today fixes one of the major problems we had with the soulslike. That&#x27;s because the new Pumpkin Patch update that launches at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET today comes with reduced enemy density. Plus, the patch brings full crossplay to the game alongside performance and stability fixes and more.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series. 


Resident Evil 4 has sold 5.45 million units, while Street Fighter 6 is at 2.47 million units sold. Monster Hunter Rise, with its Sunbreak expansion, has crossed 6.5 million units sold. Capcom has also revealed that its remake of Resident Evil 2 has sold more than 13 million units, with its remake of Resident Evil 3 sitting at 8 million units sold. The recently released Monster Hunter Now, a Monster Hunter take on Pokemon Go, has been downloaded more than 10 million times by players as of last week. 
Capcom says the entire Resident Evil series has sold more than 150 million units, with Monster Hunter crossing 95 million. The Street Fighter franchise sits at 52 million. Here are some other series highlights: 
Mega Man: 41 million units sold
Devil May Cry: 30 million units sold
Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: 7.9 million

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 finally hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow, on Friday, October 27. After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game&#x27;s release is almost here. After getting a new launch trailer yesterday that showed more of this spooky world, developer Remedy Entertainment has another pre-launch update to share: New Game+ will arrive sometime after the game&#x27;s launch. 
This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an &quot;alternative narrative&quot; that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it&#x27;s due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided. 
New Game+ coming after launch.

For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

A major free update is out today, Naval Warfare, which as the name suggets brings that persistent online war to the sea, with gunboats, destroyers and beach landings to contend with.

CDPR continue to fix them, too. Patch 2.02 is out now.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s multiplayer Jolly Rog &#x27;em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it&#x27;s now due to make landfall in the publisher&#x27;s FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What&#x27;s the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for &quot;vapourware&quot;? I&#x27;m picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn&#x27;t the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious &quot;large game&quot;, originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws.

Now it&#x27;s virtual reality&#x27;s turn, with the launch of SteamVR 2.0.

The first patch is out now and it includes optimisations for rendering, fog, depth-of-field and more designed to make the citybuilder&#x27;s framerates less gridlocked.

It&#x27;s much more common to see 27-inch monitors at this resolution, with a 24-inch screen providing a sharper image as a result of a higher DPI. This model from Chinese manufacturer Koorui also comes with a Fast IPS panel with 1ms GtG pixel response times and a 165Hz refresh rate, making it a great choice for fast-paced gaming too. 
This Koorui monitor has also been reduced in price, dropping from an initial MSRP of $400 to just $200 after a cool 50% reduction - with a $15 gift card thrown in too.

                              <span>Ask RPS returns for another installment today, this time focusing on some of our daily food and drink habits. Technically, I have mashed two supporter questions into one for this post, as to me they seemed inherently linked, because what is the point of tea/coffee if not to also have a nice biscuit and a sit down at the same time?
With that in mind, today&#x27;s questions come courtesy of caff, who asked: What is your favourite biscuit? and PolygonClassicist, who asked: What are the caffeine habits of the RPS staff? (along with the extra sub-question clarifications of: when do we like to have our coffee, espresso, tea, soda and/or energy drinks? How do we like to consume them? And how much caffeine do we all consume on a daily basis?) Come and find out how we all get through the day (in a, err, not at all dark way) below!

                              <span>OK, so there&#x27;s plenty in Worldless that won&#x27;t remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you&#x27;re a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You&#x27;re Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you&#x27;ll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it&#x27;s turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry&#x27;s work? Partly it&#x27;s the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you&#x27;ll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it&#x27;s the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it&#x27;s the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you&#x27;re beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless&#x27;s release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

                              <span>The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it&#x27;s imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it&#x27;s really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy&#x27;s most sophisticated tale yet.

                              <span>What better way to follow up my interview with Just Stop Oil than by writing about a horror game set on a haunted oil rig? The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

                              <span>At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell&#x27;s sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map &quot;powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline&quot;.
I&#x27;ve written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I&#x27;ve also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn&#x27;t glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group&#x27;s tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&#x27;s online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it&#x27;s jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare&#x27;s original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be &quot;unfair&quot;.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that present decisions deciding past events is better than that puzzle where switches turn on some things while turning off others. I can&#x27;t say I am surprised by the result, and suspect it was heavily influenced by spite, but I am very grateful to the people who stood up and explained why they like that puzzle where etc. I do try to make a case for both things but won&#x27;t pretend I understand (or appreciate) every thing in games, so I appreciate your help. This week, I ask you to pick between two ways of being there and then not. What&#x27;s better: summoning spectral animals or blink teleports?

Every October it pops up to make your Halloween season orange and flickery with a host of digital carved pumpkins on display in a lovely gallery you can take a calming walk around. I hope this comes to be a seasonal tradition on RPS as unshakeable as Skeal at Christmas. And it&#x27;s pay-what-you-can on Itch!

                              <span>When two of a game&#x27;s weapons are nailguns, you should probably expect players to be enthusiastic about construction. Following last year&#x27;s excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.

It&#x27;s a turn-based tactics RPG with a Gothic historical setting, an extremely late-noughties insanity mechanic, a heavy metal soundtrack, plagues, heresy, dynastic feuding, and a protagonist with a dramatic eye scar and possibly non-metaphorical &quot;inner demons&quot;. Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I&#x27;ve been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there&#x27;s this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

                              <span>American McGee has spent the past several years trying to make Alice: Asylum, a third entry in his series of action-horror games inspired by Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland. That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had &quot;no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made.&quot;

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project&#x27;s end, but he did suggest one &quot;ray of hope&quot; to the community. &quot;The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible.&quot;

                              <span>In 2008, Robert Downey Jr. debuted as Tony Stark in Iron Man. Outside of being an excellent movie in its own right, Iron Man proved to be one of the most influential films of the 21st century so far, paving the way to the biggest film and TV franchise of the last decade and a half, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.
At the time, &quot;The Avenger Initiative&quot; felt like a throwaway tease for something that would never happen (even for those involved in writing the scene), but films starring Captain America, Thor, and Hulk started building an unprecedented interconnectivity.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is almost here. It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter&#x27;s ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2&#x27;s live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game&#x27;s story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: 


Alan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake. After that, watch this Saga Anderson-focused Alan Wake 2 NGT and then check out this Alan Wake-focused NGT. Make sure your PC is ready for Alan Wake 2&#x27;s beefy system requirements, too.

                              <span>If you’ve been curious about The Finals, Embark Studios’ game show-inspired free-to-play shooter, you can sample a taste of the game in an open beta starting tomorrow. First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.</span>

                              <span>Today during Xbox&#x27;s most recent Partner Preview livestream, developer Studio Wildcard showed off its remake of Ark: Survival Evolved, titled Ark: Survival Ascended. And fittingly, it did so by showing off a whole host of dinosaurs.
 We got flying dinos, stalking dinos, and swimming dinos. You&#x27;re hunting dinos, riding dinos, and hanging with dinos. And most notably, it looks great, having been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. 
Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.
The original Ark: Survival Evolved was released back in 2015.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game&#x27;s use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.
While what&#x27;s shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be final as the trailer calls it the &quot;first in-engine look.&quot; Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There&#x27;s nothing pointing toward the game&#x27;s story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today&#x27;s showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you&#x27;d imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today&#x27;s showing:

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview brought us a good look at Still Wakes The Deep, the new game from The Chinese Room, a studio known for projects like Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.
The new project has distinct horror vibes as it drops players into the shoes of a character navigating a ruined oil rig. A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.
The Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.
Nonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.</span>

                              <span>Ikaro Will Not Die is a new game from Powerwash Simulator and Velocity developer Futurlab that made its debut during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. Players presumably control Ikaro, who, as far as we can tell, has one purpose in life: to move really fast and look really cool.
The game is billed as a momentum-based action roguelite, with players zipping around neon-soaked cyberpunk world dishing out rapid melee attacks while executing air dashing and somersaults to evade and outmaneuver enemies. Check out its first trailer below. 


Ikaro Will Not Die doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>The upcoming Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will have its own in-game resort island getaway that plays not too dissimilar from the Animal Crossing games. Happy Resort DonDoko Island was shown off today during Xbox&#x27;s most recent Partner Preview livestream.  
Players will be able to build the island to their liking – including customizing their homes, building infrastructure, and interacting with the island&#x27;s inhabitants. You can see the mode in action below:


While Infinite Wealth is out on January 26, 2024, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has more games up its sleeve. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a bridge between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza: Like A Dragon, is out this year on November 8. Additionally, back in February, the studio released Like a Dragon: Ishin, a remake of the 2014 game Ryu Ga Gotoku: Ishin, which never came to the States.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, &quot;Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.&quot;
Hey, @PlayStation &amp; @cerny, we need to talk!

Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren&#x27;t enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won&#x27;t come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.

                              <span>Starfield hit Xbox Series X/S and PC last month, and it became the biggest Bethesda game launch ever, later earning it the top spot on best-selling games in the U.S. last month. Now, thanks to Microsoft&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financial results, we know more than 11 million players have played Starfield to date. Starfield&#x27;s excellent launch resulted in a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services. However, despite the financial boon on the Xbox services side, overall Xbox hardware was still down 7%. 
That&#x27;s according to Microsoft executive vice president and chief financial officer Amy Hood, who also revealed during the financial results call yesterday that Xbox Game Pass experienced &quot;better-than-expected&quot; subscriber growth; Microsoft did not share any updated Game Pass subscri…</span>

                              <span>Massive SATA SSDs are getting ever more affordable, and this is the best 4TB deal we&#x27;ve ever seen here at RPS. You can get a TeamGroup T-Force Vulcan Z 4TB drive for just $138 at Newegg, down from a previous price of $180. 
In fact, this is half the price of a deal we were eagerly posting about just one year ago, which really speaks to the speed at which SSD storage has collapsed in price in 2023.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLED is my top TV recommendation for PC and console gaming, and the 42-inch and 48-inch versions can even work as PC monitors. Today the 48-inch model has dropped to £824 at Ebay when you use codes BONUS10 and SAVE100OLED, a great price for what is a class-leading 48-inch OLED. For context, this year&#x27;s basically identical 48-inch C3 OLED costs £1100, so you&#x27;re saving nearly £300.

                              <span>A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.
Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below.

                              <span>One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive&#x27;s lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you&#x27;re a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn&#x27;t really verbalise any of this: there&#x27;s no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I&#x27;m being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It&#x27;s a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there&#x27;s difficulty, there&#x27;s rarely frustration.

                              <span>Puzzle game Suika, or &#x27;That Watermelon Game&#x27;, is currently having a bit of a moment online. It&#x27;s been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it&#x27;s taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It&#x27;s also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I&#x27;ve been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It&#x27;s a neat little time waster. It&#x27;s a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it&#x27;s a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you&#x27;re dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it&#x27;s breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I&#x27;d probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I&#x27;m honest.

                              <span>I like to-do list games. Take Wytchwood, where your to-do list is stuff like &#x27;craft trap to catch lizard to use lizard eyes to craft weapon to defeat ghost to...&#x27; and so on. My Little Universe, which is clearly best played in co-op, and would be good to play with kids if you have sourced any of those from somewhere, is like a to-do list game that reduces crafting to the barest minimum. You are basically collecting raw resources and pouring them into a bottomless maw. Despite that description, it&#x27;s quite charming.

Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It&#x27;s short, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines 2 is, much like the wonkily roaded, pollution-choked helltown I’ve built within it, a work in progress. Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have &quot;not achieved the benchmark we targeted&quot; for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

                              <span>Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAAAAAA - Oh, there you are, Snake. This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami&#x27;s stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It&#x27;s this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it&#x27;s a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they&#x27;re fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a mixture of new ideas and RPG systems that go all the way back to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, according to Bethesda&#x27;s former design director Bruce Nesmith, who was lead designer on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and senior designer on Starfield. In particular, Nesmith reckons it will &quot;absolutely&quot; continue with Skyrim&#x27;s approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will &quot;probably&quot; retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.

                              <span>In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.</span>

However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game&#x27;s main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. 
In response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac&#x27;s director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, &quot;Fix is coming for that.&quot; As for when, that remains unclear – a post-launch patch for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 has not yet been released but presumably, when the …</span>

Ahead of a potential U.S. listing, Kim told Reuters that if &#x27;Big Tech&#x27; is serious, &quot;they&#x27;d have to buy us out.&quot; In parallel, Webtoon appears to be quietly laying the groundwork to tackle less-discussed competition; hundreds of pirate sites offering the company&#x27;s content for free.

                              <span>I always love spotting deals on budget mechanical keyboards, as they bring what is - in my mind at least - the single biggest keyboard upgrade available to prices that you can&#x27;t say no to. The LTC Neon75 is far from a big-brand choice, but the keyboard ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to features and design. There are beautiful &#x27;pudding&#x27; keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it&#x27;s available for a 50% off &#x27;overstock&#x27; price on Amazon - that&#x27;s just $35.

                              <span>When I was a kid I sort of hated Frasier. It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

                              <span>Hexworks are making some pretty comprehensive adjustments to fantasy Soulslike RPG Lords of the Fallen, rejigging the AI so that enemies won&#x27;t pursue you quite as far when you run past them, and patching how the New Game Plus options work to give players more control over the difficulty curve. The game&#x27;s latest patch, out now, allows you to choose whether to progress to a harder NG+ setting after finishing a run, or restart at the same difficulty threshold while retaining your character and progression. 


&quot;This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose,&quot; the developers say in Lords of the Fallen&#x27;s latest patch notes. And these are just the first of &quot;some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience&quot;, according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

Take Subpar Pool&#x27;s cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its &#x27;Chonker&#x27;-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they&#x27;re just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it&#x27;s so heartbreaking I can&#x27;t quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games&#x27; previous puzzle game, Holedown.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You&#x27;ve got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There&#x27;s a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she&#x27;s the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I&#x27;m pretty sold on Heartworm, though I&#x27;m still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it&#x27;s a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

                              <span>I know some things aren&#x27;t for me: The sitcom Friends, a small bowl exclusively filled with olives as a side dish, V-neck t-shirts. But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren&#x27;t for me but might be for you.
That&#x27;s because the game&#x27;s relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you&#x27;re rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you&#x27;ve cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you&#x27;re into that, great! If you&#x27;re not, then I&#x27;d slink back into that shadow.

                              <span>Everybody knows some version of the story around Final Fantasy XIV: it came out, it wasn’t very good, it was remade as A Realm Reborn, and now it’s beloved. Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

                              <span>2023&#x27;s mass eradication of the games industry continues with reports of layoffs at Sony Interactive Entertainment and PlayStation Studios. It&#x27;s unclear how extensive these losses are - Sony have yet to provide comment, at the time of writing - but they appear to include staff at PlayStation&#x27;s Visual Arts studio, based in San Diego, which supports developers like The Last of Us creators Naughty Dog and Spider-Man 2 creators Insomniac.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen&#x27;s singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game&#x27;s mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that &quot;it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn&#x27;t great.&quot; Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... &quot;feature-complete&quot; and &quot;into the polishing phase&quot;, meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.


Cloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It&#x27;s a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through &quot;OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson&quot; cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I&#x27;d be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we&#x27;ll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!

                              <span>Back in 2020,  Amazon Studios announced that it was creating a Fallout TV series. Three years after it was announced, we now know that the show will premiere on April 12, 2024. Check out the short announcement teaser below.

As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios&#x27; own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

                              <span>Xbox will debut its new broadcast format, Xbox Partner Preview, this week where we&#x27;ll hear from its third-party partners like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, Remedy Entertainment, Studio Wildcard, and more. This new show will feature more than 20 minutes of trailers and new gameplay footage, and goes live at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25. 
You can watch the Xbox Partner Preview on Xbox-owned channels for a look at games coming to both Xbox and Windows PCs alongside new information about some upcoming Game Pass titles from the company&#x27;s third-party partners. While Microsoft finally completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard earlier this month, Xbox says the Xbox Partner Preview &quot;will not feature any additional news, game reveals, or Game Pass information related&quot; to the deal. 


Xbox says viewers can expect the latest information on in-game activities for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, a launch trailer for Alan Wake 2, the first gameplay for Ark: Survival Ascended, a &quot;dive into the social world of Dungeons of Hinterberg,&quot; and more. 
The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, catch up on Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and then check out our list of every Activision Blizzard game Xbox now owns. Read our thoughts on Alan Wake 2 after going hands on with both an Alan Wake gameplay section and a Saga section.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series&#x27; record-setting trend; 2018&#x27;s Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it&#x27;s off to a strong start regardless.

                              <span>The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018&#x27;s somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series&#x27; creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren&#x27;t sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake&#x27;s Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It&#x27;s far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear&#x27;s past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:

                              <span>The first-person action parkour sub-genre of games is a small but great one. It features the likes of EA’s Mirror’s Edge series, Respawn Entertainment’s Titanfall franchise, and One More Level’s Ghostrunner – one of my fav orite games. I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Notably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform). It&#x27;s on a much larger ma…</span>

                              <span>Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we&#x27;re guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game&#x27;s standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

                              <span>UPDATE 10/20/2023: The recently released Spider-Man 2 is also missing the Chrysler Building. In its place is the same building that replaced it in Spider-Man Miles Morales, though this time with a new coat of paint. 
See below for comparison shots of the Chrysler Building in Spider-Man 1, captured on a base PlayStation 4, and the new building in Spider-Man 2. 
Sony did not respond to our request for comment in time for publish (though it might be safe to assume the reason it gave us three years ago might still be the case here. More on that below).

The original story continues below…
One of New York City&#x27;s most iconic landmarks, the Chrysler Building, was removed for the recent release of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The building was not only featured in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man video g…</span>

                              <span>The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet &amp; Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I&#x27;m disappointed the ones I pulled weren&#x27;t foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

For those who do, a surprise character reveal is one of the last things you’ll see in the post-credits stinger. But it may leave you wondering – who is being teased?
SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE END OF MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN 2.
With Peter and Miles’ big team-up adventure now complete, developer Insomniac Games seems ready to suggest a new spider-powered hero, introducing this universe’s version of Cindy Moon, aka Silk.
Silk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.
