                              <span>From a certain angle, it&#x27;s comfy
Hey there! I was going to be playing MADiSON today, a brand new horror game akin to Visage, as I heard it was released last weekend. Turns out it&#x27;s been pushed til next weekend (hopefully) so today I’m pivoting to... Dark Souls II. I&#x27;ve always said I put it on pause for a rainy day, and today is that day, both metaphorically and literally.

The controls were the hardest part last time I played a few years ago, but I was also a noob. I’m definitely a pro and definitely ready for this now. See you tonight!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

It has taken a while for Nintendo Switch Online to get here with its small-batch, subscription-based rollout, but the Sega Genesis lineup is starting to come into its own. Whereas the N64 additions for Switch Online + Expansion Pack have been solo drops, Sega fans get a few Genesis games at a time, and this week&#x27;s lineup is surprisingly good.
As of June 30, Expansion Pack subscribers can play Comix Zone, Mega Man: The Wily Wars, Target Earth, and Zero Wing on Nintendo Switch. So what&#x27;ll it be? Pain or pleasure?

                              <span>&quot;Extreme&quot; US posters are so great
So I missed the Sonic 2 angry Tails movie poster, and I especially missed that the Japanese version had a more lighthearted happier one. While these types of changes are fairly common, it doesn&#x27;t make it any less funny. Over on Twitter, user whisperwolf brought it to my attention, spotting the differences that I&#x27;m sure a lot of folks had already seen.
Then the comparisons started coming in, calling it a &quot;Kirby moment,&quot; a classic example of a character that gets more lighthearted or serious depending on the region:
https://twitter.com/whisperwoIf/status/1542173257415147522
Another person reminds us of another Sonic 2 angry Tails makeover. The Ristar animation changes, which took the Ristar &quot;serious&quot; boss battle face and plastered it across the entire US version:
https://twitter.com/GnMarxide/status/1542296307854966785
For this particular case, Japan got it right. Tails, by nature, is a free spirit. You can see this trait in pretty much everything he&#x27;s in, from Sonic 2 to the Sonic Boom TV show. Every so often Tails can get down to it and save the day (especially when he needs to step up after a Sonic absence), but his kind heart is what sets him apart from the otherwise stoic and wisecracking cast of friends.
Bet you didn&#x27;t expect a Tails character breakdown this weekend eh? Well, as I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere, it&#x27;s been kind of a rocky week, and my kid and I have been watching a lot of Sonic Boom together!

                              <span>Disco Elysium&#x27;s newest update makes the game more accessible
Disco Elysium is one of my favorite games of all time. I love recommending it to anyone who will listen, but something I forget is just how text-heavy that game is. I&#x27;m an avid reader, but for others, the game&#x27;s script, which clocks in at over a million words, can be pretty intimidating. The good news is, though, that the developers at ZA/UM are well aware of this fact, and have made a bunch of great changes since the game has come out to help make the game accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. Disco Elysium: The Final Cut introduced a fully-voiced experience, but the newest addition is yesterday&#x27;s free update that added dyslexia-friendly fonts.
The font used for most languages is called OpenDyslexic, which was designed to mitigate common reading mistakes that those with dyslexia can make. The great thing is that the font&#x27;s creators made it open source, so that anyone can use it if needed.
In Disco Elysium specifically, OpenDyslexic is used for the English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese-Brazilian, and Polish versions of the game. Other languages have also been accounted for — the Korean version uses a font called Nanum Square Round, while the Russian version uses Adys.
ZA/UM also stated that they&#x27;re still investigating options for both traditional and simplified Chinese.

The devs shared their thoughts in Steam blog post that announced the update: &quot;It’s important, especially for a game with over a million words, that we continue to make improvements to ensure everyone can have the best user experience during their time in Revachol.&quot;
It&#x27;s great to see yet another studio taking down as many barriers to entry as they can -- it feels like the games space is only becoming a more thoughtful and considerate space (for the most part).
The dyslexia-friendly font update is available to download now, wherever you can play Disco Elysium.

                              <span>Many Nintendo fans desperately want a new entry in the popular sci-fi racing series, F-Zero. However, only one diehard fan was reportedly dedicated enough to spend over 5 million yen (roughly $40,000 US) on Nintendo stock, giving him a chance to ask the Japanese publisher about F-Zero and its future directly.

If you wanted a quick recap of the Nintendo Direct Mini announcements, we already gave you one! But life is often a visual medium, and we have the solution right here.
Bam!
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1542870646945976321
To recap, here are a few choice Nintendo Direct Mini announcements:
Persona games coming to Switch
A NieR: Automata port that isn&#x27;t cloud nonsense
The Mega Man Battle Network series lives on again in 2023
In all, it was a pretty fun little Nintendo Direct Mini. A little stressful, I might add, because it all dropped at once with a giant VOD, but once we all got through it together and figured out what was actually new, it was fine. In fact, it was straight-up better and more justified in its existence than a lot of other &quot;Summer of Gaming&quot; streams. Leave it to Nintendo to just casually drive through without a big first-party stream even and crush some of the competition.
I have to admit though, the way Microsoft dropped that conference on us this summer and said &quot;everything announced here is coming out within a year&quot; was pretty baller. A select few of these Switch announcements are likely a ways out, and the &quot;to be released in the future&quot; notations for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are worrying in particular!

                              <span>Nothing Sly going on here
Today, Sucker Punch Productions published a message about its 25 years of games. In the process, it also confirms that no, it&#x27;s not working on a new inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper game.
Sucker Punch says in its message that as its games continue to grow, they require the full attention of the studio. And being that it&#x27;s currently focusing on one project, the studio says it&#x27;s not working on any other one of its properties.
&quot;As our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require the full attention of our studio. With our focus on our current project, we have no plans to revisit inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper right now, and no other studio is currently working on projects related to those franchises either. These characters are very special and near and dear to our hearts, so while we’d never say never to re-opening those doors down the road, for now there are no inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper games in development.&quot;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MlNfJvFnzc8
An inFAMOUS legacy
That pretty much settles that. Sucker Punch does go on to confirm its performing maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC servers, to keep them running a bit longer. They will eventually be sunset, but Sucker Punch says it wants to keep them running &quot;for as long as possible&quot; for players who still want to dip in. The Cole&#x27;s Legacy DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son will also be put up on the PlayStation Store in all territories soon.
It&#x27;s a bit of a strange announcement, though there have been rumors in the past of a return to Sly Cooper revival and the like. This just seems like Sucker Punch getting out ahead of that, as it works on something it says is unrelated to inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper. Sorry to all the fans of thieving animals.

The Blizzard of today is insanely different from the Blizzard of 11 years ago, and this old video of the Blizzard DOTA concept shared on the Heroes of the Storm reddit from the Arkentass YouTube channel proves it.
Embedded below, you can watch footage from BlizzCon 2011, where the team showcased a build of Blizzard DOTA: the MOBA that would eventually be released as Heroes of the Storm four years later. Keep in mind this was back in 2011, when the MOBA genre was still very fresh and League of Legends had barely been out (it was just two years old and Riot wasn&#x27;t quite the empire it is now); and there was some actual MOBA competition going on.

                              <span>New Wing prepares to take Flight. Airplanes.
Long-time publisher Bandai Namco has announced that it has partnered with Japanese studio Ilca to form a brand new development division, monikered Bandai Namco Aces.
&quot;With the recent remarkable growth of the global game market, the demand for more high-end games is increasing,&quot; wrote Bandai Namco Aces on its new website. &quot;On this basis, in order to deliver high-end games that exceed the expectations of fans around the world, we have decided to establish a new company to strengthen our capacities to develop games with hyper-photorealistic expression.&quot;
&quot;Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. has cultivated its expertise in game production through its production of the Tekken series and the Ace Combat series. Ilca has the technical capabilities to produce high-quality content using state-of-the-art technology. Going forward, while leveraging the strengths and know-how of both companies, we will continue to deliver high-quality contents that can be played in-depth and for a long time to fans around the world.&quot;
The Ilca team will lead development in the new division, assisted by its new vice president, Kazutoki Kono. Kono is a veteran producer and director of the popular flight adventure series Ace Combat. And given the &quot;Aces&quot; branding of Bandai Namco&#x27;s new division, one would assume that it is set to be preliminarily focused on the dogfighting series, which is now in its 27th year.
The most recent title in the series, Ace Combat 7, came out in 2019 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. The acclaimed release recently received new content in the form of a Top Gun: Maverick DLC drop.

                              <span>It kicks off on July 11
The Pokemon Sword and Shield wild area is getting a change-up in a little over a week, as The Pokemon Company has announced a new event is on the horizon.
Starting on July 11 at 8:59 JST, Poliwag, Marill, and Spheal will appear in greater number, particularly when it comes to the Wild Area nests: including shiny encounters. The Pokemon Company says it&#x27;s a way to enjoy the &quot;hot summer.&quot; As a note, a lot of folks have been hunting for that shiny Marill, and the green-colored creature is fully confirmed to appear at a 2% rate in five-star raids.
As a reminder, the Sword and Shield Wild Area is periodically changed to suit different events and rotates around a selection of Pokemon. For getting a full &#x27;Dex, it was a really fun experience to dive in and check out different weather patterns and locales for creatures — and helped extend my playthrough of the pair of games quite a bit.
It&#x27;s interesting, because the Sword and Shield Wild Area both feels malleable and static at the same time. If Scarlet and Violet (and future games, really) want to go the route of &quot;everything is the wild area&quot; in the future, it opens up a bit more — but the team likely isn&#x27;t going to completely rework the entire game for little micro-events like this.
While the Wild Area was an experiment of sorts, it ended up becoming one of my favorite elements of any modern Pokemon game.

Fans are flying through Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, and I don&#x27;t blame them — it&#x27;s been a long time coming, and the new bosses are an audio-visual treat, as expected. The urge to burn through the gauntlet and circle back around to improve the grades is high.
That said, it pays to take it slow and appreciate the finer details. One of them, a secret alternate boss phase in the Cuphead DLC, is low-key blowing my mind for a few reasons.
First off, it&#x27;s been a while; I forgot that alternate boss patterns were even on the menu for Cuphead. Naturally, Studio MDHR would carry it forward for The Delicious Last Course, right?
While I&#x27;m not sure what else is lurking out there (I&#x27;ve seen... some stuff, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more), players have discovere…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s based on the Dissidia Final Fantasy NT model
A Kingdom Hearts Cloud mod that brings the KH aesthetic into Final Fantasy VII Remake is something I always needed — and only just got. I mean, it only makes sense with Nomura connected to both!
Crafted by ColossalCake (great name, I could use a colossal cake this weekend) and housed on NexusMods, the Kingdom Hearts Cloud mod is simple and breezy, and swaps the core character model of Cloud for the one featured in Kingdom Hearts. That includes his memorable little infernal wing and red scarf, as well as the extremely Nomura-heavy bandaged sword. As the creator puts it:
&quot;Cloud as redesigned in Kingdom Hearts. I chose to remove his cape however, as there wasn&#x27;t any clean way for it to be supported by the armature. His sword is also mostly the original FFVII:R mesh, with the bandages adapted on top.&quot;

Apparently most of the texture legwork was done by Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, with adjustments done by the modder. At this point, the Final Fantasy VII Remake modding scene has multiple pipelines and paths to success, with mesh importers and modding tools available to help ease the process. It&#x27;s great! You love to see modding communities come together.

After several years, Crypt of the Necrodancer is getting a big update. Brace Yourself Games published the v3.0.0 update for Crypt of the Necrodancer yesterday, June 30.
The studio also shared a blog post about the update, going into more detail about what it adds and why. As it notes, it has been 1,721 days since Crypt of the Necrodancer&#x27;s last update in 2017. As for why the update is happening? I&#x27;ll let Brace Yourself speak for itself:
&quot;Well, let’s just say this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there.&quot;

That&#x27;s certainly good news. But as for the biggest feedback, this update addresses a bunch of quality-of-life a…</span>

A few days ago, our own Noelle Warner shared a piece that rejoiced in her newfound obsession with video game genre mash-ups. While experimenting with genre combinations has long been a celebrated tradition of this industry, there is something about the mashups we’ve seen in recent years that sets them apart from those that emerged in the infancy and adolescence of this medium. Neon White is easily the current poster child for the practice, but past titles like Crypt of the NecroDancer, Battle Chef Brigade, and Yoku’s Island Express show what’s possible when you really think outside the box.
Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is yet another wild combination of two genres, taking age-old shoot ‘em up gameplay and pairing it with the currently popular escape room na…</span>

                              <span>New free playable characters, stages, and relics
Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon refuses to die. The humble puzzle Shovel Knight spin-off is already packed with playable characters and other ways to change up the experience, but the unrelenting teams at Vine and Yacht Club Games won&#x27;t be satisfied until everyone on Earth understands that this game is a blast, and the only way to do that is to coax the global population into trying it. And what better way to do that than with free DLC?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ujvmJ5fA6l8
Starting today on Steam (and coming soon to consoles), the Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon Puzzler&#x27;s Pack DLC is open for business, offering up new playable characters like Mona the alchemist and Puzzle Knight the nogoodnik.
Mona can chain potion explosions for massive combos, and the Puzzle Knight can turn enemies around clockwise to change their overall effect on the battlefield. These unique strategy options are compounded by two new relics, two areas to explore, and new challenges. And this Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon DLC is just the start. Mod support — and the option to refract and enhance your character&#x27;s abilities — are all coming soon.
The team at Yacht Club truly wants Pocket Dungeon to be a game of the people. That&#x27;s why they are opening their discord channel to all comers to discuss what they do and don&#x27;t want in the game. The plan is to keep updating this Puzzle Pack for as long as possible. Remember folks, the original Shovel Knight received massive free updates over the course of five years, so who knows how far they&#x27;ll go. If you want to learn more about them and why they are so unrelentingly giving, check out the 8,000-plus-word interview I did with them in Lock-On 004. As Hot Rod once said, &quot;It&#x27;s a whopper alright!&quot;

                              <span>The New Genesis PlayStation port arrives on August 31, 2022
After over a year with Xbox console exclusivity under its belt, we&#x27;re getting a Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis PlayStation port.
Announced this morning, Sega intends to bring the game to PlayStation 4 on August 31, 2022, which will bring it in line with the PC and Xbox editions of the game. This will include all prior content updates of course, including the recent Kvaris region expansion. Previously the game (which is a more action-oriented spinoff that takes place 1000 years after the PSO 2 proper narrative) launched on June 9, 2021 after a lot of fanfare from Microsoft, but the console exclusivity period is done.
The publisher also confirmed today that it will hold a Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis event at Anime Expo that will honor the whole PSO2 subseries. Here&#x27;s the info:
&quot;In honor of the upcoming launch, SEGA has commissioned one-of-a-kind art that will be displayed all weekend at Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles. The gallery will also feature concept art, figurines, and additional artwork commemorating PSO2&#x27;s recent milestones. There will also be a SEGA photo booth that will transport Anime Expo attendees into the world of PSO2:NGS! Booth visitors will also receive codes to redeem in-game items like ARKS Expo shirts, a mag form, an emote, and a sticker. A limited selection of PSO2: NGS merchandise, including shirts and pins, will be available for purchase; these items are exclusive to Anime Expo and ARKS Expo in Japan.&quot;

Sega provided us with a tease of the Anime Expo New Genesis PlayStation concept art, which you can view in the gallery below!

                              <span>This feels like a marketing move from 2010
Remember roughly 10 years ago, when companies were trying to brainwash people into hating single-player games? It was kind of an awful time for gaming, full of &quot;Project 10 Dollar&quot; chicanery (when publishers would put $10 passes in their games to launch content, to avoid used game sales), copious on-disc DLC, and forced multiplayer that sometimes shut down mere months after launch. Well, this EA single-player games tweet brings me back to all that:
https://twitter.com/EA/status/1542652454159798272
Bad idea to tweet this in 2022, right? Not to mention the entire vibe of the tweet (which is taken from a TikTok trend) feels like a joke from a decade ago? So like, I kinda get someone making the call (whether it was higher up or not) to make an out-of-touch tweet like that: at another studio, if that. But EA literally has had a bad history with dunking on single-player games, and is actively making some now, like the Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. This was exacerbated by Vince Zampella (who helps run the studio that makes the Fallen Order series) tweeting out a &quot;man facepalming&quot; emoji in direct response.
Things got a lot tenser, too, as Zach Mumbach, a former EA/Visceral Games employee (the studio of Dead Space fame, among many other games like Dante&#x27;s Inferno), stated that &quot;this is the company that shut down my studio and laid off ~100 great developers because we were making a single-player game.&quot; They were likely referring to Visceral&#x27;s Star Wars game. Someone else tweeted out a list of games and IP that went to EA to essentially die.
Eventually, EA admitted defeat:
https://twitter.com/EA/status/1542706383694565378
But the damage was already done. Users reminisced about the publisher&#x27;s various deeds, and former and current employees mused on how volatile it can be to work for EA. It just goes to show you: not every meme trend is worth chasing, especially if you&#x27;re a brand.

                              <span>A nice place to visit, but you wouldn&#x27;t wanna die there
Bethesda Softworks, in association with developer Arkane Studios, has dropped a fresh trailer for its upcoming co-op shooter Redfall, which remains currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.
The video focuses on both the titular monster-ridden city, as well as the posse of protagonists bringing their superheroic ways to the blood-soaked streets — aiming to clean the city of vampires, zombies, and other unholy creatures of the undead. In the preview, we meet inventor Remi De La Rosa, hunter extraordinaire Devinder Crousley, the trigger-happy Jacob Boyer, and the telepath Layla Ellison, all of whom sound as if they were named by NXT development.

Blending seamless single and multiplayer options, Redfall will allow players to choose and customize their character as best fits the battle, making adjustments for loadouts, skills, and special abilities. By forming strong, synergized builds with your fellow teammates, the four heroes will offer a threat to the huge number of bad beasties that wait within the parks, buildings, restaurants, and tourist traps of this once quaint community.
With large open-world areas, a dazzling array of makeshift weaponry, and oodles of style and charisma, Redfall hopes to capture the co-op horror market on release, offering an alternate to some of the team-shooter titles currently available in the genre. While the development team was unfortunately forced to delay the title to allow for extra polish to the &quot;ambitious&quot; release, Redfall is now expected to launch in early 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Go west, young horse
This Zelda: Breath of the Wild horse video helped patch up what has ostensibly been a rough week for me, in true Breath of the Wild fashion.
Shared by u_guessed on Reddit, the clip takes a quick and hilarious turn after Link attempts to call back his horse on a riverbank. He whistles...and...nope! The horse immediately turns around, and starts swimming away. Cold as ice.
It&#x27;s a fine line, this sort of stuff, but Zelda: Breath of the Wild generally makes things easy to come back from. In other open-world games, the &quot;emergent&quot; gameplay can often lead to game-breaking bugs or frustration. And Breath of the Wild has some of that, to be sure!
But I encountered my fair share of good quirks like this, enough to even help carry multiple playthroughs. If my horse did this in-game, I&#x27;d have to put the controller down to have a good laugh. It&#x27;s just perfect: the speed and cadence in which it peaces out.
I know five years on, folks are a little tired of Breath of the Wild still being in the zeitgeist, but I know a lot of people still get a kick out of it, or even still play it! I salute you all.

                              <span>There&#x27;s water type and Pikachu charm merch too
Today, Japan announced several new menu items coming to the Pokemon Cafe (and Pikachu Sweets window), including both food and drink change-ups.
Let&#x27;s go with the food first: the chain is adding a Pikachu BBQ curry plate, &quot;inspired by Pikachu&#x27;s summer vacation.&quot; Locations offer up &quot;three different facial expressions&quot; for the dish. Then there&#x27;s &quot;Eevee&#x27;s Mineko Ala Mode,&quot; which is a set of side dishes focused on sweets (like cookies and wafers).
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;332843,332845,332844,332846&quot;]
Next up is the Pokemon Cafe drink alterations, and I&#x27;m feeling refreshed just looking at it. The cafe is adding a frozen peach drink, with optional water-type accessories to buy: including a charm straw.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;332847,332848,332849,332850,332851&quot;]
All of this (including the new Pokemon Cafe drink) will be arriving with the menu changes coming on July 16, amid the additional menu items coming on July 9 based on the first generation starters. Note that there are two Pokemon Cafe locations: one in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, and another in Shinsaibashi, Osaka. You can find the addresses for both on the bottom of the cafe&#x27;s FAQ page.
One of my favorite pastimes is watching food bloggers on YouTube specifically for Japanese cafes and theme park promos. Can you tell I miss Japan?

Yesterday, we reported on how Cory Barlog, producer of the upcoming God of War Ragnarok, asked the community for &quot;patience&quot; in their wait for release date news. Sadly, matters only escalated, encouraging Barlog to return to social media asking for — of all basic necessities — &quot;human decency.&quot; Vidya Gamez.
Barlog&#x27;s comments came after a fresh surge of fan outrage when June 30 did not result in the (purely rumored) release date reveal for the highly anticipated sequel. Among a litany of complaints, tantrums, and outright threats, one of Ragnarok&#x27;s developers actually received explicit images in their inbox, along with yet another demand for the title&#x27;s release date.

So just this past week, we caught you up to speed on the sudden development that Proletariat, the studio behind Spellbreak, would be acquired by Blizzard. It came directly after the team announced that they would be closing down Spellbreak for good, and it seems like Blizzard is already following the same acquisition playbook as Microsoft — the company they&#x27;re about to join themselves within the next year. Now we have a bit more info as to what that World of Warcraft Proletariat configuration actually means.
As detailed by Warcraft general manager John Hight in a new Blizzard blog, Proletariat will indeed be supporting the MMO going forward, as the deal has officially closed as of today. Hight says that the plan is to…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s about $15 a year
A Switch repair has popped up in Japan, and it&#x27;s officially endorsed by Nintendo. For roughly $15 USD a year (or about $1.5 a month), you can join up.
Nintendo is calling the service &quot;Wide Care,&quot; and it&#x27;s available on their official site directly. They describe it as &quot;a repair warranty service that can solve such problems. We guarantee a wide range of failures such as natural failures, failures due to getting wet, and damage due to dropping.&quot; Hilariously, one of the incidents described on the page trying to get you to subscribe involves being worried that your kid will drop your Switch outside.
It seems to actually be &quot;wide&#x27; as advertised, and will cover most repairs, with the catch that you get six uses per year. Shipping is covered, and the Switch Lite is covered (though not separate Joy-Con or the dock if you just own a Switch Lite, which makes sense as the Lite doesn&#x27;t come with either accessory). You can find all of the details on the main page, or below:

This is just the latest in a long line of Switch repair services to help Nintendo stave off current and future lawsuits dealing with the state of Joy-Con controllers. Remember that in the US at least, the company is still offering free Joy-Con repairs.

Well, I called it — back when I reviewed Nexon&#x27;s awesomely fun fighter DNF Duel earlier this week, I distinctly noted that I expected 20 infinite combos to drop within week one, and it seems that a whole host of &#x27;em were found by Day Two, with the holy warrior Crusader being the worst offender.
In videos spreading throughout the FGC like wildfire, the gospel-lovin&#x27; bone-breaker has demonstrated his utterly ridiculous touch-of-death combo, one that can essentially be repeated until the opponent is no more, with no window to break (hence &quot;infinite&quot;). What&#x27;s more, while many fighting game infinites are usually very circumstantial, the Crusader combo can be pulled off with relative ease. As long as he has a dot of conversion and decent Mana,…</span>

                              <span>Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

                              <span>We’ll be playing matches in Overwatch 2’s second beta today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central. Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?
Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!
Watch on Twitch!

                              <span>Microsoft, the company that brought us furry Sonic controllers and a Far Cry 6 console that resembled a bomb, has unveiled its latest kooky Xbox Series X sweepstakes, and it may be the coolest/dumbest one yet.
Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It&#x27;s hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.</span>

                              <span>Sucker Punch Productions, the studio behind 2020’s hit new IP Ghost of Tsushima, has revealed it is not working on anything related to its previous Infamous and Sly Cooper franchises. The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

                              <span>With my review last month of the HP Dev One laptop powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U and running Pop!_OS I benchmarked it against various laptops I had locally with both AMD and Intel CPUs, including the likes of the very common Tiger Lake SoCs. At the time I hadn&#x27;t any newer Alder Lake P laptops but now with a Core i7 1280P laptop in hand, here is a look at how that AMD Cezanne Linux laptop can compete with Intel&#x27;s brand new Alder Lake P SoCs with the flagship Core i7 1280P.</span>

With long-running rumours of a GoldenEye 007 re-release coming soon (pah, &#x27;soon&#x27; my Aston!), we&#x27;ve once again been thinking about Rare&#x27;s seminal N64 shooter. Mention &#x27;James Bond&#x27; and &#x27;games&#x27; in the same sentence and gamers of a certain age will get a faraway look in their (golden)eye as they recall crawling through vents into the gents in Facility or taking out security cameras with a PP7 in the Severnaya Bunker. Good times.
However, the games that carry the name of the world&#x27;s least secret agent have been many and varied, with winners like Everything or Nothing, the underrated World is Not Enough, and a bunch more appearing on Nintendo consoles. 007 might have been quiet for a while — since 2012&#x27;s 007 Legends, in fact — but we count 20 James Bond games released for Nintendo platforms over the years.

One of the games we&#x27;re most excited about this summer is Cult of the Lamb, a gory-cute simulator that&#x27;s a bit like if Animal Crossing went totally off the rails, and was about forest critter Satanists instead of forest critter capitalists.
Ahead of the game&#x27;s August 11th release date, a new trailer has just gone live, showing the tips and tricks you&#x27;ll need to make your own cult. Turns out that a lot of it is based around kissing and bribing, which is good to know.

Another roguelite deckbuilder is on the way, and this one is being published by KEMCO, with old-school JRPG-style art — picture Castlevania-meets-Final Fantasy-meets Slay The Spire. It&#x27;s called Overrogue, and it&#x27;s all about working your way up to the grand title of Overlord by making your way through dungeons and labyrinths, overpowering monsters, and of course, playing lots of cards.
Here&#x27;s the blurb, which gives you an idea of how many card combinations exist in the game:

Part visual novel, part strategy RPG, Digimon Survive is all about uncovering mysteries, interacting and making friends with Digimon, and surviving. Trapped on a mysterious island, you can explore to talk to people and search for clues by selecting an area on the world map.

Born out of a game on Tiktok, They&#x27;re a 10 but is meant to be a lighthearted joke where you bring up one flaw about someone who is otherwise perfect. All in good faith of course — no one real!
Gaming giant EA decided to join in on the joke in a way that ruffled many people&#x27;s feathers, VGC reports. The developer shared its take on the joke early this morning, and it was quickly met with ire.

                              <span>It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re back in 1998 all over again.
Last month, the internet was set alight with the news that Capcom&#x27;s iconic Resident Evil 4 would be receiving the remake treatment (after a few leaks, mind!) with the stunning RE Engine. That particular game isn&#x27;t coming to Switch sadly (though we&#x27;ll remain optimistic for whatever the consoles successor will bring), so unfortunately we won&#x27;t be experiencing the likes of Ramon Salazar in glorious next-gen graphics on Nintendo&#x27;s system. We&#x27;ll keep dreaming though!
One fan on Twitter, however, has gone in the complete opposite direction by commencing work on a Resident Evil 4 &quot;DEmake&quot;, effectively taking the characters and environments from the fourth mainline entry and bringing the visuals in line with Resident Evil 2. Complete with static camera angles and an animated loading screen, the resulting presentation is incredibly convincing! The area in question looks like the underground walkway that directly precedes the first cinematic encounter with Bitores &quot;Big Cheese&quot; Mendez.

                              <span>Wright &#x27;em up.
We didn’t quite know what we were getting ourselves into when we agreed to review Yurukill: The Calumniation Games. On one hand, Yurukill fronts as a murder-mystery adventure similar to Danganronpa or – if you squint hard enough – Phoenix Wright. On the other, Yurukill also throws at you some shoot ‘em up segments that seem thematically unrelated. Finding clues and reading through line after line of dramatic dialogue before shooting down hordes of enemy ships to an electronic beat seems to go together about as well as pickles on ice cream, yet somehow developer IzanagiGames (along with shmup dev G.Rev) pulls off this bizarre mixture way better than we thought possible.
Yurukill begins with Sengoku Shunju waking up on a prison ferry on its way to Yurukill Land – an amusement park filled with murder-themed attractions. Joining him are five other prisoners, including a foul-mouthed biker and his straight-laced twin brother, a snobbish rich kid, a peppy teenage idol, and a bumbling detective. Prior to finding themselves on their way to Yurukill Land, all of them were convicted of some crime or other. Sengoku, for example, was sentenced to 999 years in prison for causing nearly two dozen deaths by burning down an entire apartment building.

What&#x27;s the best part of Mario Paint? No, not the painting! The Composer mode! Who didn&#x27;t spend hours on Mario Paint making tunes with fire flowers, mushrooms, coins, and boos?
Mario Paint Composer has become something of an online hit in the years since the SNES game&#x27;s release, with many budding musicians picking up their SNES mouse and creating tunes of their favourite songs and video game tracks. There have also been plenty of downloadable versions and variants of Composer over the years. But, thanks to a tip from reader Erik, we&#x27;ve been pointed in the direction of a browser-based version.

It&#x27;s no secret that the Switch - or more specifically the Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers - have been subject to a number of faults of the years. Perhaps most infamously known for the dreaded drift, the Joy-Con controllers have been a source of pain for gamers the world over, with many opting for the much more reliable Pro Controller for their everyday needs.
It seems Nintendo is finally looking to provide a meaningful service to tackle such issues and has launched a subscription service in Japan to aid customers requiring Switch repairs. As reported by VGC, the service is known as &#x27;Wide Care&#x27; and will cost consumers 200 yen per month (roughly $1.50/£1.20) or 2000 yen per year ($15/£12).

Metroidvania FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch is launching on the Switch eShop later this month, but fans have also been promised a physical edition of the game from publisher Microids. Now we know that the boxed version of the game will be making the jump just a few months later, on 6th September.
Gematsu reports that the physical edition comes with a steelbook, a digital download for a soundtrack, a sticker sheet, and three lithograph prints. Developed by Shanghai-based studio TiGames, this port — and the physical edition — has been a long time coming for Switch owners. PlayStation fans won&#x27;t be missing out on the physical version either, which drops on the same day.

Many of us were pleasantly surprised when Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes was announced for the Switch. Instead of making a direct sequel to the original Fire Emblem Warriors, we got a Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity situation with a focus on the most recent Fire Emblem title and characters, Three Houses. But it wasn&#x27;t always going to be that way.
In a recent interview with the Japanese magazine Nintendo Dream, the game&#x27;s development producer, producer, and director — Hideo Suzuki, Yosuke Hayashi, and Hayato Iwata respectively — revealed that the team originally planned to make a direct sequel. In this segment of the interview, translated by Nintendo Everything, Hayashi shared that this &quot;placeholder name&quot; was chosen because of the team&#x27;s desire for a sequel.

Update : Yesterday, VGC had a story about a Nintendo shareholder who asked the company if they had any plans to revive past IPs such as the futuristic racing series F-Zero, the RPG Baten Kaitos, and various other titles like Wario Land.
It turns out this question didn&#x27;t come cheap. Speaking to Business Insider, the individual known as &#x27;Momiji&#x27; on social media, revealed how he spent over 5.6 million Japanese yen (over $40,000 USD) on Nintendo stock just to ask Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa the question during the company&#x27;s latest shareholder meeting.

Earlier in June, not long after the release of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, players discovered a bug in the game preventing them from completing it.
As described by a player on social media at the time, a game crash would occur after the Basilisk Crash cutscene when landing on Onderon. Aspyr at the time said it was &quot;aware&quot; of this issue, and advised players to resort to a warp cheat in order to proceed past this point.

                              <span>The Tour De France, the grandest race in professional cycling, started today. Across three weeks, 176 cyclists will ride 3328 kilometres (2068 miles) winding through France, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland, including the Alps and Pyrenees. As a keen cyclist and avid Tour watcher myself, I&#x27;m excited. So in celebration, over the coming weeks I&#x27;ll be gabbing about the Tour De France, cycling, and bikes in a wide variety of video games with my own Tour De Jeux, from big-budget open-world extravaganzas to cute wee indie adventures. Let&#x27;s start in the obvious place: the official Tour De France video game.

I&#x27;ve nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

                              <span>I’m contractually obligated to inform you of the best early Prime Day deals on PC gaming hardware, even though Prime Day 2022 isn’t until July 12th. Aaaaand then continues over until June 13th. Jeff, lad, that’s two Prime Days. Regardless, Amazon’s Prime Day landing page is already a gateway into some decent discounts on peripherals, SSDs, gaming monitors and the like, so take a look if you’re of a more urgent mind. Unlike the bulk of actual Prime Day deals, the ones you’ll find listed here don’t even need an Amazon Prime account to access.
Previous Prime Days have driven competing retailers to knock down some of their own prices, and this year looks to be no different, so I’ve included some good sales from non-Amazon retailers as well. For the 12th and 13th we’ll also post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide (like last year&#x27;s), so you can still make some savings even if you’re avoiding Amazon specifically.

                              <span>The arrival of Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion has brought a swathe of quality of life improvements to Capcom&#x27;s beast-bashing action game, including support for Nvidia&#x27;s performance-boosting DLSS tech. Announced earlier this week as part of the game&#x27;s 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone&#x27;s hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that&#x27;s not exactly ideal.

Little Kitty Big City will see you wearing the whiskers of a cat less concerned with going home than it is with wreaking urban havoc. But what if you don&#x27;t want to wait for these games?

In addition to, or perhaps instead of, anime openers, I put it to you that more games should celebrate their launch days with live action music videos - and after watching Capcom&#x27;s freshly unveiled &quot;Matsuken Sunbreak&quot; vid for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, I think you&#x27;ll heartily agree.

                              <span>Yesterday tech journalist Alex Hern, who has been making comparatively gentle fun of the crypto crash, pointed out that he didn&#x27;t Tweet about bitcoin in the boom times &quot;because it wasn&#x27;t funny then.&quot; So, after we posted yesterday about a crypto fan who very shoddily stole Itch and for some reason tagged Itch&#x27;s founder in a tweet about it, allow me to bring you the news that some No Man&#x27;s Sky players have come up with what I think is the most useful application of a crypto currency I&#x27;ve seen. And it works because it is deliberately valueless.

A free update yesterday added the option to display text in fonts which are intended to be easier to read for some people with dyslexia. The popular OpenDyslexic typeface is used for many languages, while Russian and Korean have their own fonts. I have a touch of the ol&#x27; dyslexia myself and do find this font helps me a bit.

                              <span>Adapting an established property in any medium has got to be a pretty tricky proposition. Satisfying the long term fans while keeping things approachable for newcomers on top of, well, making a good game. Add in the complexities of making a turn-based game based on an existing turn-based game and it’s surprising that developers don’t just collapse into gibbering, tentacle-waving Chaos Spawn.


Complex Games, the developers of recent XCOM-like Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters not only managed to resist the mutating power of the Warp, but produced an absolute cracker of a game. Suspecting pacts with Dark Powers were behind it, I put on my big Inquisitorial hat and set off to question Noah Decter-Jackson, the game’s Creative Director.

The first full expansion since Cottage Living launched a year ago, High School Years is set to do exactly what it says on the tin, massively expanding gameplay options for Sims in their teens.
The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there&#x27;s a fair bit of overlap with the series&#x27; established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that&#x27;s been on the fandom&#x27;s collective wish list for a very long time.

The campaign co-op network test for Halo Infinite is right around the corner. 343 Industries confirms today that a test period for online campaign co-op in Halo Infinite will run from July 11 through 22.
Previously announced as arriving this month, 343 confirms the test will run for that period of time for Insiders. There&#x27;s another feature on the way, too.
In a Halo Waypoint blog, the studio also confirms Mission Replay will arrive alongside the network campaign co-op update. This will let players replay old missions right from the Tac-Map. Halo Infinite lead world designer John Mulkey cites the open nature of Infinite causing problems for this initially, but the update will let Solo or Co-Op players select any completed mission, alongside d…</span>

                              <span>Putting your hand in the TV might get too realistic
Sega is looking into doing more film and TV, and it&#x27;s eyeing properties under the Atlus umbrella. A new story indicates Sega is digging into the Atlus catalog for potential live-action film and TV adaptations.
Speaking to IGN, Sega says it is currently exploring live-action film and TV projects with various studios and producers. Toru Nakahara—producer on the Sonic the Hedgehog movies—says Sega is exploring the idea, specifically pointing towards the Persona franchise.
&quot;Atlus&#x27; worlds are filled with high drama, cutting-edge style and compelling characters,&quot; said Nakahara. &quot;Stories like those from the Persona franchise really resonate with our fans and we see an opportunity to expand the lore like no one has seen—or played—before.
&quot;Together, Sega and Atlus, are working to bring these stories and worlds to life through new mediums and for new audiences,&quot; Nakahara says.

Sky&#x27;s the limit
Sega didn&#x27;t specify any production companies in particular to IGN. It&#x27;s only interested in exploring potential projects with various studios and producers at the moment.
It&#x27;s not like Persona hasn&#x27;t been adapted before, though mostly through animated series and OVAs. But making it with human actors could get a little weird.
While The Witcher and other series have moved into the corporeal realm with solid results, anime-styled adaptations haven&#x27;t always fared so well. Look at Netflix&#x27;s Death Note if you need an example.
Still, video game adaptations continue to be all the rage. Sega has done pretty well with the live-action Sonic movies so far, so there&#x27;s some earned lee-way in experimenting a bit. Just uh, please don&#x27;t make a live-action Teddy. The world isn&#x27;t ready yet.

Atari, (or at least the current iteration of Atari), has announced that it will be releasing an ambitious new compilation that hopes to capture the 50-year history of the legendary game developer. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration will look back at Atari&#x27;s five decades in gaming, dating all the way back to the birth of the industry itself.
We cannot think of a better way to celebrate our golden anniversary than to share the decades of fun, innovation, and talent with our fans worldwide through this truly remarkable collection,&quot; said Atari CEO Wade Rosen. &quot;To say it’s an honor to bring this collection to life is an understatement.

Return to Monkey Island was showcased on Tuesday, during the Nintendo Direct Mini showcase. It was an exciting gameplay reveal for the newest entry. But not long after, Monkey Island writer and director Ron Gilbert announced he was shutting down comments on his personal site.
Gilbert&#x27;s personal blog Grumpy Gamer has been a repository for his writing, thoughts, and an occasional April Fools&#x27; actual-announcement. Despite all that, after revealing Return to Monkey Island gameplay during the Direct, comments flooded into the blog. Angry, mean ones.

                              <span>Full trilogy headed to Xbox One and Xbox Series X
Inti Creates has announced that the Azure Striker Gunvolt trilogy is headed to Xbox platforms over the coming months. The first title in the hyper-kinetic series will be available to purchase on Xbox One and Xbox Series X today, with its two sequels scheduled to roll out over the summer.
Already available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a fast-paced and highly electrifying platform adventure that found fame as a Nintendo 3DS release way back in 2014. It tells a tale of a highly-skilled, superpowered mercenary, (the titular Gunvolt), who embarks on a mission to eliminate a squad of equally skilled special agents, guided by their mysterious musical muse, Lumen.

Of course, this simple premise merely sets the stage for a dramatic tale of love, loss, revenge, and redemption — set alongside action-packed retro-infused gameplay. This popular release would be followed up by Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 in 2016, which continued the story while offering improved gameplay and other dynamic features. A second sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, is in its final production stages, with a release date scheduled for just a few weeks from now.
Azure Striker Gunvolt is available now on Xbox platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 will launch on July 14, while Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 will arrive on August 2, five days after its 28 July Switch date. The first two titles are already available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch via the Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack.

                              <span>Sabotage&#x27;s RPG is taking some extra time
Sea of Stars is charting a course for next year, rather than this one. Sabotage Studio announced today that Sea of Stars will now release in 2023.
The retro-style RPG was revealed in 2020 as the next project from Sabotage, the team behind The Messenger. Sea of Stars was set for a holiday 2022 launch during an Indie World Showcase last December, but now it&#x27;s aiming a bit further beyond.
&quot;Keeping in mind our two main priorities—quality of life for our team and quality of the finished game—we can now confirm that Sea of Stars will be released in 2023,&quot; today&#x27;s statement reads.
It&#x27;s not all bad news for patient fans, though. Sabotage thanks the community for its support and closes off with a note that it&#x27;s looking into options for getting a &quot;playable slice&quot; of Sea of Stars out to everyone this year.

Sea full of stars
It might be a bummer, but Sea of Stars does seem like it&#x27;s coming together pretty darn well. Even back in our first look at the project, it was a really cool blend of classic ideas and modern design, like a love letter to the likes of Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.
For the team&#x27;s health and for the game&#x27;s benefit, a little extra wait is a good thing. Considering how well The Messenger came together, I&#x27;ve got high hopes for Sea of Stars.
It&#x27;s not like 2022 is hurting for RPGs either. Just in July, two big games are launching in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and the HD-2D remake of Live A Live. Plus, the newly announced Crisis Core remaster is also aiming for this winter. We&#x27;ve got plenty to play while we wait for Sea of Stars to arrive in 2023.

And even better, you’ll be able to replay missions from the campaign, too. However, here’s the bad news: This is a limited-time test of only 10 days. And you’ll need to restart the entire campaign…

                              <span>Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment&#x27;s newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I&#x27;m hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game&#x27;s first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack&#x27;s thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don&#x27;t have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a &quot;punker granny&quot; or a &quot;famous streamer&quot; with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it&#x27;s difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.</span>

                              <span>As previously promised, Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op takes its first steps towards launch, thanks to a network beta flight scheduled for July.  
Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version. 
In a Halo Waypoint blog post, 343 lead software engineer Isaac Bender and lead world designer John Mulkey discussed the co-op mode’s feat…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ll soon have the chance to play EA&#x27;s highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this &quot;insider&quot; program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title &quot;Still working on it.&quot; The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series&#x27; skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it&#x27;s going to be a blast.</span>

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…</span>

                              <span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is getting an expansion called Trials of the Dragon King. The DLC includes new gear, jobs, and enemies to fight. Check out the short trailer below; it&#x27;s as deliciously chaotic as you&#x27;d expect. 
There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it&#x27;s hard to parse through what&#x27;s happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, &quot;You will die here, and I will live forever.&quot; We&#x27;re sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, &quot;Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that&#x27;s a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it&#x27;s all about combat and little else.&quot;
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title&#x27;s latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn&#x27;t have the power of Roadhog&#x27;s but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we&#x27;re also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You&#x27;ll just have to watch for yourself to find out!</span>

As spotted by an eagle-eyed Redditor, the MegaCrit Twitter account has edited their bio to add the message &quot;Working on our next game!&quot; It&#x27;s hardly surprising, given that Slay The Spire came out in early access in 2017, and then as an official release in 2019, but it&#x27;s always nice to get confirmation.
Before now, the most information we had on MegaCrit&#x27;s next output was that it wouldn&#x27;t be Slay The Spire-related, and that they were &quot;working on things&quot;, including a not-yet-released Slay The Spire board game. We still don&#x27;t know much more, except that it&#x27;s definitely a game.

We regret to inform you that 2022 is half over. You might as well just start buying your Christmas presents now, folks, because from here it&#x27;s a slippery slope to Winter. But before that happens, let&#x27;s celebrate the six-month mark of 2022 with our games of the year so far, or GOTYSF!
The list is stacked this year, with Pokémons and Ninja Turtles and Kirbies, so we had a little discussion between the NL team about our picks for GOTYSF, but if you want to skip straight to the poll to have your say (how could you) then it&#x27;s right at the bottom. But the words are good too. You should read them anyway.

Did you miss the big Persona news this week? Well, we have something pretty good to tell you! Persona 5 Royal, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 3 Portable are all coming to the Switch.
Starting in October, Persona 5 Royal will be staging a Take Over on the Switch, with Persona 4 and 3 following in 2023. Many of these characters have already made appearances on both the 3DS and Switch before in Persona Q, Persona Q2, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and Persona 5 Strikers. And 5&#x27;s protagonist Joker famously became the first DLC character for the first Fighters Pass for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. To say this has been a long time coming is an understatement.

Negotiations are now underway to end this dispute but it appears that can only be achieved if the court agrees to modify the injunction, which was previously described as a &quot;power grab&quot;.

If wanting to run Coreboot on a system today it basically means running a Google Chromebook, using an outdated server motherboard or old Lenovo ThinkPad that has seen a Coreboot port, or out of reach to most individuals are various server motherboards that are reference platforms or board designs from hyperscalers. But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their &quot;Dasharo&quot; downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard. I&#x27;ve been trying this out and it has worked out surprisingly well. Here are my experiences and benchmarks of Coreboot/Dasharo on this Intel Alder Lake motherboard.</span>

                              <span>Let’s face facts: the old Sonic games have been re-released more times than I’ve had hot dinners. And every single Sonic fan has bought every single one of them, such is our sheer madness. We’re a little spoiled on PC for Sonic content these days, with every recent game of note having its own PC port that’s immediately been modded from bottom to breakfast. But it wasn’t always this simple, oh no. It used to be pretty slim pickings for us Sonicsters, and I’m here to tell you what we fought through to get to the promised land of ports we bask in today.

Dubbed &#x27;W3itch.io&#x27;, the copycat site&#x27;s creator replied to a tweet from Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran, who promptly asked them not to &quot;rip off&quot; Itch.io anymore. W3itch.io even described itself as a “free-as-freedom open marketplace for independent game creators inspired by Itch and Gitcoin”. Not the most sensible of ideas to engage with the person whose work you’re replicating, W3itch.io.

Hailing from designer Terry Cavanagh, the DLC gives each of the base game’s six contestants an episode with “wildly new designs and rules”, the devs say. Play through all the episodes and you should get another 4 to 5 hours out of the game. Watch the trailer below for a looksee.

                              <span>A few years back, Pip enjoyed Hook, a minimalist puzzle game about untangling mish-mashes of hooks and pins by removing pieces in the correct order. If you try to remove that one, the hook will snag on that pin, so first this pin needs to go but ah! that goes through the middle of this ring, so... it&#x27;s interesting to understand a shape and system so you can pull it to pieces. Now a sequel is out, and it&#x27;s also nice, and it&#x27;s under £2, and it has a demo too.

                              <span>Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

While no longer there to view, VGC managed to capture Gilbert’s post on grumpygamer.com before the site became unavailable. You can see the new art style for yourself in the trailer below.

                              <span>Against all possible odds, we&#x27;re officially halfway through 2022. What a year it&#x27;s been so far! After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I&#x27;ve started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I&#x27;ve played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you&#x27;ll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it&#x27;s done ours. I&#x27;ll warn you now, though. It&#x27;s a big list.

                              <span>Video game parodies are often ropey, being neither funny nor fun to play. I am delighted that The Looker is both, and free too. It&#x27;s a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it&#x27;s only an hour or two to complete.

The DLC adds a new character, Ms. Chalice, the third beverage-container bonce you can play as. Once you’ve unlocked her in the DLC you’ll be able to play as her in the base game too. There&#x27;s also a new island with mountains, icy tundra and desert to navigate. Watch the trailer below, although it’s getting on a bit now.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t until I played a hands-on preview of Cult Of The Lamb this weekend that I realised how much ovine imagery is knocking around Christianity. All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

                              <span>Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there&#x27;s no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve&#x27;s added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

                              <span>Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&amp;2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn&#x27;t going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, &quot;How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Yes, please. I&#x27;d very much like that. Give it to me now.&quot; Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You&#x27;ll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you&#x27;ll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We&#x27;re not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it&#x27;s slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.</span>

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game&#x27;s associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle&#x27;s success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike. 
&quot;We were particularly happy by the fact that we saw many players who were not too used to the tacti…</span>

                              <span>Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game&#x27;s narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what&#x27;s to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean&#x27;s characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond&#x27;s campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

More specifically, Fallen Angel will hit Switch on July 19, meaning there’s already less than a month left until you can take the archangel experience with you on the go. If you aren’t familiar with Fallen Angel, you can get a look at what awaits you in it in the special Switch announcement trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there are a lot of hellacious things going on, which makes sense considering you control Lucifer as he attempts to ascend from hell to get revenge on those who banished him from heaven.

                              <span>Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

                              <span>With Atari&#x27;s 50th anniversary happening this week, the company has revealed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we&#x27;ve seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry. I went hands-on with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration to see how well it accomplishes that lofty goal.
At its core, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration delivers more than 90 playable games in one $40 package. Players can expect classic and retro titles from six hardware platforms (Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, ST, Jaguar, and Lynx), all with emulation created by renowned re…</span>

                              <span>You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions &amp; Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions &amp; Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions &amp; Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions &amp; Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”</span>

                              <span>Survival horror slash ‘em up Dead By Daylight’s progression and perks systems are being overhauled to dramatically reduce the amount of grind, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced. The changes to Dead By Daylight’s progression and perks were first touted during the grindhouse game’s sixth anniversary broadcast back in May, but are finally arriving in the mid-chapter update for the current ‘Roots Of Dread’ storyline in July.

                              <span>When action-adventure game Hell Is Us was first announced a couple of months ago, we thought it had Annihilation vibes and appreciated the team&#x27;s attempts to invoke Annihilation... and its vibes. Developers Rogue Factor didn&#x27;t provide many other details, besides a few buzz words: &quot;semi-open world&quot;, &quot;true adventure&quot;, &quot;third person&quot;.
So, I sat down with the game&#x27;s creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a &quot;true adventure&quot;. Lo and behold, I think it worked!

Metaphorical alarm bells began ringing earlier this week when it emerged that Fntastic are composed entirely of “volunteers” – although full-time volunteers, kindly dubbed &quot;employees&quot; in the statement, do receive salaries.

                              <span>I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

Please tell me David Lynch will at least direct the pilot.

Announced yesterday, the rhythm game will tell the tale of teen girl who goes from playing air guitar on a broom to wailing on the world stage. Loud looks cute, somewhere between Life Is Strange and Guitar Hero, and you can see a bit in the trailer below.

Hlavní novinkou je podpora nové verze skriptovacího jazyka Vim9 Script, který má zásadně zlepšit výkon editoru. Je to zajištěno kompilací skriptů do instrukcí, které mohou být prováděny velmi rychle. Výsledkem by mělo být desetinásobné až stonásobné zrychlení.</span>

                              <span>The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.</span>

                              <span>Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he&#x27;s unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham&#x27;s thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He&#x27;s also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.</span>

                              <span>Over the last 31 years, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan base has dashed through several distinct eras. The Classic Era let fans platform through brilliantly designed 2D stages, while the Modern Era gave us the Adventure games and Boost games, and that&#x27;s not even counting the Sonic Boom titles. Now, with the movies setting box office records and reinserting everyone&#x27;s favorite blue hedgehog back into the mainstream consciousness, a new era for Sonic the Hedgehog games could very well be upon us. With Sonic Frontiers, Sega and Sonic Team could hope to welcome fans to the Open-Zone Era of the franchise.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers&#x27; exploration-heavy gameplay. 
As seen during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears. You can obtain these gears by solving puzzles and comp…</span>

Persona 5 Royal, the 2020 upgraded version of the 2017 base game, comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 21. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are also coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, though they&#x27;ll do so later. 
Only Persona 5 Strikers, the spin-off/follow-up to Persona 5, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, a fighting-game follow-up to Persona 4, have appeared on Switch platforms. For our review of Persona 5 Royal, head here. To learn more about Persona 5 Strikers, head here.</span>

Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has pulled back the curtains on Dragon Quest Treasures, a new spin-off entry in the legendary Dragon Quest franchise that was first teased in May 2021. This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you&#x27;re exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild&#x27;s paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it&#x27;s worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level. 
Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Live A Live is just over three weeks from release, but Nintendo and Square Enix are ready to rev the hype engine. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.
The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it&#x27;s always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.
Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.</span>

                              <span>When Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle arrived on Switch in 2017, it was an unlikely success that blended the worlds of Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario franchise with Ubisoft&#x27;s zany Rabbids. The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft&#x27;s stable. Announced during Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve heard anything about that game. That changed today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which shined the spotlight on the company&#x27;s third-party partners.
Otherworldly enemies have suddenly appeared, trying to take the energy possessed by Sparks, who appear to be Rabbid versions of the Lumas from Super Mario G…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world&#x27;s final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier&#x27;s classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>When the first Mega Man Legacy Collection launched in 2015, players hoped there was more to follow. Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it&#x27;s been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I&#x27;m hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>One of the most requested titles is finally coming to Switch later this year. Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don&#x27;t know much else about what appears to be an &quot;ultimate&quot; or &quot;game of the year&quot; edition of the title, but the game&#x27;s inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition arrives on Nintendo Switch on October 6. For one Game Informer&#x27;s opinion on why you need to play Nier: Automata in some form, head here.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn&#x27;t stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn&#x27;t ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.</span>

                              <span>Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

Now there&#x27;s a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.


Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent&#x27;s deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…</span>

Okay, it is a high-spec SSD suitable for the PS5, but it&#x27;s also a really good value PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs too. Today, it&#x27;s down to $185 at Adata&#x27;s official Ebay store when you use the code FREEDOM15 - an unbelievable price for the level of performance on offer. 
That&#x27;s some $145 below MSRP and way cheaper than similarly-specced 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the Samsung 980 Pro ($260) or Crucial P5 Plus ($244).

Still, I found myself surprised when I learned that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be an early access game when it launches on September 6th.

It&#x27;s &quot;coming soon&quot; and it looks delightful in GIFs the developer has been posting on Twitter.

And that was the extent of our knowledge at the time. Well, thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct Mini, we got the briefest slice of new gameplay which expands our knowledge just a smidge further.

                              <span>I thought Sonic Frontiers was less Breath Of The Wild and more Super Mario Odyssey after I&#x27;d given it whirl in LA at Summer Geoff Fest. Despite its rough edges, Frontier&#x27;s open-ish world was a joy to blitz around as a hedgehog renowned for going particularly fast. But there was one thing I couldn&#x27;t talk about – Cyberspace stages: Bite-sized levels à la classic Sonic. And here&#x27;s why it might&#x27;ve been one of the best bits of the demo.

I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we&#x27;d like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn&#x27;t a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it&#x27;s 2005, baby, and they struggled. I&#x27;m okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn&#x27;t have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

                              <span>Also in Steam Deck news, Valve’s Lawrence Yang – a designer who worked on the on the handheld PC – has weighed in on a widely shared mod that replaces the pre-installed SSD with a larger, faster model. His advice: don’t do it.


The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

                              <span>Post-apocalyptic mod Fallout: London will arrive next year, the development team have announced with a new video released as part of the Fallout For Hope charity initiative. It’s a DLC-sized mod for Fallout 4 that’s bringing the unchanging nuclear war across the pond. Doff your bowler hat out of respect for all the nuked chippies, and watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

Lots of things with no end, basically. It&#x27;s also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon&#x27;s core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it&#x27;s fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

                              <span>After signing a deal to avoid extradition to the United States, former Megaupload executives Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk were convicted last week in the New Zealand High Court. In theory they face up to 10 years in prison so today we take a look at the specific charges and what they could mean for the two businessmen.

                              <span>During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Gamescom returns as a hybrid in-person/online event this August, and the pieces have begun falling into – and in several cases, out of – place. Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.
See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull &amp; Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.</span>

The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.</span>

Below is an obituary written by Steven L. Kent, author and gaming journalist, sent to Game Informer for use, in full: 
Bernard “Bernie” Stolar, a former top executive at Atari, Sony Computer Entertainment America, and Sega of America, passed away at the age of 75.
“Bernie was a low-key guy. He kept his ego in check,” remembers Vince Desi, founder of Running with Scissors. “I’ve known Bernie for a long time, and I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He was a gentleman in an industry where there really aren’t many.” 
Stolar’s introduction to the video game business came with the 1981 release of an arcade game called Shark Attack. Created by Pacific Novelty and manufactured by Game P…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that a Direct Mini: Partner Showcase is happening tomorrow. 
As many have predicted and expected, Nintendo is hosting a Direct tomorrow, but it&#x27;s not the typical Direct many were hoping to see happen sometime this month to coincide with the rest of the big June gaming showcases. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a Direct Mini that&#x27;s also a partner showcase. This means it will be a smaller-scale Direct (see: mini) focused on third-party titles. However, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we won&#x27;t see anything from Nintendo&#x27;s first-party studios because surprises can happen – just don&#x27;t go in expecting it. 
A new #NintendoDirectMini: Partner Showcase is on the way! Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel beginning Tuesday, June 28 at 6am PT for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party #NintendoSwitch games.

Not much else is known about the direct, and there aren&#x27;t too many rumors swirling around this partner showcase in regards to specific titles or announcements. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because we&#x27;re less than 24 hours away from this Direct Mini. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about how Shigeru Miyamoto initially cringed when he saw the art style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. 
According to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?&#x27;.&quot; Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.
“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.&#x27;” 
Miyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. 
For more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.

                              <span>An in-depth study among 50 Harvard lawyers shows that downloading and streaming pirated content is widely tolerated and even supported by some. It is certainly not seen as a form of theft by these legal experts. Based on these findings, the researchers call for a paradigm shift where entertainment providers focus more on convenience, accessibility and affordability.

                              <span>Space Bob vs. The Replicons is an ambitious 2D game about flying your spaceship onto a procedurally generated planet surface, gathering resources and tethering them to your ship, then blasting back into orbit to explore more of outerspace. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it below, but it&#x27;s not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t buy every iteration of FIFA, but I do want to give each entry a whirl to see how it has rebalanced the balls, tweaked the kicks, and polished the grass. Xbox Game Pass now helps me in my tests by, eventually, adding each iteration, and FIFA 22 is now available through the subscription service as part of June&#x27;s haul of new games.

Also added this past week: the Shadowrun Trilogy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Naraka: Bladepoint. And Far Cry 5 will arrive on July 1st.

                              <span>Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition launched this week, upping the resolution and increasing the framerate of Westwood&#x27;s ancient adventure game in ways that make it look consistently worse than the original. If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam...

Despite the gloom, overall piracy volumes are down 53% on figures reported in 2016 but FAPAV says that Italy needs to do much better.

                              <span>With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.</span>

The takedown request was sent by the ESA, which acts on behalf of Nintendo and other game companies. The problem hasn&#x27;t been sorted out completely, however, as nostalgic games can easily find alternatives, even on GitHub.

At the time the name of the &#x27;Doe&#x27; defendant was unknown. This is how a Bungie investigation followed digital breadcrumbs to track down and identify that person by name and physical address.

                              <span>The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I&#x27;m honest. Even the ones I&#x27;ve enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren&#x27;t the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it&#x27;s precisely because it&#x27;s not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It&#x27;s not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it&#x27;s all the more faithful for that.

                              <span>In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I&#x27;m willing to bet that &quot;pluviophile&quot; would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I&#x27;m doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I&#x27;ll be out frolicking in the downpour before they&#x27;ve hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can&#x27;t. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It&#x27;s time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you&#x27;ll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature&#x27;s greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s time to frolick. No umbrella required.

                              <span>A pair of new hidden object games have a pleasingly straightforward name to describe their inception: I Commissioned Some Bees. The developer paid illustrators to draw pictures with bees, and you can find the bees. It&#x27;s quite fun to find the bees. I got into hidden object games a few years back with the lovely Hidden Folks and the vast 100 Hidden X series, and today have enjoyed poring over colourful and often surreal landscapes to find our striped friends.

                              <span>We finally got our first glimpse of Starfield at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase at Summer Geoff Fest, having seen lots of clips of Todd Howard speaking words with devs who nodded across tables. I partly share the same opinion as Alice Bee, who thought the game could&#x27;ve shown us anything and they chose grey rocks again.
What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game&#x27;s reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let&#x27;s investigate.

Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell &quot;Requiem&quot;. The second is &#x27;What would it be like if you had the power of rats?&#x27;. The third is, &#x27;What if rats had any power to have?&#x27;. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called &#x27;What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn&#x27;t delayed until next year?&#x27;.

                              <span>There are two reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time once again for an episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.

Right now, you can pick up a Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle 12GB for just £330 at Scan UK, a £61 reduction over the same card at Amazon UK and some £40 cheaper than the cheapest RTX 3060 we spotted last month. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new GPU and you&#x27;ve got a 1080p monitor, this is an awesome shout.

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

Having been a fan of the Vampires and Realm Of Magic (a.k.a. wizards, basically) game packs since their respective releases, I can safely say that Werewolves has done an excellent job iterating and expanding on what worked from those previous supernatural outings.

                              <span>I was in LA for Summer Geoff Fest and I played a whole bunch of games. No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren&#x27;t too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

                              <span>Former Ubisoft developer Charles Randall has been spilling the beans about the original Assassin’s Creed on Twitter again. This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

The allegedly infringing material was taken down by Twitter but when a shadowy company tried to use the DMCA to unmask the user, Twitter mounted a legal challenge on their behalf. The court&#x27;s decision is important for both fair use and freedom of speech.

                              <span>Quentin Tarantino has asked a California court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit filed by Miramax against his &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; NFT project. The director&#x27;s legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company&#x27;s claims fall flat. The Pulp Fiction film is a derivative of the screenplay, not the other way around, they stress.

                              <span>When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that&#x27;s very boring, but it&#x27;s also positive, isn&#x27;t it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I&#x27;ll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it&#x27;s directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it&#x27;s going to be accessible if you&#x27;re new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it&#x27;s possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

                              <span>Now that all the unusually stressful benchmarking is out the way, let’s talk how mineral-grubbing “quest shooter” The Cycle: Frontier performs on PC. Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

However, the automatically applied update is primarily intended to sort out a variety of daft-sounding exploits. These range from teleporting back to your spawn point by changing loadout or class while touching the other team’s No Entry gate, to Spies disguising themselves and creating an invisible shield at their feet to block incoming fire.

The game soft-launched with a pre-season on June 8th, so its transition into the first season seems to consist largely of the launch of its Fortuna battle pass. Here’s a trailer detailing what the pass entails, below.

                              <span>The Razer Basilisk Ultimate is one of the best wireless mice on the market, offering a comfortably wide design with plenty of buttons and a fancy scroll wheel - a popular recipe that could also describe the Logitech G502. The Basilisk Ultimate normally oscillates between $140 and a sale price of $90, but today it&#x27;s gone lower - it&#x27;s $80 at Amazon.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
