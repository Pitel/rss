Keep watching the skies, as THQ Nordic has announced a launch date for its hyper-destructive sci-fi sequel Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed.

THQ Nordic lifted the lid on three editions of Destroy All Humans! 2 — Reprobed. Because why release anything if you can&#x27;t make it a little more complicated? The standard edition of the game will launch for $39.99 USD on all platforms, while a &quot;Dressed to Skill&quot; edition throws in a selection of DLC skins and challenge missions for $54.99. Finally, a physical collector&#x27;s edition will also include a selection of as-yet-unannounced gubbins, and will retail for a staggering $399. It better include a working jetpack.
Pre-orders for all editions are now live, and anybody pre-ordering any of the versions will unlock immediate access to the multiplayer standalone title, Destroy All Humans! Clone Carnage. For those of you who aren&#x27;t quite ready to commit to purchasing DAH!2: Reprobed just yet, then DAH!: Clone Carnage is also available to purchase separately, priced at $12.99.

                              <span>All four karts and Switch units safely housed in one place
Nearly two years ago when Mario Kart Live arrived, I said that what you got out of it will vary from household to household: and that rings true to this day. And it looks like Reddit user fiveonthakush got a lot out of it with this Mario Kart Live setup.
Their case is a masterpiece, in that it holds four playable karts, as well as four units of Switch hardware: which double as the controllers and screen in which to view the karts as they race around a real life &quot;track.&quot; All they&#x27;d need to do is keep the Switches charged, then carry it anywhere they want for some family fun.
The creator says the case is from mycasebuilder.com, designed with &quot;lower foam,&quot; which they cut out based on the specifications, with a &quot;routed lid&quot; to ensure that the top didn&#x27;t tightly press down on the karts and the Switch hardware. Interestingly, they &quot;swapped parts on the karts&quot; so they could tell all four apart. If you look closely, there&#x27;s a green kart with a red &quot;Mario&quot; M on it, and a red kart with a red Mario M: vice versa for two karts that feature Luigi. That way you can more easily tell who  &quot;players one through four&quot; are. They say that they hope to get even more use out of the game because of the case, which makes it easier to transport: and had fun putting the set together.
With that said, it&#x27;s sad that Velan Studios/Nintendo never released proper &quot;player three or player four&quot; karts: but for Nintendo&#x27;s experimentation, a lack of follow-through is par for the course (RIP Labo?). I know there is a community around the game, and I hope it get some sort of follow-up someday.

As both a diehard Stardew Valley and Harry Potter fan, Witchbrook has been my most anticipated game for years now. While it was officially announced back in 2020, whispers of Witchbrook have been circulating since as early as 2017, so the wait has been long for this one. Although the game isn&#x27;t even out yet, there&#x27;s a whole subreddit dedicated to tracking any and all news that updates the fans on where Witchbrook is in development, and just when it might be coming out.
It was looking pretty bleak on there for a while without any official updates from developer and publisher Chucklefish for months at a time, but after fear that the game would be silently canceled so that the studio could focus on other projects, we&#x27;ve finally received some …</span>

Last year, the people at Xbox whet the appetites of LGBTQ+ gamers and allies with their wonderfully colorful and inclusive Xbox Pride controller. I know some people consider the sheer multitude of different multicolored flags that decorate the queer community to be excessive, but nerts to them. All these flags are delightful, and when you put them all together, they can become outstanding pieces of art. Last year&#x27;s Pride controller is a work of art. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a rare piece of art as those beauties were only sent out to a few choice influencers and media members. I didn&#x27;t make the cut to get one last year (as I am not an influencer, barely a part of the media, and an all-around terrible gay man), but that won&#x27;t be a problem this year.

                              <span>The D is Shattered.
Dontnod Entertainment, the French studio behind Life is Strange, Vampyr, and Twin Mirror, is going through something of a rebranding, and will henceforth be known by its new moniker of simply &quot;Don&#x27;t Nod&quot;. The developer made the announcement in a statement to the press this week.
&quot;We are reintroducing the apostrophe and the space between the words to truly embrace the meaning of DON’T NOD. DON’T NOD is two words to represent our tendency to be non-conventional as a company and in the games that we create — as in, we DON’T NOD along to everyone else’s tune,&quot; writes the newly named company. &quot;The D [in our logo] is shattered, and the N appears within it, signifying that we are not afraid to break the mold. This new logo links our games — meaningful, powerful stories — with who we are as a company.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;F1_s94ud6Qg
In addition to the reworked name and logo, Don&#x27;t Nod also unveiled a new website sporting the fresh branding. The site has a community-focused theme, and includes a section where players and fans will be able to upload content related to Don&#x27;t Nod titles — such as artwork, short stories, and poetry, as well as testimonies and memories of their personal experiences with the company&#x27;s releases. The company also recently won plaudits for introducing &quot;work-from-home&quot; options for its workforce, a move that also opened up further opportunities for remote and satellite employees.
&quot;I am very proud of the journey that DON’T NOD has been on over the past 14 years, &quot; said Don&#x27;t Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. &quot;The company has evolved in many ways with a strong will to lead the way in creating and publishing meaningful entertainment, through original and relatable stories, which empower our talents and players to inspire change, however small. This new brand’s visual overhaul will help us convey our core identity.&quot;

                              <span>It seems to utilize enemy materials for crafting reagents
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem crafting returns, as shown in a new tweet from the game&#x27;s official Japanese Twitter account.
Enabled by party member Riku, you&#x27;ll use items gathered from enemies to create the gems, which can be equipped by characters. Increased attack and recovery power are cited as bonuses so far. For Xenoblade followers, the announcement of a gem system doesn&#x27;t really come as a shock — unless it&#x27;s a shock in the sense that you&#x27;re paralyzed by the fear of having to go through this system again.
Gems (not just in this series, but in general JRPG-dom) are polarizing, to say the least, as some involve a laborious amount of grinding, or some form of randomness. Based on what we&#x27;ve seen so far though this Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem mechanic seems a lot more straightforward. The example shown in the below tweet showcases players crafting a plus attack power gem, using six different ingredients, as well as a coin currency (that serves as an alternative method of crafting gems).
It&#x27;s unknown where coins are acquired in-game, but it could be a sidequest currency of sorts. The three classic roles (defender [blue]/attacker [red]/healer [green]) also seem present, with a fourth category (denoted by a star and an orange gem color) that is possibly a catch-all. It&#x27;s out...really soon (like a month and a few weeks!) so we&#x27;ll know soon enough.

                              <span>The Blue Blur of the Wild
Today, Sega and IGN premiered a big look at the gameplay of the next Sonic game, Sonic Frontiers. Across seven minutes it shows plenty of rolling around at the speed of sound, but also some strong influence from other open-world games.
Sonic Frontiers is set to be the next big game for Sonic, and it&#x27;s tackling the open-world genre. In today&#x27;s footage, it&#x27;s easy to see some influence from games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Alongside the literal tower that Sonic starts the clip out climbing, there are also big expanses to roam across. Plus, it seems like more than a few environmental puzzles are in store too.

At one point, Sonic runs circles around some flames to unlock a sort-of radar ping. In another, he&#x27;s walking across blocks in the correct order to light them up, without overlapping his trail. I think it&#x27;s fairly safe to say this is drawing on some modern open-world conventions.
Power up the Sonic Cycle
One thing we&#x27;ve yet to see is what&#x27;s tying all this together. Seeing Sonic run around in an open world is one thing, but I&#x27;m curious as to what the goals and structure of the game will be. Previous Sonic games usually fall into level-based formats with objectives and structure, but it seems like Sonic can just roam the open world for collectibles and puzzles in Sonic Frontiers.
This Sonic Frontiers gameplay is only a first look, though. There&#x27;s likely more info to come as IGN has Sonic Frontiers as their First feature for the month of June. Hopefully we get a little more info about what sort of enemies, characters, and goals we&#x27;re dealing with in the wide-open world of Sonic Frontiers soon.
Sonic Frontiers is aiming to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Two mods actually
A Final Fantasy X mod for Final Fantasy VII Remake? It&#x27;s a no-brainer: I&#x27;ve already downloaded it into my dreams, so I may as well make it official.
In reality, this is actually a pair of mods. One of them is a Tifa as Yuna outfit from urbandayz. Another is a Cloud as Tidus costume from Ninjagrime12. With both mods deployed, they work in concert to allow you to live out your FFX fantasy: because of course you know you want to.
A little housekeeping: so the Cloud as Tidus mod doesn&#x27;t require much legwork to get going. There&#x27;s an optional &quot;Brotherhood over the Buster Sword&quot; mod that reworks Cloud&#x27;s weapon into the FFX version from Uploaded by swifferpilled — but you don&#x27;t need it. On the Tifa side, you will need to consider that you won&#x27;t be able to see her hands properly as-is. You&#x27;ll want to apply the &quot;Tifa Invisible Weapons&quot; mod from Narknon to smooth things over.
If you want, you can use the Amano Barret design to remake the whole crew! Or bask in the glory of Final Fantasy X: a game that did get a full sequel once upon a time, but deserves to live on far beyond that scope.

                              <span>Everybody loves Lechonk
A new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet debuted this morning, showing off the new region, professors, and more. One Pokemon has made quite the impact though. The little Hog Pokemon, Lechonk, seems to have taken Pokemon Trainer hearts by storm.
One of several new Pokemon shown off in today&#x27;s trailer for Scarlet and Violet, Lechonk is a Normal Type Pokemon. It can use Aroma Veil and Gluttony, and can use its sense of smell to search out Berries.
As shown on the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet website, Lechonk is timid and fainthearted, but also strong. It will charge forward if startled, but is also largely built of muscle thanks to its constant search for Berries.
The perfect pig Pokemon

                              <span>That&#x27;s when Season 9 starts too
We finally have a date in mind for the Fallout 76 Test Your Metal update: Bethesda has confirmed a June 14 launch in a new blog post.
As a recap, Test Your Metal will task players with completing activities to earn the right to go on expeditions — which are new randomized missions that can involve the classic &quot;Pitt&quot; location from the Fallout series. Season 9 will also be arriving on the same day, and it has a name now: Heart of Steel: A Dread Island Tale. It&#x27;ll feature 100 ranks as usual, with new rewards in tow.
As far as ancillary updates and quality of life features go, you can expect Test Your Metal to have quite a few (with the granular details to come with the patch notes), but the big picture focus is on scoreboard enhancements. You can catch the deep dive into that and more in the developer video below.
The Atomic [Cash] Shop is a focus, with a developer stating: &quot;When players are spending hard-earned money buying items from the Atomic Shop, we want to make sure those items are worth the money they&#x27;re spending.&quot; It&#x27;s interesting to hear that the Atomic Shop is still such a huge focus given the messaging around its launch! Maybe the next time around, for whatever inevitable live service Fallout 76 follow-up will happen next, they can be more open about it from the get-go.

                              <span>Ever ready for the next battle
Bandai Namco&#x27;s foremost fighting title, Tekken 7, has smashed its way to an amazing nine million sales. The impressive number was revealed by Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada on Twitter this morning — the eve of the fifth anniversary of the face smasher&#x27;s home release.
Originally launching in Japanese arcades way back in 2015, it took two long years for the latest King of Iron Fist Tournament to make its way to PC and console platforms — by which point it had already seen a revamp in the form of 2016&#x27;s Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. The home port of Tekken 7 was an immediate success when it finally hit the scene on June 2, 2017, and would go on to receive a slew of new characters, stages, modes, and exciting guest stars.
Clearly, Tekken 7 is still pulling in the punters, having sold a further million copies since we last checked in on its sales figures back in November 2021. With a fresh season of fighting game tournaments on the horizon, it looks like Jin Kazama, Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and the rest of the Tekken clan are not ready to bow out just yet. And why not? After all, it&#x27;s a really rad game, and one of the premier titles in the current fighting game scene. With this milestone, the Tekken franchise has now shifted over 53 million copies since its inception, way back in 1994.
Tekken 7 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Virtua Fighter 5 fans should note that Tekken-themed costume DLC will be dropping in Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown today, June 1.

                              <span>There&#x27;s actually &quot;three unique covers&quot;
As a kid, I was drawn to the jovial cover of any given Madden game. Seeing John Madden&#x27;s friendly face was actually the reason why I picked up the series in the first place on the SNES, and he&#x27;s making a comeback for the Madden NFL 23 cover for the first time in a long time.
From 1988 until the year 2000 (when Eddie George kicked off the tradition of players on covers), John Madden himself adorned the cover of the series (from 2000-2005, Madden was present as a little sticker-like logo). After that, the &quot;Madden curse&quot; and the hype of who would be the next star athlete to appear was the next big thing, and became a given: until Madden NFL 23.
This year, EA is doing something a little differently. This morning, the publisher unveiled the cover (which is &quot;three unique covers&quot;), and it&#x27;s none other than John Madden himself. Artist Chuck Styles, who did the digital art for the Madden NFL 23 cover(s), had the following to say about Madden&#x27;s legacy: “As someone who grew up loving football, playing in the suburbs of West Philly, it’s a full circle moment to now be able to contribute to the culture of the sport by honoring an icon like John Madden, who has influenced generations of football fans through his passion for football and unmistakable energy, through my art.&quot;
EA has also dubbed June 1 &quot;Madden Day,&quot; announced remastered audio of Madden for the game, a Madden mode (with two versions of Madden coaching &quot;All Madden Athletes&quot; in the 1970s), and have dedicated the EA HQ Redwood football field as &quot;John Madden Field,&quot; with Madden family members in attendance. &quot;More ways EA is honoring John Madden will be announced in the coming weeks.&quot; It&#x27;s a &#x27;lotta Madden!

                              <span>Out on November 18, 2022
The brand new Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer is here today straight from The Pokemon Company YouTube channel, and we&#x27;re getting a bit more info on where the game stands now. Here&#x27;s a quick recap.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer 2 and info:

The trailer is three minutes long, and the intro provides a quick look at some vistas and in-game locations.
The professors seem to be a duo this time: Professor Sada and Professor Turo (which one you get will depend on the version you play).
We get a little footage of what could be the introductory Pokemon battle, featuring a character named Nemona (who serves as your companion and/or &quot;rival&quot;).

                              <span>Don&#x27;t you have PCs?
Diablo Immortal has indeed been a wild ride. Blizzard could have announced it as one of the first things at BlizzCon 2018 (instead of the closer), and tease an eventual PC port, and read the room and resisted the urge to play up the mobile-only nature of the game in a room full of PC players. Alas, new Blizzard has made quite a few mistakes (some PR-related, some on a game design level, and some on a legal scale), so it&#x27;s par for the course.
But in the end, the decidedly not mobile exclusive Diablo Immortal didn&#x27;t end up nearly as bad as some expected.

                              <span>He&#x27;s been working on the series in some capacity since Game Freak&#x27;s inception
Game Freak co-founder Junichi Masuda has been with the company since the start, but is now departing for another predominantly Pokemon-flavored role: &quot;Chief Creative Fellow&quot; at The Pokemon Company.
The news was announced today, as the industry veteran, composer, director, producer, and designer is bringing his talents to the overarching joint firm that oversees the entire Pokemon franchise. Here is Masuda&#x27;s full statement on the move, provided in both Japanese and English on The Pokemon Company&#x27;s official site:
&quot;I have served as the director of the Pokemon video game series, starting with &#x27;Pokemon Ruby Version and Pokemon Sapphire Version&#x27; up until &#x27;Pokemon X and Pokemon Y,&#x27; and was involved in the development of many video games, including Pokemon Go. I would like to express my heart-felt thanks to all Pokemon fans. Going forward, I hope to transcend the boundaries of video games by trying to offer greater surprises, fun and excitement to people all over the world, while doing my utmost to connect people, expand the circle of &#x27;play&#x27; and to help bring about a richer world for us to share. I appreciate your continued support in my new role.&quot;

Like several other big moves lately in the Japanese game industry, this wasn&#x27;t as sudden as it seems. Following Pokemon Let&#x27;s Go, Junichi Masuda decided to take a backseat from heading up core Pokemon titles in favor of passing the torch to a new generation.
As for what he&#x27;s doing next: well, the corporate speak didn&#x27;t help! &quot;Transcending the boundaries of video games&quot; sounds vaguely like a mission statement from a Metaverse-focused studio, but given how weird The Pokemon Company has gotten lately, it could be more stuff like the tooth-brushing app. He also, of course, will still be involved with the franchise directly via his new role.

                              <span>Over 30 major companies in attendance
And with the arrival of June, comes the road to E3 — or, as we call it these days, &quot;Geoff Keighley and his mates advertizin&#x27; stuff.&quot; With yet another absence form filled in by the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the spotlight falls on the Summer Game Fest, a seemingly endless showcase of publisher wares that will roll out over those hot summer nights.
Yesterday, Mr. Keighley got the hype machine in gear with a brand new post on Twitter, spotlighting 30 of the larger partner companies that will be taking part in this year&#x27;s event. The whole gang is present and accounted for, with a who&#x27;s who list that includes 2K Games, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Bloober Team, Activision Blizzard, Sega, Square Enix, Skybound, Devolver Digital, Dotemu, Epic Games, and many, many more. In fact, there are very few major publishers not featured in the splash image... save, of course, for Nintendo — notoriously standoffish when it comes to playing with others.
The core of the Summer Game Fest showcase is set to take place between June 9-12, via a selection of live streams, online presentations, social media reveals, and exceedingly long days for your friends at Destructoid and other gaming outlets. This will not suffice, however, as players can expect news, reveals, trailers, and other surprises throughout the summer months.
The action kicks off tomorrow, June 2, as Sony hosts its first State of Play stream of the new season. Be sure to tune in at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST for 30 minutes of news and headlines pertaining to all things PlayStation. Of course, over the course of this summer, we will be working tirelessly to bring you all of the pertinent details regarding all of the hottest scoops right here on Destructoid.
Who will survive and what will be left of them?

I may not buy much merch from Good Smile Company these days, but showing up to see which video game characters have been immortalized as stylish figures is a fun pastime. How will they be represented in Nendoroid form, and what are the accessories? I like to poke around. In the case of this 30th Anniversary Nendoroid Kirby, it&#x27;s all about the faces.
After three decades of powerful pink puff action, there&#x27;s this cutie (via Siliconera):
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1531474322514186240
Nendoroid Kirby: 30th Anniversary Edition comes with accessories like a bindle (the lore of the Kirby series never ceases to amaze me), a sweet potato, a heart, and a Star Rod.
You can do a face-off, too — Kirby&#x27;s starry-eyed look is a fine default, but there&#x27;s also &quot;spiral eyes,&quot; &quot;a flustered face,&quot; and my favorite, the &quot;retro face.&quot; Kirby looks so determined! Much like plump Pikachu, it&#x27;s fun to reflect on how character designs have shifted over the years. Come to think of it, Kirby&#x27;s retro face smile reminds me of a Mii.
The 30th anniversary Nendoroid Kirby costs $47.99 with an estimated ship date of February 2023, so consider this a present to your future self — how surprised will you be when you bust open the box next year? Pre-orders are open today through July 13, 2022.
Another goodie caught my eye on Good Smile&#x27;s shop page: a &quot;nap pillow&quot; plush of Waddle Dee that&#x27;s shaped like a loaf of bread. &quot;I have no mouth, and I must scream,&quot; indeed.
30 years of pleasant platforming
In August, the Kirby series will continue its celebration with an anniversary concert at Tokyo Garden Theater. It&#x27;s been a long and generally pleasant journey, hasn&#x27;t it?
1996&#x27;s mind-blowing Kirby Super Star and this year&#x27;s Kirby and the Forgotten Land are at the top of my list. (Granted, I&#x27;ve missed a lot, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine anything else resonating with me on this level; both games were a &quot;right place, right time&quot; sorta deal.)

                              <span>He&#x27;s out as of May 31
After serving Square Enix for over two decades in multiple roles, Shinji Hashimoto has left the company to retire from the industry altogether.
He announced the news directly on his Twitter account (posing with a Chocobo plush), noting that he will retire on May 31 of this year, and will continue to support the company as a fan. Directly following the tweet, Masahiro Sakurai reached out to thank him for his contributions to the field. 2021 was a prelude of sorts to this move, as he stepped down as executive director from the company to focus on other roles.
While Shinji Hashimoto isn&#x27;t as high-profile as some other members of the Square Enix collective, odds are you&#x27;ve played a game he&#x27;s worked on extensively, or read heaps of news that involved him indirectly. He was one of the first-ever people to comment on a remake of Final Fantasy VII over a decade ago, and has worked on games from Chocobo Dungeon to Kingdom Hearts III (a series that he in part is responsible for the creation of).
He was also famous for giving biting commentary when asked questions by fans and games writers alike; especially when he was quizzed about bringing back old franchises. Even if he said something people may not want to hear, he was a refreshing change of pace from the typically guarded executive part of the industry in the modern era. I hope he enjoys his retirement, and it&#x27;ll be fascinating to see where Square Enix goes next, and how they intend to fill his shoes.

The newest project to come from the experienced members of the Fallout modding community is a faithful recreation of Fallout 3&#x27;s DLC Point Lookout, now making it playable as DLC for Fallout 4. Originally released as an Xbox-exclusive adventure that was later available on all platforms, Point Lookout adds a mutant-…</span>

                              <span>Over 50,000 items already vaulted
Embracer Group, the holding company that plays host to THQ Nordic, Gearbox Entertainment, and, most recently, Eidos Montreal, has announced the formation of a new games preservation archive that hopes to curate the world&#x27;s largest collection of video games, consoles, computers, and related chicanery.
The Embracer Games Archive, which is housed in the company headquarters in Karlstad, Sweden, already boasts a collection of over 50,000 software and hardware items, from the oldest of video game releases to the most modern console platforms. A team of archivists, engineers, and researchers has been assigned to source, grow, and ensure the safekeeping of the archive&#x27;s contents.
While there are currently no plans to open the archive as a public viewing gallery, Embracer Group plans to allow access to researchers and academics as a record of the artistic, technological, and design history of our favorite pastime. In time, Embracer may make the archive available for public perusal in the form of satellite exhibitions, but for now, it appears that the team is concentrating on the sourcing and collecting of items to further expand upon its impressive catalog.
In an increasingly digital world, any form of games preservation is becoming increasingly important, and while it&#x27;s just as essential that private collectors the world over continue to gather relics from gaming&#x27;s 50-year history, Embracer Group has the finance and resources to locate, purchase, curate, and maintain the condition of an artistic and innovate history often overlooked by mainstream museums.
You can read more about the Embracer Games Archive over on its official website.

Yu Suzuki is a lauded and respected figure in the game industry, and it&#x27;s emerged that - along with his team at Ys Net - he&#x27;s returning with an arcade-style game that looks very much like a spiritual successor to Space Harrier. The downside is that it&#x27;s launching exclusively on Apple Arcade later this month, but we&#x27;ve seen a lot of games move from that platform over to Switch after a specific period; there&#x27;s definitely hope.
Called Air Twister, it looks likes a rather fun return to arcade-style gameplay in the trailer, with giant swans (or small people?) also coming into the game. The music is by Valensia, a Dutch composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist; according to this Wikipedia page they did an album called &#x27;Queen Tribute&#x27; in 2003. Listen to the music in the trailer and... yeah, you&#x27;ll get the reference.

                              <span>Thankfully you don&#x27;t have 1925 prequels to play.
Earlier this year Aksys confirmed a Western Switch release for Piofiore: Episodio 1926, a sequel to 2020&#x27;s Piofiore: Fated Memories. The former is a visual novel adventure that falls into the &#x27;Otome&#x27; category, and the next release is likely to be similar. Another notable feature of the first is how grisly and mature it is - the new title is likely to also be an 18+ experience, so be forewarned on that.
In any case, Piofiore: Episodio 1926 now has a release date - it&#x27;ll arrive on 22nd September, with physical editions and the usual eShop release. There&#x27;ll be a standard edition of course, but Aksys is also promoting a Limited Edition that can be pre-ordered on its official store. It&#x27;s also worth noting that first-run copies - both standard and limited edition - will include &quot;six full-color collectible cards featuring the main characters in the game&quot;.

The creator of Undertale and Deltarune, Toby Fox, has frequently shown off his plethora of skills during his time in the industry — from writing to game design, and even composing music! And it&#x27;s that last one that&#x27;s brought him particular attention from Game Freak and The Pokémon Company.
Toby Fox has confirmed on Twitter today that he&#x27;s responsible for some of the music that we could hear in today&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer! Namely, Toby Fox has composed the &#x27;field music&#x27; of the game, which he says Game Freak has rearranged multiple times throughout the game. Sounds like it&#x27;s one of the big leitmotifs of Scarlet and Violet, then!

Along with that, some new screenshots of the game have been showcased, displaying some truly gorgeous pixelated visuals with a world teaming with characters to meet and environments to explore.

Not too long ago, we published a list of the Best Funny Games On Switch, which showcased all the finest comedy and capers that the Nintendo Switch has to offer. But much like the iconic Greek masks of comedy and tragedy, it&#x27;s pointless to have happiness without its counterpart, sadness.
Lightness needs darkness to exist, and so too does laughter need sorrow — and, you know, sometimes it&#x27;s just really cathartic to have a nice big sob session. Whether your tears are triggered by starcrossed lovers, familial grief, or the existential pain of mortality itself, there are plenty of games in here to get you sobbing.

                              <span>Gotta go cross distance!
As part of its month-long coverage deal with IGN, Sega has finally given us a substantial look at the gameplay for Sonic Frontiers.
Clocking in at just over 7 minutes, the footage is our best look yet at the open world that players will find themselves in when the game launches later this year. We get glimpses at various methods of traversal, including grind rails, wall running, and springs that shoot Sonic up into the air. We also get a look at some of the puzzles that we&#x27;re likely to come across in the game.

If you enjoy base building and resource management, and fancy having a bit of coding and automation thrown into the mix, then there&#x27;s good news. Autonauts, from developer Denki and publisher Curve Games, is arriving on the Switch and other consoles on 16th June, so it&#x27;s just a couple of weeks away.
An award-winning title and popular on Steam since its release in 2019, it&#x27;s received plenty of praise for its style and smart utilisation of familiar ideas; check out some official details below.

Ooooh, we do love a good Pokémon rumour, especially when there&#x27;s so much evidence to go on our board of crazy theories. The latest Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet trailer just dropped, and it seems to confirm that Scarlet and Violet will somehow be tied to the past and the future, so let&#x27;s dive in to all the proof...

The metaverse is a concept that seems to be gaining ground with each passing day. With multiple companies betting big on the idea of a persistent and evolving metaverse, along with the likes of Reggie Fils-Aimé stating that the concept is something &quot;we&#x27;re all marching to&quot;, it seems almost inevitable that it will eventually become a dominant force within the gaming space before too long.
Having said that, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has expressed his scepticism on companies betting big on the &#x27;metaverse&#x27; buzzword, stating that it will end &quot;not well&quot; for many companies and that &quot;there will be failures&quot;.

After the great success of Pokémon Legends: Arceus and its experimental first steps for the Pokémon series into semi-open-world environments (discounting the limited Wild Areas from Pokémon Sword and Shield), the question of whether Pokémon Scarlet and Violet would continue this trend or return to the more discrete and linear locales of the older games has been on the minds of fans. Now that question has been answered quite plainly by The Pokémon Company following the reveal of the new trailer for the upcoming game.
In a tweet (below) from the official Pokémon news account @PokemonNewsUK, the game has been described thusly:

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are the newest Pokémon games on the block, and the first new mainline entry in the series since Pokémon Sword and Shield came out in November 2019. Scarlet and Violet will be out later this year — the 18th November, 2022, to be exact — and they&#x27;re both based around the Iberian Peninsula, so expect a lot of Spanish and Portuguese cultural references.
Here are all the new Pokémon we know about so far:

A brand new trailer for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet dropped earlier today, and we got lots of little bits of information for the upcoming 9th generation of Pokemon games, including a November release date.
However, we also got our first look at the game&#x27;s brand new legendaries who will adorn the box art and (likely) will be waiting for eager trainers towards the end of their Scarlet or Violet journey.

                              <span>And the internet seems to like them.
The new trailer for the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet has revealed not only the 18th November release date for the upcoming pair of mainline Pokémon games, but also some new characters you&#x27;ll be meeting along the way.
The trailer, which also revealed box art and Koraidon and Miraidon, the headlining Legendary Pokémon for the game, highlighted several new Pokémon and also two professors, Sada and Turo, as well as Nemona, a powerful Pokémon trainer and — presumably — your new rival.

It&#x27;s pretty well known at this point that during the &#x27;Cool, Cool Mountains&#x27; stage in Super Mario 64, you can chuck the poor baby penguins off the edge of the cliff to their doom. But did you know you can also cause the adult penguins to plummet to their deaths too, thus extinguishing the entire family from existence? Nope, we didn&#x27;t either until today!
In a post on Twitter, user &#x27;Supper Mario Broth&#x27; shared an explanation as to how this can be accomplished, utilising exploits discovered by multiple experts.

Retro-Bit, the retro gaming stockist and publisher, has revealed its very first Game Boy release for arcade-come-Game Boy classic Avenging Spirit.
Not many people may have heard of this forgotten classic, but it&#x27;s absolutely one worth digging up. Released on the game Boy in 1992, and later brought to the 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console, despite the adorable-looking ghost on the cover, you actually can&#x27;t stay as a ghost for too long, and must possess various people in order to survive — all to find your girlfriend!

When the Nintendo DSi launched it helped to shake up Nintendo&#x27;s approach to selling games on its portable hardware, following the lead set by Wii and introduction a download store. A hugely popular arrival was Flipnote Studio, a free download that allowed talented users to create basic but entertaining animations and drawings.
Users were then able to share creations online through Flipnote Hatena, a website that passed one million users. This app and the online service only lasted 4 years, however, due to the arrival of 3DS and a successor - Flipnote Studio 3D. The original Flipnote Hatena service was taken down.

                              <span>Měsíc utekl lusknutím prstu a krom konference InstallFest se nám přiblížila i další Virtuální Bastlírna. Chcete vědět, co za zajímavé novinky a zvláštní témata jsme pro Vás našli tentokrát?

I když se to nezdá jako reálná možnost, ukážeme Vám, jak použít globální síť FindMyIphone gigantu Apple pro monitoring stavu Vaší poštovní schránky. Podíváme se také na hrozivou elektroinstalaci z facebookových videí a pro milovníky vintage audiotechniky ukážeme krásnou studii NASA zabývající se důvody selhání starých tranzistorů. A samozřejmě mnoho dalšího...

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 2. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00. Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo si chcete jenom popovídat, dorazte, jste srdečně vítáni! Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>While Ubuntu 22.04 LTS was just released over one month ago, it is shipping on the Linux 5.15 kernel that was already two stable series behind at release time but chosen as the default due to its long-term support status. Ubuntu 22.04 also shipped with Mesa 22.0 as the latest stable version albeit the open-source OpenGL/Vulkan graphics drivers are quick to advance. So if you&#x27;ve been thinking about upgrading Mesa or the Linux kernel on your Ubuntu 22.04 system for better Linux gaming performance, here are some benchmarks looking at such performance impact for AMD RDNA2 / Radeon RX 6000 series graphics.</span>

                              <span>Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. 
Anthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. 
This news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”
“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.
The publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series.

                              <span>Yesterday, Sega debuted roughly 30 seconds of Sonic Frontiers open-world gameplay and today, you can now watch more than seven minutes of gameplay, courtesy of IGN. It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. 
Right off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:


As you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. 
Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday.

                              <span>Knockout City developer Velan Studios announced back in February that its dodgeball multiplayer game would be going free-to-play. Today, that free-to-play version of Knockout City has launched. Plus, Season 6 is now live too. 
The new season is called City of Tomorrow, and in it, the Super-Science Symposium is back in town, and scientists from all over the world are duking it out in dodgeball to show off their wildest inventions as a result. With these scientists’ new tech comes plenty of new toys for dodgeballers to play with, which means players have a lot of new things to try out like a new Special Ball, updates to hideouts, new crew vehicles, and a new Brawl Pass that features an Among us crossover.

                              <span>Diablo Immortal is finally out on mobile devices, a full day earlier than expected for some regions. 
The entire Diablo Immortal launch, which will see the game hit iOS and Android devices everywhere and PC, is still slated for tomorrow, June 2, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. If you plan on playing the first-ever, built-from-the-ground-up-for-mobile Diablo game on a phone, then head to your app store to see if it’s available.
While waiting for it to download, check out our latest gameplay from it below:


“As we prepare to launch Diablo Immortal on June 2 at 10 a.m. PDT for iOS, Android, and PC in Open Beta, some players will see Immortal propagate on the Apple App Store and Google Play beginning the morning of June 1 PDT,” a blog post reads. “This is in part due to the nature of how mobile games rollout to ensure a smooth full launch for the mobile version of Immortal. To confirm when Immortal will be fully launched for your region on all platforms, please reference the below time map.” 
The blog post mentions that the game won’t launch in some Asia Pacific regions, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, until June 22. It will launch that same day in Vietnam but only on PC in Open Beta. According to Blizzard, these regions will receive dedicated game servers to bring players better connectivity and ping. 
For more information about this rollout, including a look at Blizzard’s current roadmap for Diablo Immortal, head to this “Roadmap To Hell.” After that, read Game Informer’s review in progress of Diablo Immortal, and then check out this Diablo Immortal segment of New Gameplay Today to look at how it runs on both mobile devices and PC.

                              <span>John Madden has lent his name to the longest-running NFL franchise in the video game industry for nearly three and a half decades and EA Sports is honoring the memory of the late coach and broadcaster with three separate covers for Madden NFL 23. Following John Madden&#x27;s passing in December 2021, EA Sports made the call to dedicate this year&#x27;s game to the man who made the franchise possible in the first place. To do so, rather than featuring an athlete on the cover of Madden NFL 23, EA Sports created three distinct covers to celebrate the three major areas of John Madden&#x27;s contributions to the game of football.
The first cover honors John Madden&#x27;s contributions to the NFL as a coach, featuring him being carried off the field on the shoulders of his players following his head coaching victor…</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer for Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet and it reveals the new professors, four-player co-op capabilities, the new legendaries, the box art for the two games, and more. 
It also reveals that Pokémon Violet and Scarlet will hit Switch on Nov. 18. On that day, you&#x27;ll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you&#x27;re playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you&#x27;re playing Violet (right).
You can check them out in action in the trailer below:


Shortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won&#x27;t be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we&#x27;ll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.
Plus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. 
The trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation&#x27;s two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. 

For more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen&#x27;s starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far. After that, read up on all the version differences and exclusives in Pokémon Violet and Scarlet revealed thus far.

                              <span>You just heard the collective sigh of relief from achievement hunters all over the world because their hobby just got a lot more convenient. 
That’s because after a new Xbox update, you&#x27;ll be able to view secret achievements from wherever you’re playing an Xbox game. Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. 
“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity &gt; Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. 
“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” 
Here’s a look at how it works: 
While waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that.

                              <span>Blizzard is launching its first big Diablo mobile game this week, and I&#x27;ve had it on my phone for the last handful of days, putting it through hell for review. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t able to see everything that Diablo Immortal has to offer after spending over 15 hours with the free-to-play handheld action RPG, but in lieu of a full review, I&#x27;d like to share some thoughts on my time with Immortal as the game is soon to be available for everyone to play on mobile devices and PC.
Much of Diablo Immortal is designed to look, sound, and feel like Diablo 3, and in my time leveling a Crusader, it nails those lofty expectations effortlessly. Never once during my time slaying the minions of evil have I felt like this was a reskin of another mobile game, imposter using the Diablo name, or that it f…</span>

The impeccable graphics and thought-provoking narrative shine so brightly in this puzzle/adventure title that the game’s defects, like the frustrating lack of direction, stand out in grimy, stark contrast. The moment I began playing, I was under the aquatic world’s monochromatic and disquieting spell. However, the magic was continuously dispelled as I increasingly encountered imbalanced challenges and tedious objectives.
Silt is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful games I’ve played this year. Its unde…</span>

In the tweet posted above, Keighley states that SGF will feature events and updates from over 30 partners, with more to be announced. For now, the line-up includes: 
2K
Activision
Atlus
Bandai Namco
Bloober Team
Capcom
Coffee Stain
Deep Silver
Devolver Digital
Digital Extremes
Dotemu
EA
Epic Games
Focus Entertainment
Frost Giant Studios
Humble Games
Level Infinite
Mediatonic
miHoYo
Netflix
PlayStation
Raw Fury
Samsung Gaming Hub
Sega
Square Enix
Skybound Games
Steam

Now that we have a clearer idea of which companies have something to show, the speculation can begin. Will Bloober Team reveal its long-rumored Silent Hill project or its already announced Layers of Fear sequel? Will Dotemu finally spill the beans on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge release date? Square Enix has already teased something Final Fantasy VII-related for the event; could it be a Remake 2 reveal? We&#x27;ll get all those answers and more next week.

                              <span>Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That&#x27;s how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring&#x27;s major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That&#x27;s not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you&#x27;ll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring&#x27;s major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software&#x27;s magnificent fantasy realm.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of my favourite SSDs, as you might know from me writing about it last week. . Then, I was happy to announce that this rapid 1TB PCIe 4.0 drive had made it to £100 - a price it&#x27;s gotten near a few times before but not stayed at with any regularity. You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I discovered that Crucial are now selling the same drive at their site for £80.69 - a genuine bargain and the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen by some margin.

                              <span>It’s officially summer, although you wouldn’t think it based on the amount of rain we’ve had up here in Newcastle this week. Still, that vague hint of warmth that lingers between the raindrops has got me dreaming of all those lovely things that make summer so appealing. Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.


OK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Why do we even bother leaving the house, when we can stay indoors and play video games on PC instead? June is a little sparse when it comes to new releases (as is so often the case during these warmer seasons) but there’s still plenty on the horizon to keep you occupied.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s 12th-gen motherboards are getting cheaper, which is handy if you&#x27;re planning a new build around one of Intel&#x27;s excellent 12100, 12400F or 12600F CPUs for gaming. One of the best deals we&#x27;ve spotted is for the Asus Prime B660M-A WiFi D4, which launched at £197 and is now down to £86 at CCL in the UK.
This motherboard uses better value DDR4 memory, two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots and WiFi 6 on board, so it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the essentials. You&#x27;re missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now.

                              <span>I used to draw Abe’s Oddysee levels. Then Abe’s Exoddus, when that came out. Also, before them, every other platform game I ever got my hands on. Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.


Enter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”

                              <span>A surprise God of War PC update has made it one of just three games to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. This significantly improved upscaling option, introduced a few weeks back in Deathloop (and more recently making it to Farming Simulator 22), completely replaces God of War’s FSR 1.0 setting, giving Radeon GPU owners a performance booster that comes much closer to Nvidia DLSS on quality.

                              <span>Has anyone coined the term Limbolike yet? 2D side-scrolling platformers that are a bit Tim Burton-y, and possibly in monochrome. Y&#x27;know the ones? Silt is a Limbolike, only it&#x27;s Limbo under the sea. Other free-wheeling associations I have made include Minute Of Islands and, most weirdly, Gormenghast. But having mentioned the later, and because people who like Gormenghast really bloody like Gormenghast (a reasonable position), and respond to its evocation like Chekhov&#x27;s dogs let loose at the eleventh annual Ringing World National Youth Championship competition, I&#x27;m now going to have to temper expectations back down.

                              <span>Super Meat Boy hurts so good
A busy new month of gaming awaits us, so before we all forget, let&#x27;s quickly look over the Xbox Games with Gold lineup for June. Soon enough, subscribers will be able to nab the original version of Super Meat Boy, as well as another gem from the Xbox Live Arcade era, Raskulls, and two city-builders: Aven Colony (from 2017) and Project Highrise (from 2018).
For June 2022, Xbox Games with Gold is giving out four free games:
Aven Colony (June 1–30)
Project Highrise: Architect’s Edition (June 16–July 15)
Super Meat Boy (June 1–15)
Raskulls (June 16–30)
With an active Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you can redeem these games during those listed time frames, then keep &#x27;em for good.
Many of us have been there and back again with Super Meat Boy — a true test of determination just as much as platforming reflexes. It&#x27;s one of those greats in its genre, and this is the original Xbox Live Arcade edition, so grab your headphones and crank it up.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_324647&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot;] Aven Colony.[/caption]
The other throwback for June is Raskulls, a frantic action-platformer that&#x27;s notable around here for its sharp-dressed Mr. Destrctoid cameo, while Aven Colony and Project Highrise are a bit newer (but not exactly &quot;fresh&quot;). The former is a city-builder with drones and aliens, while the latter is going for a more squished SimTower vibe. Not a bad spread!
More games to check out sooner than later
Some of the May selections, including Viva Piñata Party Animals, are still claimable.
While we&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s coming and going, there&#x27;s also an update on Xbox Game Pass, with highlights like Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection on June 2, and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, Chorus, and Disc Room on June 7. Eric has the latest Game Pass recap for June.

Nexon&#x27;s decision to drop a brand new trailer for each and every feature in its incoming fighter DNF Duel is certainly... a choice, but I suppose it helps to communicate to the fighting game community that the plucky underdog title will be stepping into the ring loaded for bear when it arrives in June.
This latest lightning-fast video focuses specifically on DNF Duel&#x27;s online options, which include Ranked Vs battles, a full online ranking system, player profile cards, and a replay library — an invaluable tool when it comes to rewatching and reassessing everything that you and your chosen fighter might have gotten right, or so very wrong. In all, the online options for DNF Duel look pretty standard, though it should be recalled that the Arc System Works-developed…</span>

                              <span>These geese are going maverick
Yu Suzuki and his studio YS Net are working on a game for Apple Arcade. The crew revealed it as Air Twister today, and its trailer is a pretty fun way to kick off the summer of video game news.
The trailer kicks off with death and destruction, as infantry riding giant birds fight in battle against robots. The protagonist, Princess Arch, mourns a swan before taking off and leaping the trailer into a vastly different tone.
Suddenly it&#x27;s showing gameplay, with a Killer Queen-sound-alike blasting in the background. It is truly incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;R1A5WJ2YFVc
According to the App Store page, Air Twister is an endless shooter. Players move around the screen using swipe movements and blast enemies out of the sky. There are 12 stages, over 20 different enemies and 10 unique bosses, Stars to collect and global rankings to chase.
Suzuki is apparently hesitant to call this a Space Harrier successor though. In a briefing (via GameSpot) Suzuki said he&#x27;s always had this idea for a fantasy shooting game, but the limited available tech ended up leading to Space Harrier. With 2022&#x27;s tech, he&#x27;s made Air Twister, which he calls his &quot;ideal fantasy shooting game.&quot;

The golden goose
The last game we saw from Suzuki and YS Net was Shenmue III, the latest entry in the Shenmue series that felt like a time capsule. Seeing the team turn its efforts towards mobile is an interesting move. But one that clearly makes an impression. Yes, I&#x27;m surprised by the fantasy shooter with geese, spacesuits, lasers, and robots. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m not intrigued to see what it becomes, though.
Those interested won&#x27;t need to wait long, either. Air Twister hits Apple Arcade on June 24. Alongside it are a few other releases for the mobile gaming platform. Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins sets off on June 3, and Cooking Mama: Cuisine! lands on June 17.

                              <span>SD-BD to feature all 35 episodes
Double headlines for Virtua Fighter fans today. Following on from the news that Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown will be receiving its Tekken crossover DLC tomorrow, separate news sees publisher Discotek Media announce plans to release the long-forgotten &#x27;90s anime adaptation of Sega&#x27;s fighting franchise.
Speaking on Twitter, Discotek Media revealed that all 35 episodes of the Virtua Fighter anime, which first premiered way back in 1996, will be released on Blu-ray at an undisclosed point in 2022. It should be noted, immediately, that the release is SD-BD, and thus the anime will, sadly, not be remastered in high definition. While no reason is offered for this, it is often a common practice when the source material is simply not of a decent enough quality to offer remaster potential.
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1530550433432760320?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;igw5Phe3QuuBQDAyUaK3mg
On a more positive note, the new release will feature all 35 episodes of the anime, meaning fans who are still waiting on an official edition of the final 11 episodes, previously unreleased by Anime Works, will finally be able to add them to your collection. All 35 episodes will feature English subtitles, and the original English dub for the first 24 episodes is also in the mix. More extras are to be revealed in the future.
While I won&#x27;t deny the lack of an HD remaster or a full, fresh series dub for the entire series is disappointing, it&#x27;s nice to see the forgotten anime finally make a home video comeback in its entirety. The Virtua Fighter Blu-ray will no doubt find a pride of place alongside Discotek&#x27;s other video game anime rerelease, which include SNK&#x27;s Fatal Fury and Capcom&#x27;s Darkstalkers.

                              <span>Still due on June 23, 2022
The Sonic Origins file size has been revealed, at least on Switch, and the base edition clocks in at 3.6GB, quite a bit larger than Sonic Mania.
For reference, Sonic Mania sits comfortably at 390MB, which is great news for folks who don&#x27;t have a ton of space on their Switch. Sonic Origins, again, is nearly 10 times that amount, and the Digital Deluxe Edition adds a little heft, coming in at 3.8GB (the Nintendo store size is erroneous, and the actual eShop listing shows the correct size).
As a reminder, that Sonic Origins file size includes the following games (plus extras):
Sonic 1
Sonic 2
Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles
Sonic CD
The Digital Deluxe Edition includes &quot;bonus hard missions, additional music tracks, backgrounds, character animations, and an island camera,&quot; which accounts for that extra space.
I hope after all this, and all of the confusing pre-order layers, that this ends up paying off. Sonic could always use a win, and coming off of the successful film would be great timing. Plus, with a quality product, the company can set up Sonic Frontiers for success if it continues to ride that wave. As usual though it is Sonic: so anything is possible.

                              <span>Take it to the Chorus
The Xbox Game Pass lineup for the start of June is out, and it&#x27;s got some familiar faces. Ubisoft games, indies, and spaceships make up the first few June Xbox Game Pass entrants, though it sounds like more are in store.
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins is one of the headliners, bringing the massive journey through ancient Egypt onto cloud, console, and PC. As the first of Ubisoft&#x27;s major overhaul of the series, it&#x27;s historically relevant. And also, I&#x27;d argue, pretty alright. It&#x27;s also getting 60 FPS support on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on June 2, so good timing.
Another entry takes a different trip down memory lane. The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection gathers up three games from the Ninja Gaiden series, plus all modes and DLC, into one set. If you&#x27;ve never seen Ryu Hayabusa in action outside the Dead or Alive fighting games, this seems like a good way to handle that.

Spacelines from the Far Out is the available day-one launch in June&#x27;s early Game Pass lineup. It&#x27;s a rogue-like co-op management game, and seems to mix some throwback aesthetics with space travel. It&#x27;s got some Jetsons vibes, which seems pretty neat.
Xbox teases that it isn&#x27;t done for the month, either. More games, release dates, and &quot;possibly a few surprises&quot; are in store. Maybe we&#x27;ll get some news on more Game Pass updates at that upcoming Xbox and Bethesda showcase?

An Acquire (the Akiba&#x27;s Trip studio) showcase is coming, helping to kick off &quot;E3&quot; a bit earlier this year, on June 5 at 7AM ET.
The news was announced via their Twitter account, and they&#x27;re taking questions, provided that you use the hashtag &quot;#アクワイアへの質問.&quot; As a reminder, we have a full list of all of the &quot;E3&quot; streams for June 2022 here, and Acquire is actually one of the first, which will help kick things off. Before them, Sony is doing their thing with a State of Play on June 2, followed by a June 9 Summer Game Fest kickoff.
Acquire is one of those Japanese companies that&#x27;s been around forever, quietly making games. It blew up immediately after the release of Tenchu 1 and 2, before the series was taken away from them shortly after (oh what could have been). From there they continued down a similar path with Way of the Samurai and Shinobido, before hitting it big in 2011 with Akiba&#x27;s Trip.
Since then they&#x27;ve been collaborating with various studios (including doing some co-development work on Octopath Traveler), and supplementing their income with multiple Akiba&#x27;s Trip titles. As Gematsu points out, we can expect at least one new reveal following a leak: Class of Heroes Quest.

                              <span>[Extremely Shania Twain voice]: Let&#x27;s go girls.
Sega is betting big on Sonic Frontiers this year, and just ahead of a June blowout, the company shared a &quot;small preview&quot; of the game&#x27;s open-world action and exploration gameplay. Sega says to expect more info &quot;all June long,&quot; but for now, here&#x27;s roughly 20 seconds of honest-to-goodness (albeit chopped up and teaser-ified) gameplay footage.
Is this what you were expecting from Sonic Frontiers?
https://youtu.be/BS9YAiD9EP8
As someone who really only properly gets into Sonic&#x27;s side-scrolling adventures, the idea of a 3D Sonic game that takes cues from Breath of the Wild has been intriguing, admittedly — enough for me to pay attention to the news and teaser videos like this one.
That said, talk about an incredibly tall order for Sonic Team. Many of us know to go in with modest expectations, and I&#x27;m sticking to that strategy until proven otherwise.
Try as we might, there&#x27;s only so much to glean from this out-of-context Sonic Frontiers gameplay clip. A realistic-ish green landscape with floating rails dotting the horizon? Not exactly the strongest first impression. In the new footage, Sonic runs on a wheel to power up a radar (?), zips around robots in a combat encounter, and ultimately scales a big boy.
The promise of &quot;open-zone freedom&quot;
For me, whether this game succeeds or not will boil down to two general questions: is it inherently fun to traverse this world, and do I feel rewarded for exploring beyond the quickest path forward? If Sonic Frontiers can clear those bars, that&#x27;ll be a good starting point for keeping my interest in the run-up to reviews and the game&#x27;s launch this year.
Sega will be back with more Sonic Frontiers reveals starting tomorrow, June 1, on IGN.
Today&#x27;s teaser didn&#x27;t divulge any new release timing info, but Sonic Frontiers is confirmed for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>She has a few comprehensive videos at this point
Yelan is the big star of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 2.7 update, and following a story reveal, we now have a ton of info on her gameplay nuances.
As a hydro bow user, Yelan hails from Liyue, and represents the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Her gimmick involves charging aimed shots out of combat, as well as firing off an ability that scales based on her HP (making her easy to build for), and she&#x27;s armed with one of the coolest looking elemental bursts in the game (that deals area-of-effect hydro damage). Thematically, her passive grants her 25% extra rewards if you put her in a 20-hour Liyue expedition.
Once again, miHoYo has done a fantastic job of selling me on a character. On paper I didn&#x27;t really have much interest in picking up Yelan, but her &quot;Shadow in the Rain&quot; clip has so much style to it, and I&#x27;m getting Fujiko Mine vibes from her personality (the music contributes to it). You can watch nearly 10 minutes of footage below and make the decision on your own!
She headlines the 2.7 update, which is out now (it released late last night in the US). We&#x27;re getting closer and closer to the big 3.0 expansion.
Here&#x27;s the big six-minute rundown of Yelan:

                              <span>The day the music died
The Pokemon Diamond and Pearl sound library is only a few months old, but it&#x27;s already shutting its doors. Nintendo and The Pokemon Company confirmed its closure today, May 31.
Over on the sound library site, a message states that the service was terminated as of 9 a.m. UTC this morning. It also thanks those who supported the service since launch.
Anyone who downloaded sound data from the site is still allowed to use it, as long as it&#x27;s within the Terms of Use and Guidelines previously set out. The site will stay up to keep hosting those Guidelines, just not the music itself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;TUOlZBxdrTA
Diamonds aren&#x27;t forever
It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer, considering the sound library for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl only launched in February of this year. The website featured music from both of the Sinnoh region games, at a time when Sinnoh sentiment was high
The sound library contained plenty of neat possibilities. It was completely functional as a basic radio, for those who just wanted to enjoy the sounds of Sinnoh at home.
Or, for musicians and others, it was a repository of samples. The sound library for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl being available for non-commercial use was good for fans. Pokemon fans might have been able to use those noises for anything, from wrestling entrances to wedding processions.
Nintendo has historically cracked down when it comes to copyright issues. Usually, that means making it difficult for fans to listen to music somewhere online, or find usable tools for content creation. Square Enix recently tackled this issue, opening its own YouTube channel filled with Final Fantasy and other RPG series music.
For Diamond and Pearl fans, it looks like the sound repository is shut down for the time being. Hopefully all the Pokemon rap creators already got their samples.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is the next attempt to make Sonic work in a 3D world, with Sega referring to it as the blue hedgehog&#x27;s &quot;first ever open zone&quot; game. Now there&#x27;s a first teaser trailer of it in action, showing Sonic zipping around a seemingly vast world and bashing giant robots to bits.

                              <span>Here we have another AOC gaming monitor, except it’s not just by AOC, but by posh car makers Porsche? It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.


It’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020&#x27;s AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?

It&#x27;s a bold play releasing a Soulslike in any year, let alone the year of Elden Ring. You could snap open any twelve month span like a bulrush and watch many thousands of little Soulslikes disperse into the atmosphere, with only a select few really making an impact.
Steelrising is one of these Soulslike seeds hoping to sink into our screens, sprout, and take root not only in the innards of our Panasonics, but our minds too. From what I&#x27;ve seen, it stands a chance of survival in a saturated land.

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers was teased way back in 2019 before it was teased once again in 2021. It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. 
This new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: 


As you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon.

                              <span>Update, 6/1/022
After a leak yesterday, Sony has confirmed that the June 2022 PlayStation Plus games are God of War (2018), Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker. This news accompanies word that they won&#x27;t be available to you as a PlayStation Plus member until the new and revamped service goes live, which is set for June 13 in the U.S. 
&quot;When the all-new PlayStation Plus launches into your region, these titles will be available as monthly games to all PlayStation Plus members including those on the PlayStation Plus Essential Plan (which includes the same benefits PlayStation Plus members get today),&quot; the PlayStation Blog post reads. 
You have until June 6 to download last month&#x27;s free games, which were FIFA 22, Tribes of Midgard, and Curse of the Dead Gods.

On June 2, Bayak’s revenge quest across Ptolemy-era Egypt will run even better thanks to the addition of 60 FPS gameplay. The update will be available for those who play the game on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Origins’ successor, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, received the same current-gen FPS boost last August.

                              <span>Xbox has begun to announce its upcoming slate of Game Pass titles for next month, with six games joining the service in the opening days of June. Sharpen your blades and get ready for plenty of action with the three big games coming to the subscription service over the next week. Ubisoft is providing two games with For Honor: Marching Fire Edition hitting tomorrow and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins arriving on June 7, just in time for Series X owners to enjoy the new 60FPS update. Koei Tecmo is also bringing Ryu Hyabusa&#x27;s remastered trilogy of 3D adventures to Game Pass with the June 2 addition of Ninja Gaiden Master Collection. 
Here&#x27;s the full list of Game Pass additions coming in the first part of June:
For Honor: Marching Fire Edition – June 1 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Ninja Gaiden Master Collection – June 2 (Console and PC)
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Chorus – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Disc Room – June 7 (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Spacelines from the Far Out – June 7 (Console and PC)
With new games joining the service, others are often leaving as well. Get your game time in with the following titles that will be gone from Game Pass on June 15:
Darkest Dungeon (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Greedfall (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Limbo (Console, PC, and Cloud)
Worms Rumble (Console, PC, and Cloud)
This newest Game Pass update only stretches into the first week of June, but keep in mind that Xbox and Bethesda are holding their joint showcase of upcoming games on June 12. Keep your eyes peeled on that presentation and Game Informer for more updates on what&#x27;s coming to Game Pass in the future.</span>

                              <span>V Rising launched in Steam Early Access on May 17, and the vampire action survival game has quickly taken the world by storm. Developer Stunlock Studios revealed that the game has pushed past 1.5 million copies sold in only two weeks.
Stunlock doesn’t provide an exact sales number, but 1.5 million+ is a remarkable feat for a game technically in its infancy. V Rising has been popular on Twitch and has garnered strong reviews thus far. The game puts you in the undead boots of a newly awakened vampire who must build their empire. Similar to games like Valheim, players explore an open world in search of resources (either from nature itself or by pillaging villages) to construct a castle and become the second coming of Dracula. Combat pushes you to use your supernatural abilities to take down a host of otherworldly creatures, and you can tackle the game alongside friends in co-op. You can also attack other players’ castles in PvP. 


As an Early Access title, V Rising will continue to receive updates and improvements over the next several months. The game’s Steam page states that Stunlock hopes to launch the game in 1.0 within the next 12 months, barring any changes.</span>

                              <span>Ustwo’s Monument Valley and its sequel are coming to PC this summer. 
More specifically, Monument Valley: Panoramic Edition and Monument Valley II: Panoramic Edition will hit PC on July 12. Both of these illusion-based geometric puzzle games were released on iOS and Android devices in 2014 and 2017 respectively, and now, for the first time ever, they’ll be playable on non-mobile devices. As the name implies, the view of the game, which is longer than it is horizontal as a result of being mobile games, will be shifted to account for PC monitors. Instead, both Monument Valley games will be presented in a wide view and you can see what that looks like below thanks to the series’ art director:

Both games can be added to Steam wishlists right now and unsurprisingly, in order to run these games on your PC, you’re not going to need much horsepower at all. As for price, each will be available for $7.99 and both games will come with their previously released DLC, which incudes Ida’s Dream and Forgotten Shores for Monument Valley and The Lost Forest for Monument Valley II. 
While waiting for July 12, read Game Informer’s Monument Valley review and then read Game Informer’s Monument Valley II review.

                              <span>Square Enix is synonymous with widely known JRPG franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Kingdom Hearts, and Nier. However, a lesser-known series that&#x27;s produced some under-the-radar experiences is returning. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is launching on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and iOS and Android devices this winter. 
The instruments change, but 30 years later the melody remains the same.

Minstrel Song dropped exclusively on PlayStation 2 in 2005. The updated visuals (changed from bit art to 3D) don&#x27;t do much to improve the very bizarre character designs, but fans of the series that never got to play it more than a decade ago will finally get to test their skills with the game&#x27;s combat and class systems. 
Minstrel Song itself is a remake of the original Romancing SaGa game released on the Super Famicom in 1992. The narrative follows eight adventurers as they try to stop the resurgence of an ancient deity of darkness. 
The Game Informer archives reveal that Joe Juba gave Romancing SaGa a 5 out of 10 and said that the game vied for the worst RPG of the year. Hopefully, the remaster gives it a second lease on life. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered drops on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and mobile devices later this year.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that a brand new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet is dropping tomorrow. 
The trailer will go live at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET tomorrow, June 1, on the official Pokémon YouTube trailer. As for what to expect, that remains unknown as the tweet announcing this news says to tune in to the channel &quot;for the latest on Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.&quot; If it&#x27;s like trailers in years past, we&#x27;ll likely learn more about the world of Gen 9, including some new looks at Pokémon, locales we&#x27;ll be visiting, and, if we&#x27;re lucky, a look at the two main legendaries that will appear on the boxes of these two Switch games.

I&#x27;m hoping to see the legendaries we&#x27;ll be encountering and a release date. We only know the games are releasing in &quot;Late 2022.&quot; That likely means somewhere in the October through November timeframe if this gen follows previous generations&#x27; steps. Still, I&#x27;d love to get official confirmation of when I&#x27;ll be playing this game and picking Quaxly, the best starter, to join me on my adventure. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about the original Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet announcement, which included our first looks at the three starters this time around. Then, check out all of the Pokémon confirmed for these games thus far. Check out this breakdown of all the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet version differences and exclusives revealed after that.

                              <span>Tunic started with a difficult choice for lead developer Andrew Shouldice: stay at his stable job or take the plunge and quit to work full-time on his budding game idea. In 2015, Shouldice closed his eyes and jumped. However, when asked why he made that decision, he initially hesitates. 
“Why indeed?” Shouldice answers after a beat with a chuckle and a dramatic tone that suggests Tunic’s development cycle was a long one. There is no single incident he can point to that spurred him into making his choice. Instead, several factors, including how much he enjoyed making past one-off projects and his dwindling excitement for his job, influenced his decision to strike out on his own. His departure wasn’t without uncertainty.
“I remember thinking to myself; this might be a bad decision,” Shouldic…</span>

                              <span>During the recent closed alpha test, we sat down to talk about all things MultiVersus with the game&#x27;s director, Tony Huynh, from Player First Games. In this interview, we talk with Tony about what MultiVerus is, how it is to work with Warner Bros on the project, philosophies on its core combat designs and business models, and much more. 
Game Informer: Can you tell us about MultiVersus? What’s the quick pitch of it?
Tony Huynh: MultiVersus is a cooperative platform fighter. It&#x27;s free to play. And it&#x27;s a game that has a lot of the barriers removed, that&#x27;s really easy to pick up, but also a really smooth, gradual mastery curve into the game. Its focus is on cooperative team-based gameplay. So from the ground up, everything about it is team-based, working with your ally, all the abilities and…</span>

We recently discussed the best Kingdom Hearts characters, and, surprisingly, several of us excluded Sora from the cream of the crop. However, a defender propped up Sora’s one defining good trait: his overwhelming positivity. In response, I jokingly said if optimism is all Sora offers, he should be replaced by a superior beacon of positivity: Ichiban Kasuga, star of Yakuza: Like a Dragon. We had a good laugh and moved on, but the idea lingered in my brain. I need this to happen. 
I’ll preface my next statement with this disclosure: I like Kingdom Hearts. Now that blowback immunity is activated, I think Sora is lame. He’s a good kid with a great heart, and he’s fun to …</span>

                              <span>If you’ve ever wondered if people in the world of Star Wars play sports that don&#x27;t involve racing repulsorcrafts, we now know that they play at least one: Blitzball. 
No, you didn’t misread that – it says Blitzball, you know, the underwater hockey-like sport played by Tidus, Wakka, and others in Final Fantasy X. That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. 
#6: There&#x27;s a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA

As you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? 
If you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter.

                              <span>Back in March, I began playing Grand Theft Auto V for the first time ever. I somehow missed it in 2013, and as the years went by, I realized maybe I just wasn’t that interested in it. However, I couldn’t shake the idea that I had a GTA-sized gap in my gaming knowledge, especially as I write news stories seemingly every month about its massive sales numbers, which somehow keep increasing, the continuous flow of GTAV Online content, and more. 
GTA V is as prevalent today as it was in 2013, so when the new-gen editions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were released in March, I decided to finally give it a go. And, unsurprisingly to most reading this probably, it lived up to the hype. So much so that I’m still playing it today, more than two months later. I love playing through the game’s …</span>

                              <span>It’s Memorial Day, and to celebrate the long weekend, we’re shining the spotlight on the asymmetrical multiplayer genre. This category features games where two groups face each other, but each side has unique, sometimes wildly disproportionate, skills and goals. As evidenced by many of the year’s recently released and upcoming titles, like Evil Dead: The Game, IllFonic’s Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleased, and Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the genre is seeing a resurgence. There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.

                              <span>Hot off an exciting weekend of tons of news from Star Wars Celebration 2022, including the reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and details about The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, a new trailer for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch has arrived. 
In it, we get new looks at the Bad Batch, of course, as well as Darth Sidious aka The Emperor and Wookiee Jedi youngling Gungi. With a look at Gungi, we now know that he survived Order 66, which sought to kill and end the entirety of the Jedi. The trailer also reveals that we can expect Season 2 of The Bad Batch to drop onto Disney+ this fall. 


As you can see in the trailer above, the titular Bad Batch of heroes are still doing their thing, searching for what they want to do now that they’re free. Of course, meanwhile, Sheev Palpatine’s empire is on the rise and the crew will need to deal with that while extending their helping hands to others. It looks like they’re after new allies, too, which hopefully includes Gungi. 
For more about Star Wars, read about the newly announced series, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, which will star Jude Law, and then read about how the Rogue One prequel series, Andor, will hit Disney+ in August. After that, check out the first ever Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer.

                              <span>Everyone has that Elden Ring boss they really enjoyed facing off against, even if they kicked your butt over and over again, including the game’s director and From Software CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki. 
His favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, according to a new Xbox Wire Japan blog post, as translated by IGN. As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. 


“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” 
He said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). 
“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” 


I was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player.

                              <span>After discussing a good deal on an incredibly rapid NVMe SSD, I thought I should let you know about something on the other side of the spectrum: a 500GB NVMe SSD going for just £36. This is the Crucial P2, a drive that&#x27;s been reviewed warmly here at RPS, and it&#x27;s a 34% reduction from the drive&#x27;s UK RRP.

                              <span>Readers may remember my delight over the demo for Little Witch In The Woods, and I&#x27;m happy to report that game is now out in early access. It&#x27;s already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It&#x27;s a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).
In the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It&#x27;s a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.

                              <span>To be honest, I found Computex 2022 kind of underwhelming; this is usually the biggest event in the PC gaming hardware calendar, and had returned to Taipei after an all-remote 2021 show, but ended with only a smattering of major announcements in the bag. We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.


That said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex. So, in descending order - from the interesting and sensible to the blinking ludicrous – here are the PC gaming highlights from Computex 2022.

                              <span>I feel a bit sorry for Crossfire: Legion, which appears to have suffered the worst launch imaginable for a fast-paced competitive RTS game. Since releasing last week, its all time peak of concurrent players is less than 400, and the average daily concurrents have slid down to around 100 people in only a few days. Worse, a fair chunk of this already dwindling community has been sorely narked off due to an apparent misunderstanding over how one of Legion&#x27;s key features work.

                              <span>Fast Four Word is a clever idea. It&#x27;s a Wordle-like in which you begin with a four-letter starting word and must enter a new word which changes just a single letter.

From there, you have 44 seconds to chain together as many new words as you can, with plenty of other twists to make it more challenging.

It&#x27;s a card game filled with anthropomorphic animals in medieval garb in which you can sneak and barter before or instead of scrapping. Find the trailer below.

                              <span>I like teaser trailers for Star Wars projects more than I like most Star Wars projects, so this has been a good week for me. It was capped off with the release yesterday of the first teaser trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Respawn&#x27;s sequel to Fallen Order. You can watch it below.

All the grooming parlours will be heaving with patriotic pups and pusses. Don&#x27;t forget to brew a giant pot of coronation chicken (or, like me, coronation tofu) to keep you going during the coming week of endless festivity and forced celebration. If you grow tired and that flag-waving arm starts to sag, you&#x27;ll be in for it. But first, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed a sneak peek at an upcoming music track from Splatoon 3. Nintendo describes &quot;Sea Me Now&quot; by in-universe band Front Roe as having &quot;a melodious, punkish sound&quot; that has been &quot;swimming up the charts in Splatville lately.&quot; True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon&#x27;s soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.
You can listen to &quot;Sea Me Now&quot; by Front Roe below.


The Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don&#x27;t know who the figurehead announcers of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.
Splatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9. For more on what this third entry in the franchise brings to the battlefield, check out the latest gameplay trailer here or learn about its improvements on the series&#x27; wave-based cooperative mode, Salmon Run: Next Wave, here.</span>

                              <span>Video Gameography is on hiatus this week, but in the interim, we&#x27;d like to announce the next season officially. 
Season six of Video Gameography will chronicle one of the most stylish franchises around: Devil May Cry. Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or &quot;Stylish Action&quot;). In this new season, we&#x27;ll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory&#x27;s reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here&#x27;s the complete list of games we&#x27;ll be talking about in the coming weeks:
Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 2
Devil May Cry 3: Dante&#x27;s Awakening
Devil May Cry 4
DmC: Devil May Cry
Devil May Cry 5
Video Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We&#x27;re joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. 
Last season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry.

                              <span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords is coming to Switch on June 8. This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You&#x27;ll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.
The Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.
We recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying &quot;Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables.&quot;</span>

                              <span>BD-1 is everywhere these days. He starred in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order alongside Cal Kestis, will be in the just-announced sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and may have even been in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett. This adorable droid is now getting the brick treatment with a Lego set launching this August.
Lego announced this BD-1 set at Star Wars Celebration and showed off what it can do. The set consists of 1,062 pieces and is a part of Lego&#x27;s recent droid line, which consists of R2-D2, D-O, and a Probe Droid. BD-1&#x27;s legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:
Lego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year. This set comes with minifigures of Cassian Andor, Luthen Rael, and inspector Syril Karn. The Mobile Tac-Pod is piloted by Karn.</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. Montreal has altered Batgirl’s biography in Gotham Knights following backlash about the game’s explanation for her paralysis recovery.
Batgirl AKA Barbara Gordon is one of Gotham Knights’ four playable characters alongside Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in a story that sees the Bat family defending Gotham after Bruce Wayne’s death. In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle. In DC&#x27;s 2011 New 52 comic reboot, Barbara regains her mobility due to an experimental surgery followed by physical therapy/training.

                              <span>SPOILERS AHEAD!
Obi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, you should avoid going any further. The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it&#x27;s unlike anything we&#x27;ve seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year&#x27;s Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.
These announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.
The trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.
Hasbro&#x27;s animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA&#x27;s head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.
Hasbro&#x27;s second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA&#x27;s back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.
Hasbro&#x27;s final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid&#x27;s personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.</span>

                              <span>Last year, several Hollywood studios plus Netflix, Amazon, and Apple sued the alleged operator of IPTV services AllAccessTV and Quality Restreams. According to a joint report filed with the court, it appears the parties are still open to settlement but something else piqued our interest. As part of discovery, the defendant wants details of the MPA&#x27;s &quot;relationship and involvement&quot; with TorrentFreak.

                              <span>Day two of Star Wars Celebration 2022 brought the first news of new Star Wars video games, and the announcement has been a long time coming. EA and Respawn Entertainment have officially revealed the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order. This new title will continue the story of force-wielder Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
A brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez&#x27;s ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert. Other notable characters are the potential antagonist who narrates the trailer…</span>

                              <span>Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. 
Yesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: 
TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.
May 26, 2022
Valve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.</span>

Evil Dead: The Game is a faithful adaptation, full of subtle and not-so-subtle homages to the classic horror series.

                              <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                              <span>When Jurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters in two weeks, we’ll see what happens when dinosaurs walk among us. Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.
The Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.
The arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).
Other new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.
Frontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.</span>

                              <span>Sony has announced a new State of Play scheduled to air next Thursday, June 2 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. 
The PlayStation Blog states the event will run for 30 minutes and showcases “exciting reveals from our third-party partners.” The post doesn’t mention first-party at all, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect updates on games like God of War: Ragnarok, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, or the rumored remake of The Last of Us.
Sony also teases that viewers will get a “sneak peek” into PlayStation VR2 games. Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.
The last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. 
We recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast. What do you hope/expect to see at State of Play? Let us know in the comments!</span>

First debuting in 2005 on Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube, the Mario Strikers series has developed a cult fan base over the last 17 years. However, in the time since that original launch, the series has only seen one additional title hit store shelves. Just two years after the launch of that first game, Mario Strikers Charged launched on Wii, but that&#x27;s the last we heard of the Mario Strikers franchise until earlier this year when Nintendo announced a new title for Switch, Mario Strikers: Battle League. While it has certainly been a long w…</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol is one of the most anticipated horror games in years and happens to be our June cover story. One of the project’s more intriguing aspects was that it canonically took place in the same universe as popular battle royale PUBG: Battlegrounds, albeit in the distant future and on another planet. As of today, that’s no longer the case.
Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. 
FYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world. It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, &amp;we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story and universe.

A lot of content originates from The Scene and organized P2P release groups. In addition, there are also solo &#x27;hobbyist&#x27; uploaders. Today we speak with a Pirate Bay VIP music uploader with more than 3,000 releases under his belt.

TorProject.org is now unblocked but as part of a new legal process, prosecutors are restating and broadening their case. Tor Browser must be banned and deleted from Google Play, they insist.

The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they&#x27;re actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.

                              <span>Friends and loved ones will agree, I have big “background character” energy. If I lived in the Star Wars universe, I wouldn’t be a Jedi or a Sith inquisitor. I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I&#x27;d be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.


Maybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment and NetEast Games have announced that the upcoming devilish MMOARPG Diablo Immortal is available for pre-load on PC today. As in, right now. It won&#x27;t launch in full until next June 2nd, but Blizzard have provided a handy ‘roadmap’ for accessing the game here. Scurry forth ye demons.

                              <span>I’ve been keeping a curious eye on AMD’s Software Preview Driver for May 2022; GPU drivers often promise “optimisations” that are rarely felt in practice, but this one genuinely sounded like a performance enhancing drug for Radeon graphics cards. In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.


This week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.

                              <span>The word that comes to mind is &quot;slick&quot;. In a genre defined by busy screens and showy light spectacles, Drainus does well to distinguish itself with such excellent animation. The enemies, and particularly the way they spill from levels like the battleship one, demonstrate some of the best sprite work I&#x27;ve seen for ages.
It&#x27;s more than just stylish, too. As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, I&#x27;m bad enough at scrolling shooters, and outright averse to bullet hell, to make me less than an authority on which are the best. But Drainus held my attention for long enough that you should definitely give it a chance.
I&#x27;m not going to do a pun about the name. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m definitely not.

                              <span>A while back I finished Yakuza: Like A Dragon and felt a little bit lost. You know the feeling, right? When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.
Not that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.

I’d only just started this job and was still setting up my email signature at the time (sorry, TF2 community), but thankfully all that shouting has finally been heard by the people who matter most. For the first time in two years, Valve tweeted through the official TF2 account today that they’re finally going to do something about the bots. My inbox is thankful.

Among the headline new features anticipated in Phase I of the update is the addition of a new 5-star event-exclusive character, Hydro bow wielder Yelan. You&#x27;ll be able to wish for her in the gacha from May 31st, but in the meantime, MiHoYo have set up a web event to let players get to know this mysterious newcomer a little bit better. Naturally, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with in-game goodies (including Primogems) for taking part.

But none stood out quite like Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos, a third-person fighting adventure set in a punk-fantasy universe. Despite only the briefest of hands-on sessions cut short by sod&#x27;s law, I simply can&#x27;t shake the game from my short back and sides-furnished skull. I think I need someone to roundhouse kick me into reality, before I fall asleep and wake up in the fantastical reams of Zenozoik for good.

This is a chonker of a roguelike RPG, in which long-held assumptions about how the genre ought to be designed are thrown away, while others are strictly obeyed.

                              <span>The launch of Supermassive Games&#x27; upcoming teen horror The Quarry is just over two weeks away now, but its online multiplayer component won&#x27;t be arriving on day one, the studio confirmed today. The announcement was tweeted by Supermassive this afternoon, saying the mode will now added &quot;by July 8th&quot; at the latest. No reason was given other than wanting to &quot;deliver the best possible experience&quot; for players.

                              <span>Players of hit vamp ‘em up V Rising have taken to the game’s Discord server to request an anti-phobia mode to make some of its creatures easier on the eyes. It seems the offending boss in this particular instance is Ungora the Spider Queen, a high-level giant arachnid (the worst kind) who’s set up a fetching gothic domicile in the Cursed Forest’s Spider Cave. According to the mission summary for Ungola: “No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.” That’s enough to put anyone off.

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show PC gaming podcast we&#x27;re talking about the best our favourite noble failures, like the time I tried to make feta and red onion breakfast muffins. Ne&#x27;er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it&#x27;s our favourite video games that made big swings but didn&#x27;t quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling &quot;jurassic&quot; properly first time; I&#x27;ve never been able too. 
Diversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew&#x27;s life could have been different if only he&#x27;d been Wookey Hole&#x27;s witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is &quot;about as big as an Alsatian&quot; and &quot;basically a bin-bag full of girders&quot;. So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.

                              <span>It&#x27;s tempting to make a bunch of jokes about Two Point Campus in the vein of, &quot;A nudist knight and a wizard studying the dark arts? Sounds like my freshman year!&quot; and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It&#x27;s also tempting to say something like, &quot;You know Two Point Hospital? It&#x27;s like that, but at a university,&quot; but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios&#x27; previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

                              <span>When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, &quot;No, see, it&#x27;s actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!&quot; There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn&#x27;t love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like &#x27;prestige&#x27; horror like The Babadook.
I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

With a name like that you’d expect something pretty big and, lo, the space whales have arrived. You’ll be able to recruit these leviathans for your capital ship’s frigate fleet, and even keep a baby version as a pet inside your base. Witness them in the trailer below.

                              <span>Remember when it emerged that the folks behind DC Universe Online were working on a Marvel MMORPG back in November? You know, the one that was being led by Jack Emmert, co-founder of Cryptic Studios and designer of City Of Heroes? Well, hope you weren’t too excited because it’s been cancelled by parent company Enad Global 7.

                              <span>Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going &#x27;cheap&#x27; on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you&#x27;ll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you&#x27;re forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

                              <span>No stranger to Star Wars or the annual celebration happening right now in Anaheim, CA, Harrison Ford made a surprise appearance at the Lucasfilm Showcase today, but he didn&#x27;t show up for a space-faring adventure this time around. Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.
Ford&#x27;s segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. &quot;I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,&quot; said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. &quot;I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I&#x27;ll be seeing you around campus.&quot;
Ford says they&#x27;ve almost finished the next Indy film. &quot;I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,&quot; who is also here. &quot;I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I&#x27;ll be seeing you around campus.&quot;
May 26, 2022
Before leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today&#x27;s panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?
Right now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.

Following the announcement, the folks behind the Indiana Jones Twitter account posted the first image of the film of Jones crossing what looks to be an old, rickety bridge in a dark cave. Classic Indy.</span>

                              <span>Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show&#x27;s cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.
The teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor&#x27;s life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna&#x27;s Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O&#x27;Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.
“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor
May 26, 2022
The opening panel for this year&#x27;s Celebration wasn&#x27;t streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.
Andor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.

                              <span>The first season of The Book of Boba Fett almost transformed into the third season of The Mandalorian, so we haven&#x27;t been away from Grogu, Luke Skywalker, and Din Djarin for too long. The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season won&#x27;t hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. 
This news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series&#x27; creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of Ahsoka to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.
Filoni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. This Disney Plus show is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will star Jude Law. It&#x27;s yet another project touched by Favreau and Filoni and also has Jon Watts and Christopher Ford serving as executive producers. You can see the official teaser image below:</span>

                              <span>Supermassive Games’ The Quarry launches in just a couple of weeks and serves as a campy (as in a literal summer camp) spiritual successor to Until Dawn. While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.
The studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.

The full statement reads as follows:
While a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. 
The Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here. Be sure to also read about how you can finish the game without pressing a button.</span>

Describing Italy as a &quot;country of freeloaders&quot;, he says those supporting the illegal market must be stopped. Meanwhile, Hollywood is urging the European Commission to take action against one of Serie A&#x27;s key sponsors, which also stands accused of supporting piracy.

                              <span>Roller Champions is a free-to-play rollerbasketderbyball mash-up that&#x27;s been a long time coming. I mean, Matt Cox (RPS in peace) said it was the best game at E3 2019 when it was due out in early 2020. Then it got delayed to early 2021. And now the game&#x27;s first season has - *double checks* - finally arrived.
So, Ollie, Liam, and I strapped on our skates and jumped into a few games to see how it&#x27;s getting on. Ollie had some experience with the game before, while Liam and I went in totally blind. We all emerged from our play sesh glowing with praise albeit with a tinge of worry. Would it get any traction, or quickly succumb to the cheery sports game curse?

Developers Stunlock announced the changes on the V Rising Discord and Twitter this morning. It looks fairly straightforward to enable the new mode so I’ll run through that for you.

                              <span>Karl Fairburne, the titular Sniper Elite, is a pro at pinging baddies in the distance. The master of shooting Nazis in the balls across hundreds of metres. It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

It’s no lightweight implementation either, combining both ray traced reflections and sun shadows that can really spruce up the game’s already-gleaming murder sandboxes. It’ll please shiny floor enthusiast Katharine, put it that way.

Homebody will channel the slasher film aesthetic of the 1980s, a stark tonal shift from the hand-drawn cheesecake colourfulness of Game Grumps and Rogue Games&#x27; first collaboration, Dream Daddy. Some of the same team are back for this one though. Watch the eerie trailer below.

The remake of Infinity Ward&#x27;s famous (and infamous?) first-person shooter will release on October 28th, and Activision Blizzard decided to reveal some of its character art via the medium of a real world cargo ship.

                              <span>There are a handful of rhythm games on PC, but a lot of them are ultra-hard, anime-drenched tests of reflexes and memorisation. I like my rhythm games on the other end of the scale, containing playful minigames with silly concepts and stories. Think Rhythm Heaven. Think Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan.

Think, perhaps, Melatonin. It&#x27;s an in-development rhythm game about dreams merging with reality, and looks like exactly my thing. Watch the trailer below.

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

But then, just look at Temtem. It&#x27;s not exactly hiding its inspirations. Temtem is undoubtedly like Pokémon, but set in a world populated by other players. After a couple of years in early access, the developers announced today that they&#x27;re aiming for to hit 1.0 this September.

It&#x27;s fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don&#x27;t want to start on a downer so let&#x27;s say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

                              <span>Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

That’s the basis of Polish author Jacek Piekara’s series of novels, now set to become third-person action adventure I, The Inquisitor, from developers The Dust. Somebody probably ought to consult the Archbishop of Canterbury for the PEGI rating, like. Watch the trailer below.

                              <span>I recently got a hands-off look at The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum, Daedalic&#x27;s upcoming third-person stealth game which sees Mr Precious himself take centre stage. Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king&#x27;s abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano&#x27;s development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

Keighley made the comments in a Twitter Spaces cast over the weekend, probably to everyone&#x27;s great relief. Of course, he immediately followed up by explaining that the publishers with fewer games to show will be rolling their presentations into Keighley’s own Summer Game Fest, as well as first-party shows such as the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

                              <span>Ten years ago, Google expanded its transparency efforts by documenting all DMCA takedown notices received by the company. This was done to give the public more insight into where the &quot;free flow of information&quot; on the Internet is blocked. At the time Google spotted a massive increase in takedowns, but the real surge was yet to come.

                              <span>The ordeal of three people, who edited major movies down to 10 minutes and then uploaded those summaries to YouTube, is not over yet. After being arrested and found guilty in a criminal court last year, they now face action in the civil courts. A total of 13 companies including Toei, Kadokawa, Nikkatsu, and Fuji, say they are entitled to at least $3.9 million in copyright damages.

B&amp;H Photo is asking $699 for a reference design by Sonnet, and that&#x27;s been matched by Amazon too. That&#x27;s $30 cheaper than it was last week, and shows the continued march of graphics cards towards reference design MSRPs.

                              <span>The Logitech MX Master is an incredibly popular series of office mice, and today the latest MX Master 3 has dropped from its usual price of $100 to just $55 at Office Depot. That&#x27;s a massive discount, achieved via a combination of an Office Depot price drop to $75, a 25% off code (SELFMADETECH) and a 30% back rewards code (90893995). 
This isn&#x27;t the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

                              <span>Every kid is a goddamn dork. Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties.

                              <span>The Steam Deck only had a few weeks of getting to know Final Fantasy XIV before the latter’s 6.08 update wrenched them apart. In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

Another way to celebrate yesterday was, apparently, to release a videogame. Apico, a beepkeeping sim about adventuring across a 2D world to collect, breed and conserve bees, is out now.

The acquisition includes the original IP associated with those studios, including Deus Ex, Thief, Legacy Of Kain and Tomb Raider. 

In their quarterly earnings report, Embracer now say they see &quot;great potential&quot; in leveraging the heck out of that IP with sequels, remakes and more.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 continues to receive updates as EA Dice attempt to fix a game that felt woefully incomplete at launch. Which makes it a little odd that the marquee change in patch 4.1 is the removal of a feature: Breakthrough mode can no longer be played with 128 players, and is now limited to 64. 

Not that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

Nový Fedora Linux byl vydán sice se zpožděním, ale přeci. Red Hat aktualizoval Enterprise Linux 8 a alternativní sestavení následují. Mezi to vše se vešla vydání IPFire, KaOS nebo Proxmox Virtual Environment… a na závěr letmý pohled na ruský ALT Linux.</span>

                              <span>Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
