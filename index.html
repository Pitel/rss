Nintendo&#x27;s released all sorts of statements regarding Switch Joy-Con &#x27;drift&#x27; in recent times, and the latest one comes from the NoA&#x27;s Doug Bowser. In the same interview with The Verge - where he sort of addressed complaints about Switch Online&#x27;s N64 emulation - Doug was queried about the company&#x27;s ongoing battle against Joy-Con drift.
He reiterated Nintendo&#x27;s recent comments about how the company is continuously working on making improvements based on &quot;returned units and how they&#x27;ve worn&quot; and reminded everyone the new OLED model contains the &quot;same updated stick&quot; now available in existing models.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. After running down Samus&#x27; 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.
Released on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo&#x27;s Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime&#x27;s influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn&#x27;t survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro&#x27;s struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer&#x27;s own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>A city, lighter than air.
If you’re someone who’s roamed the streets of Bioshock Infinite’s floating city of Columbia and found yourself wondering exactly how a city like that might actually be feasible, you’re in the right place. Airborne Kingdom is a city builder that takes to the skies, tasking you with creating your very own floating steampunk city. It’s a nice little twist on the genre that makes you think a bit differently about how a city should be structured, but it’s also one that doesn’t quite fulfil its potential.
Booting up the main campaign you start off with a simple town centre, and it’s your job to begin expanding your fledgling community into a thriving utopia complete with its own council. Naturally, in order to do so, you’ll need to utilise your workers to gather resources and create new buildings and structures.

                    <span>&quot;Unfinished, buggy, game launches have become far too common&quot;.
Rockstar Games is currently being hammered with refund requests from those who purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition following a host of problems, including glitches, performance woes and – in relation to the PC version – the inability to actually play the game.
Rockstar has pulled the PC version from sale after players encountered problems with the Rockstar Launcher, but the company then stated that it would also be removing files &quot;unintentionally included&quot; (thanks, Eurogamer). These are most likely the songs that are present in the code but aren&#x27;t actually available in-game.

                    <span>The best way to search for Switch deals sure ain&#x27;t on Switch.
Most fans would agree that Nintendo’s current eShop for Switch could use some work. Sure, it serves its purpose well from a purely transactional standpoint, but there are some glaring issues at the heart of it. The layout makes it difficult to just casually browse and find interesting new titles. User reviews used to be a feature, until Nintendo decided the eShop was better off without them. Worst of all, there’s no catchy music. The company has never been completely on the ball with its online offerings, but even given the fact that the sheer number of games on the system are bound to create discoverability issues, it would be difficult to argue that its latest iteration of the eShop is also its greatest.
Luckily for us, that doesn’t mean that digital shoppers have to suffer for the duration of this generation. A fan named Michael Fairley decided to step up where Nintendo won’t and put together an impressively useful site to help Switch owners find the best prices for the games and hardware they want. Deku Deals has become the indisputable gold standard for researching any purchases on Nintendo Switch, so we thought we’d speak with Michael to discuss his site at greater length and pick his brain regarding Nintendo’s own efforts in the digital storefront space.

Goku and friends are still as popular as ever - with Bandai Namco announcing Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 have shifted over eight million units each since their initial releases. This figure combines both digital and physical sales across all platforms including Switch.
To celebrate this milestone, both games will be hosting special campaigns over the coming weeks. Here are the details via Gematsu:

We still find it hard to believe, but after multiple years, the development of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has finally wrapped up. While there&#x27;ll still likely be patches, the fighter DLC for the all-star brawler is now officially complete.
The game&#x27;s director Masahiro Sakurai last month mentioned how he no longer had to worry about what he shared on social media, and as a result, he can now reveal a bit more about his personal life. With this in mind, we present you with the latest image upload: Sakurai on a horse. At least, we&#x27;re pretty sure it&#x27;s him on a horse, he did tweet it after all...

The release of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker may have &#x27;ended&#x27; Star Wars as we&#x27;ve known it for the past four-and-a-half decades, but all it really did was tie a bow on the cinematic tales of the Skywalker clan and the nine-film saga which began way back in 1977. After all, Star Wars is never really gone.

We&#x27;re almost at the halfway point through November, and it&#x27;s been a busy old time all right. With Pokémon arriving very soon, we&#x27;ve been digging into the minutiae of the excellent Animal Crossing DLC while we have the time. Elsewhere, Twitch appeared on Switch, as did GTA Trilogy in unfortunately poor form, and we&#x27;ve also taken delivery of the delightful Zelda Game &amp; Watch, too.
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

Nintendo launched its Switch Online &#x27;Expansion Pack&#x27; premium tier earlier this month, but it&#x27;s not exactly received the warmest welcome from fans - with concerns raised about the price and value, the quality of N64 emulation, and the official trailer for it becoming the most disliked video ever on Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel.
During a recent interview with The Verge, following on from the news that Nintendo&#x27;s paid subscription service now has over 32 million members, as of September 2021 - Nintendo of America president, Doug Bowser, kind of addressed these fan complaints of &quot;poor emulation&quot; with the following response:

                    <span>I think I&#x27;ve figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I&#x27;ll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and &quot;HD&quot; texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Fishing in video games is tricky to nail. Many games offer such a mechanic, but few actually pull it off. Personally, I can’t even recall a single fishing mini-game I’ve wrung enjoyment out of in the last few years. Pokémon? Tedious, annoying. Fire Emblem: Three Houses? Zzzzz. Hades?

Host Brian Shea is joined by Game Informer production director Margaret Andrews to chat about their early impressions of the new additions to the wildly popular game.

                    <span>Disney finally pulled the curtain back a bit on its upcoming Disney Plus series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, with a new behind-the-scenes sneak peek, and it teases another duel between the titular character and his old apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. 
Of course, since this series follows the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, we know that old apprentice is Anakin Skywalker no more. He’s Darth Vader now. As far as we know, Obi-Wan hasn’t yet seen Anakin as Vader in between the end of Revenge of the Sith and the start of this series so it seems we’ll get to see them meet for the first time on-screen. 
We’ll also get to see Obi-Wan actor, Ewan McGregor, share the screen with Anakin actor, Hayden Christensen, for the first time in years during this series. Neither of these actors has ma…</span>

                    <span>Disney+ Day happens but once a year, not just to celebrate the anniversary of the streaming service, but to show what viewers can look forward to in the coming months and years. Today&#x27;s announcements had plenty for Marvel fans to look forward to including new shows, continuations of recent favorites, and revivals of long-dormant series.
While there wasn&#x27;t any actual footage shown of any of the following shows, there&#x27;s a lot to be excited for. Shows like Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk are still on track to hit the service. All three have teasers shown here (at the 11:50 mark) if you&#x27;re a Disney+ subscriber. 
Making a surprise reappearance is X-Men &#x27;97, a continuation of the 90&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoon which is slated for release sometime in 2023. I Am Groot is another animated seri…</span>

                    <span>In honor of the first anniversary of the launch of PlayStation 5, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan took to the PlayStation Blog to take a look back at the year that was as well as what&#x27;s to come.
Even for a year where it felt like PS5 consoles were hard to find (and still are!), gamers put in plenty of time on the now-current gen device. &quot;PS5 gamers have collectively played more than 4.6 billion hours of gameplay on PS5 and broadcast more than 26 million hours of content,&quot; Ryan boasted. No doubt there&#x27;s been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. 
Fortnite
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
FIFA 21
NBA 2K21
Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
Destiny 2
MLB The Show 21
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Demon’s Souls
NBA 2K22
It&#x27;s great to see Miles Morales and Demon&#x27;s Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they&#x27;re day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. 
Jim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.
Despite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it&#x27;s had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find one in the coming months.

                    <span>Now That Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is out in the wild, fans and newcomers are enjoying improved versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. While the games are a blast on their own merits, many fans remember punching in the copious amounts of cheat codes to make each title even more delightfully absurd. Most of these cheats apply to the Definitive Editions and we&#x27;ve gathered all of them here in one place. 
To activate the cheats, simply enter the correct button prompts while in-game. Keep in mind that Rockstar has already warned that an unspecified &quot;couple of cheats&quot; have been removed from The Definitive Editions due to technical reasons. If a code doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s likely the reason. Also, using cheats will lock certain trophies/achievements so be sure…</span>

                    <span>There are movie franchises that will likely never take a break – Halloween, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and despite what Vin Diesel says, probably Fast &amp; Furious, to name a few – and it seems Predator is one of them. 
That’s because a new Predator movie is due out next year, as reported by IndieWire on Twitter. Titled Prey, it’s being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane director, Dan Trachtenberg, and it will stream on Hulu sometime in 2022. It’s unclear based on IndieWire’s wording if the movie is streaming exclusively on Hulu or if it will simply stream on the service and hit theaters next year. 
The new #Predator movie from &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; director Dan Trachtenberg is officially titled #Prey and will stream on Hulu in 2022. The film is set 300 years ago and follows a skilled Comanc…</span>

                    <span>Developer People Can Fly will air its first Outriders Broadcast since the game launched on April 1. The presentation will give fans a peek at a “colossal” free content update hitting the cooperative shooter in the near future.
People Can Fly provides no other hints as to what this update entails. If you’ve enjoyed Outriders and the idea of playing more of it sounds appealing, you’ll need to tune into Square Enix’s Twitch channel this Monday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific/12:00 p.m. Eastern.  
Outriders has been relatively quiet the past few months in terms of major updates. Outside of squashing bugs, stabilizing servers, and tinkering with loot drops, People Can Fly has kept any big expansion plans close to the vest until now. The game has felt a bit forgotten as a result despite earning a 9 out of 10 review score from us at launch. Outriders is an entertaining co-op shooter, especially alongside friends, so we’re excited to see what People Can Fly has in store. 
Outriders is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC. The game is also part of Xbox Game Pass on both console and PC.

                    <span>If you’ve ever lost in a round of Fortnite right at the end and feel the need to scream and implode into fire, good news: there’s a skin now available in Fortnite for you. 
It’s the Dark Phoenix skin, and X-Men fans will recognize her as the Phoenix seen throughout the Dark Phoenix Saga, a run of comics that ran in 1980. You might also recognize Dark Phoenix from the 2019 X-Men movie of the same name. Regardless, if you’re a fan of the more explosive variant of Jean Grey, this skin is for you. 
&quot;I am Fire and Life incarnate! Now and forever - I am Phoenix!&quot;

As you can see in the tweet above, the skin and accompanying items are now available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop. Her set features the outfit, the Phoenix Force back bling, and the Rising Phoenix Emote. You’ll also receive the Wrath of the Phoenix Loading Screen with the set as well, according to Epic Games. 
Dark Phoenix joins other skins recently added to Fortnite such as Jinx from League of Legends, which represents the first time a League of Legends character has appeared in a non-Riot franchise, and Naruto, although this was a collaboration tease and we’re still in the dark about what’s actually coming from the Shippuden series.

                    <span>Update, 11/12/2021, 10:47 a.m. EST:
In a rare moment of financial openness, if you will, Nintendo has released some official numbers regarding its October sales of Switch consoles, Metroid Dread, and more. 
In a new interview with The Washington Post, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser revealed that the company sold 711,000 Switch consoles in the U.S. in October. Of those 711,000, Bowser says 314,000 of them were the recently-released OLED model. He also revealed that many of the Switch units sold were bought by people that already owned one and they were upgrading to the OLED or buying another for someone else. 
On the Metroid Dread front, 854,000 copies were sold in October, and Bowser says this is the best Metroid launch in series history.

                    <span>If you purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, you’re not actually able to play it at the moment because the Rockstar Games Launcher is down and has been down for nearly 20 hours. 
As first reported by IGN, Rockstar’s own game launcher went down about 18 hours ago and because that’s how PC players must access the trilogy, they aren’t able to play their new games. Rockstar has also pulled the trilogy from sale on PC so if you don’t already own it, it’s not something you can purchase at the moment. 
Rockstar Support Twitter account tweeted yesterday. “Services will return as soon as maintenance is completed.” 



Services for the Rockstar Games Launcher and supported titles are temporarily offline for maintenance. Services will return as soon as maintenance is completed.
November 11, 2021
Rockstar Support tweeted out an update 14 hours after that first tweet: maintenance was still occurring and the launcher was still down. There’s been no update since then at the time of this writing. 
Other than needed “maintenance,” Rockstar has not formally announced exactly what’s wrong or what’s going on with trilogy. Perhaps something happened on the backend of the launcher or maybe something is messed up in the code of the PC version. Hopefully Rockstar updates players on what happened when the game goes back online (and is available for purchase again). 
While waiting for that, check out the full track list available in the trilogy and then read about how Rockstar had to remove a couple of cheats from it due to technical reasons. Check out this story about how San Andreas is being developed for Oculus Quest 2 after that.

                    <span>Dice has revealed its post-launch plans for the first year of Battlefield 2042 and there’s a lot of content on the way for the multiplayer-only title. 
Battlefield 2042 is out now for those with access to its early access period, and the full title will be out for most on November 19. As you jump into the game, you’ll be treated to a sizeable amount of maps, specialists, weapons, and more, but according to a new blog post from Dice, this is just the beginning. In its first year, you can expect multiple seasons and accompanying battle passes, new specialists, and possibly some new maps.

“In our first year of live service, we will deliver four Seasons, with four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content,” Dice’s blog post reads. “We also intend to deliver updates to Battlefield Portal that will give players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.” 
Continuing in the blog, Dice says for Season 1, expect a new Specialist, one Battle Pass, and some additional Portal content. They even tease that players might see some “new sights” (presumably by way of new maps) as the story of 2042 unfolds. More details regarding that will be shared early next year, Dice says. 
“During launch, we’ll also kick off the Preseason with Weekly Missions and Rewards, Limited Time Modes, featured Creator Spotlights and experiences in Battlefield Portal, and more,” the blog post reads.

The Shin Megami series has always reflected the darkness and cruelty of the world we live in, offering a reminder that the odds are often stacked against us, and unfair circumstances can cause great loss. But it also captures the beauty of rising up against those daunting challenges to stand tall – even when things seem impossible, we somehow persevere. That’s what makes the Shin Megami Tensei franchise shine, but the road to these victorious highs is filled with demoralizing lows. Voluntarily putting your energy into something that requires extra fortitude, commitment, and patience may not seem that appetizing at first glance, but no game has made me feel the rush of victor…</span>

                    <span>Seasons come and go.
When the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Direct told us all about the new content coming in update 2.0, a lot of us wondered how to prepare our islands for all the new stuff. After all, for many of us, we hadn&#x27;t visited the game in a long time. Wouldn&#x27;t it just be easier to start fresh?
Well, yes and no. It&#x27;s easier because you&#x27;re not tied down to all the decisions you made a year ago... but it might also make your life a little more difficult. Or, at the very least, it&#x27;ll keep you playing for a while longer, if you&#x27;re a completionist.

                    <span>Wasted.
It should have been so easy, or so one would have thought. Three epic open world masterclasses that took the gaming industry by storm back in the early noughties, finally arriving on Switch and giving us all an absolute smorgasbord of hilarious criminal hijinks to dig into. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition on Nintendo&#x27;s portable console should be a marriage made in heaven. However, as it turns out, Rockstar must have been almost fully divorced from reality to let this port release in the state in which we&#x27;ve reviewed it.
The games here themselves need no introduction. Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City and San Andreas released in 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively, delivering spectacular open worlds that are absolutely oozing with edgy atmosphere, amazing soundtracks, memorable characters and hilarious slapstick action. They&#x27;re meticulously crafted slices of satircal Americana in which to run amok. That stuff is all still here, but it&#x27;s been massively compromised by a port that beggars belief, especially considering that the most recent of these games released 17 years ago.

Round is the best shape. Consider: Kirby. Mareep. Samus (sometimes). Everything is better in spherical form. But the place you can find the most roundest animals is, of course, the Pokémon games. Exhibit A:
With that in mind, check out the Pokémon Center&#x27;s new line of &quot;round and squishy&quot; plush toys, which we cannot stop thinking about.

Back in early September we covered the asobu Indie Showcase, an online event from a Tokyo-based organisation that promotes and supports independent developers. Quite a few Switch games were featured, including some that we assumed would be Japan-only titles.
BEAT! TALK! was one of the games we doubted would arrive globally, yet it turns out we were wrong. Developer Gift-10&#x27;s project is out now globally on the eShop - it&#x27;s designed to help people learn the rhythm and tempo of speaking English, with supported languages being Japanese, Korean and Chinese.

The Animal Crossing: New Horizons update is chock-a-block with fantastic things to find, and not all of them are immediately obvious. In fact, some weren&#x27;t even in the Animal Crossing Direct!

                    <span>The 3DS spin-off concept finds its true home.
Back when Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer was released on 3DS it was considered by some to be a slightly strange beast. It was enjoyable and charming enough, but its main issue was that it was a tough sell as a standalone retail game. Once you took the plunge it was a lovely time, but the designer/decorating concept didn&#x27;t sit easily with Nintendo&#x27;s release strategy.
We&#x27;re now in a different time of more powerful hardware and a far more successful and substantial eShop, and as a result Nintendo has decided to take the plunge with its first paid DLC in a mainline Animal Crossing game — aside from the monetisation in the free-to-play mobile title Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, of course. Available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack or as a standalone purchase, Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise offers a lot of content but, most importantly, integrates naturally with the main experience to give it even more depth.

RedDeerGames is a publisher that&#x27;s becoming increasingly familiar to eShop aficionados, and it&#x27;s confirmed its latest pick-up that&#x27;s heading to the Switch. It&#x27;s Little Bug which has been developed by Buddy System, an adventure platformer previously released on Steam; it arrives on the eShop on 26th November.
In incorporates some standard-looking platforming fare with a buddy that you can use for swinging around, and for our money its art style is rather attractive.

With Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl launching next week, it&#x27;s understandable that internet traffic relating to the series is riding high – and a new study has leveraged this level of interest to find out which &#x27;mon people like the most and which ones they positively detest.
Retailer Ebuyer used data from Linkfluence on the 25 most popular Pokémon (plus a few extras) to reveal which &#x27;Pocket Monsters&#x27; are generating the most conversations online – as well as those that are experiencing the most &#x27;negative&#x27; and &#x27;positive&#x27; comments.

                    <span>My name is Neo(Grip).

For gamers that tend to play their Switch more in handheld mode than docked, Switch OLED is an impressive upgrade that expands the size of the console&#x27;s screen by reducing the size of the bezel. The console itself is almost the same size as the original — we say almost because the OLED unit is a teeny 0.1 of an inch longer than the regular Switch. It&#x27;s a minor difference that is barely noticeable in the flesh or when you slide it into the dock, but one that you&#x27;ll definitely notice if you try to put the newer console into a grip designed for the original.

                    <span>Elden Ring is on my mind. When I go to bed and I close my eyes, I see giant crabs clack about. When I see a horse in a field, I think of Torrent the spectral steed. I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.
And it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.

                    <span>Listen, folks, I&#x27;m going to hold up my hands and tell you something shocking. I don&#x27;t get Dark Souls. I&#x27;ve tried to play FromSoftware&#x27;s much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I&#x27;m simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I&#x27;ve come to realise I simply don&#x27;t have the time or the patience to see it through. I&#x27;m not sure I ever will, either. 
It&#x27;s the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I&#x27;ve fallen hook, line and sinker for Death&#x27;s Door, the crow reaper sword &#x27;em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve.

Both big FPS releases of the month, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, have been at my fingertips this week and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts. Of course, Imogen hits us with news too. Valorant has another new character coming out, Fortnite pulls Travis Scott, and Imogen gives us the lowdown on just how much she&#x27;s enjoying Apex Legends&#x27; latest season.

                    <span>Rockstar yesterday launched the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, a collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas rebuilt and remastered. Today, you cannot buy it at all on PC. Given that the Internet has been abuzz with screenshots of by how bad parts of the new versions look, it might be tempting to assume Rockstar pulled it from sale for being rubbo. However, they do seem to be having trouble with the launcher software which the game requires. Hmm! Either way, the game is a mess.

Everyone else, hey, be glad that other people are paying to test the game for you so it&#x27;s in better shape later. Though reportedly voice chat won&#x27;t even be in by the time it properly launch so sheesh.

                    <span>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.
Using lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game.

                    <span>Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. 
This list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event.

If you’ve toyed around with the idea of creating a new controller in the Xbox Design Lab but were waiting for some old features to return, now is your time. That’s because Xbox has brought back rubberized grips and metallic finishes. Three new colors are available as well. 
“[We’re] excited to announce that rubberized grips and metallic finishes are returning to Xbox Design Lab with new color customization options, giving you even more combinations to choose from,” Xbox’s blog post about the announcement reads.
Here’s everything added to the lab today: 
Black rubberized grips are available on both the back case and side grips for added comfort and control.

                    <span>If you’ve been looking to watch your favorite Twitch streamers on the go (and don’t already own a smartphone), the Twitch app is now available on Switch.
Nintendo tweeted the surprise announcement today that you can download the app from the Switch eShop. Now you can watch your streamer of choice play Animal Crossing: New Horizons or complain about the Nintendo 64 emulation on the online Expansion Pack. Given the lack of many popular streaming services on the eShop, such as Netflix, the fact that Twitch made the cut is a small miracle. 
Twitch is now available on #NintendoSwitch #eShop!

                    <span>If you preordered a Playdate handheld gaming device that was set to ship this year, you’re going to have to wait a little bit longer. 
Panic Inc. announced today that its first batch of Playdates originally set to ship in 2021 have been delayed to early 2022, citing a “critical battery issue” that was caught late in the process. As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.
“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” 
Panic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. 
For more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn&#x27;t the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch.

This news comes by way of Gematsu, which reports that Extraction will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Luna, and Stadia on January 20. Ubisoft has also revealed some more information about the game’s built-in features such as cross-play and more.

“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” 
Extraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms. Gematsu reports that two Buddy Pass tokens will come with each copy of Extraction. These tokens allow you to invite two friend to play it with you for 14 days for free. If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. 
Ubisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. 
Today’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January. While waiting for it to be released, read about how its old name was Rainbow Six Quarantine (you can probably guess why it was changed) and then check out Game Informer’s Rainbow Six Siege review after that.

                    <span>After revealing Spider-Man’s design ahead of his debut in Marvel’s Avengers, we now get our first look at him in action, albeit in cinematic fashion. IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.
For those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival.

Spider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.

Halo Infinite&#x27;s upcoming release marks an exciting time for Xbox fans the world over. The return of Master Chief is shaping up to be an exciting affair and we&#x27;re giving you a quick 4K look at the opening mission from 343&#x27;s latest adventure!
In this clip, we find John-117 fighting off the Banished, a familiar yet new group of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites that have found their way to the Zeta Halo and are wanting to use its power for their gain. This first level of Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, but we find Chief getting back into the conflict, f…</span>

Halo Infinite is a few mere weeks away, but you don&#x27;t have to wait that long to get a new look at campaign gameplay! Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure!
There&#x27;s a ton to unpack here, but we&#x27;re showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today&#x27;s video. Throughout Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign, you&#x27;ll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that&#x27;s saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game&#x27;s most treacherous bosses. There&#x27;s no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you&#x27;ll see in the footage above). 
While you&#x27;re giving the Banished hell, don&#x27;t forget to look around. In today&#x27;s gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game&#x27;s upgrade currency that will enhance Chief&#x27;s equipment, such as the Grappleshot. 
We also get to show off one of the game&#x27;s newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It&#x27;s a Banished weapon that feels like it&#x27;s in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.
This is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343&#x27;s latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more! Thanks for watching, and we hope you enjoy the coverage!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s campaign offers two distinct paths for players; it’s one of the biggest things setting the game apart from its predecessors. As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.
However, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before. After an i…</span>

Ahead of the game’s arrival, we’re highlighting Halo Infinite with one of our biggest cover stories in years.

KOTOR was first released on the original Xbox and PC in 2003, and it was later ported to Mac, iOS, and Android devices by Aspyr Media, the studio now heading the PlayStation 5 and PC remake of the classic RPG. Due to Xbox’s overall backward compatibility support, the original version of KOTOR has been playable on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles. As of today, it’s playable on Switch.

                    <span>Expect a handful of cheats to be missing from Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. 
The GTA franchise is known for a lot of things, including cheats. These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. 
However, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. 
“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” 
USA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.
While waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.

Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an interactive cheesy sci-fi action movie, for better or worse. It boasts incredible – and wonderfully improbable – action sequences propelled by a story that barely qualifies as narrative. Infinite even has a run time that is comparable to some films. Unfortunately, Bright Memory: Infinite burns out before it fades away, peaking early and showing great promise before concluding sooner than expected.
Bright Memory doesn’t have a story as much as it has a ser…</span>

                    <span>Naruto is to the anime community what Fortnite is to gaming – a cultural phenomenon with continuous levels of popularity and success. Naruto’s fluid animation, impressive world-building, and relatable heroes have inspired fans across the globe. At the same time, Fortnite is beloved for its constant content rollouts and unexpected crossovers, with Marvel and DC being primary sources of inspiration. However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together. According to a teaser Tweet, Naruto (Shippuden, to be exact) will ninja run into Fortnite next week. Believe it!

                    <span>Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.

                    <span>If you’re someone looking for a PlayStation 5 in time for the gift-giving season, or even before the end of March, it’s now going to be even harder. 
Buying a PS5 already feels like an arduous task. Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million.

Bloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. 
The PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. 
While waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues.

                    <span>Battlefield has always been the largest, loudest, and most chaotic multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the Texas of video games, and whether you love it or hate it, its bombast cannot be overstated. For better and worse, Battlefield 2042 continues this trend, offering a dizzying amount of on-screen explosions, firefights, and objectives to capture. The game’s 128-player matches and gargantuan maps guarantee dramatic moments – and some of my favorite gaming clips from 2021 – but there’s a thin line separating spectacle and confusion. 
There’s never been a Battlefield game released without Conquest, the signature mode which tasks two opposing teams to capture and defend objective zones across the map. The popular match format is alive and well, but honestly, it’s my least favorite w…</span>

                    <span>Starfield is a very long way away - actually, it&#x27;s set to release exactly one year from today. We know a little about Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming space RPG already, and last night director Todd Howard revealed a few more titbits about what&#x27;s in store. During a Q&amp;A on Reddit, he talked about the game&#x27;s character creator, mod support and potential robot companions, as well as mentioned that the developers plan on showing more Starfield next summer.

                    <span>I&#x27;m once again back, and I&#x27;m badder than ever! To mark my triumphant return to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, I (Alice) suggested we talk about our favourite non-game celebrity appearances in games. Not because I&#x27;m very famous and important, although I am, but because I wanted to spend some time making fun of Chris Pratt.
In the end, though, we don&#x27;t talk much about Chris Pratt, partly because we are so very excited to be joined on the pod by &#x27;Bath&#x27;s Nic Cage&#x27;, and discuss the time he turned on Bath&#x27;s Christmas lights, and partly because we do talk about a lot of games this week. I hope you&#x27;re all proud of us. We&#x27;re showing personal growth. Digressions this week include Harrods department store, a lot about Garfield, and Nate doing fat rips on his vape.

                    <span>If Bright Memory: Infinite has one thing, it’s bombast. It’s a game where at one point you jump and electro-grapple onto an in-flight plane as it careens into a black hole, but it’s also a game where you can easily miss the poorly telegraphed jump three times in a row and wind up having to slog through the same brief firefight again and again. 
This is a short, linear shooter about riddling high-tech corporate goons and ancient mythical chinese warriors with bullets and blade wounds - a shooter that’s left me both razzled and dazzled, but not without reservation.

                    <span>The team behind much-beloved XCOM mod Long War today announced they&#x27;ve delayed the launch of their own alien invasion strategy game, Terra Invicta. It&#x27;s now due in spring 2022. Pavonis Interactive state the usual reason: they want more time to make it good. Please do! After Long War, I certainly want to see them smash it with an ambitious game spanning the entire solar system. For now, a new trailer shows some of their recent work, including 3D space fleet battles and giant alien beasties destroying cities.

                    <span>Ahead of Skyrim Anniversary Edition&#x27;s launch, a developer behind a vital modding tool warned that the release might also break mods for Skyrim Special Edition, badly. Well, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now, and as expected it has broken many mods. But, good news: the person who warned of this is making better progress on fixes than expected.

                    <span>One of my favourite things about the Fallout series is learning what weird and wonderful experiments took place in its vaults. There was the one where everyone lived in a VR simulation, another testing cryosleep, as well as one where a panther was let loose. The developers had more plans for these bomb-proof bunkers that never quite made it into the games though. Bethesda director Todd Howard revealed last night that Fallout 4 almost had an underwater vault with a giant octopus, which sounds slightly terrifying.

                    <span>This Battlefield 2042 review-in-progress is an odd one. Namely because my hands-on time with the game has been dictated by EA, as opposed to actual real-life sit-downs with my own copy of the game. Still, I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed what I’ve played so far and am confident that Battlefield fans will too.

                    <span>The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.


Conway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.


Within these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.

                    <span>It&#x27;s Skyrim&#x27;s 10th birthday today, so Bethesda have released yet another version of their epic fantasy RPG to celebrate. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is out now, adding a bunch of Creation Club content, like fishing, aquariums and more. Plus, owners of the game&#x27;s Special Edition will get a handful of freebies too. It&#x27;s no Elder Scrolls 6, but hey, fish are nice. So, how many copies of Skyrim will you own after today?

                    <span>If you tell me your weird take on a free idle game is about 40 minutes long, I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I may not have places to go or people to see, but I do have a lot of stuff to do (like the mandatory watching of videos about correct neutral chair posture at work). Then your browser game turns out to be a strange, sort of post-apocalypse thing about music, dancing and weird rural traditions - and harvesting a lot of corn - and I will be crouched on my chair, slavering like a little cider-swilling urchin, for the entirity of those 40 minutes.
Such a creature am I for Peter Talisman: Lord Of The Harvest, a game that fills your screen with a huge field of gently swaying corn.

                    <span>If you’re excited to see if you gel with The Gunk, you won’t have to wait much longer now as Image &amp; Form Games have revealed its release date: December 16. 
The team behind the SteamWorld franchise first announced its upcoming exploration game, The Gunk, during the Xbox Games Showcase back in 2020. Image &amp; Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December.

Now, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. 
“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” 
As noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image &amp; Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  
While waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image &amp; Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase.

                    <span>Thunderful held a showcase today featuring upcoming games from the publisher including The Gunk (which holds a newly announced December release date) and the Stadia timed-exclusive aquatic adventure Wavetale, which releases today. Capping off the presentation was a brief look at the next chapter in the SteamWorld franchise, SteamWorld Headhunter.
The teaser (which you can watch below) features two robotic cowboys featuring spectacular &#x27;staches facing off in a familiar pistol dueling position. You know, desert town, high noon, and all of that. One automaton looks to have lost the shootout, and in the process, lost his head. When the victor checks on the deceased&#x27;s condition, only to find its head is detached and flying at him with deadly intent.

Thunderful isn&#x27;t saying much about Headhunter other than it&#x27;s a direct follow-up to &quot;the (literally) earth-shattering events of SteamWorld Dig 2&quot; and will be a full 3D, co-op action adventure experience. In honor of the announcement of Headhunter, SteamWorld Dig 2 is currently free to download on Steam and GOG starting today and lasting until tomorrow, November 11 at 11 a.m. Eastern.

                    <span>Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.
The delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here&#x27;s Valve&#x27;s announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:
It looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you&#x27;ve pre-ordered one already.
While it&#x27;s disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn&#x27;t a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. 
The Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor. You can read about the device from our story on the announcement, and you can check out our suggestions on the best games to play on Steam Deck here.</span>

                    <span>Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.
As you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. 
Spidey joins the fray via the free &quot;With Great Power&quot; hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it&#x27;s tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. 
For non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix&#x27;s disappointment in Avengers&#x27; performance here.

                    <span>Industry figure Geoff Keighley has revealed that his annual gaming awards show, aptly titled The Game Awards 2021, will feature somewhere between 40 to 50 games. 
This news comes by way of a news post by Epic Games about the awards show and in it, Keighley revealed that he learned from last year’s event that “games and the trailers” are what drive the show. He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. 
“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” 
Keighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. 
The Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. 
This year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. 
While waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition launches tomorrow, and we already have a pretty good idea of how Rockstar is enhancing GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. However, the publisher shared more specifics on the changes made to its classic sandbox titles.
We know the games look sharper than ever thanks to higher resolution textures, rebuilt lighting, an increased draw distance, among other perks. Rockstar revealed that PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players also benefit from a 4K resolution/60 fps performance. 
As previously revealed, the controls have been revamped to match Grand Theft Auto V’s. Shooting and targeting have been improved, including better drive-by controls for San Andreas specifically. You can also now immediately restart failed missions instead of being kicked…</span>

                    <span>October was a big month for video games in terms of releases. It saw new titles like Far Cry 6, Back 4 Blood, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and more hit the market. It’s no surprise that many of these debuts lead PlayStation’s top downloads for the month of October, either. 
PlayStation released the top October downloads for its multiple platforms today and at the number one spot in the United States and Canada is Far Cry 6, followed by FIFA 22 in second, and Back 4 Blood in third. On the EU side of things, it’s a touch different: to nobody’s surprise, FIFA 22 was the top download with Far Cry 6 in second and Back 4 Blood in third.

                    <span>If you’ve played any Pokémon game, the more open-ended post-campaign content is often just as enticing as the linear narrative. You defeat eight gym leaders, conquer the elite four (or whatever other monikers that a specific region might use), and then enter the annals of the Pokémon Hall of Fame. Beyond this, you might unlock a new area with challenge battles/scenarios, or, in the case of Gold and Silver, you travel to an entirely new region with its own trainers and points of interest. 
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will likely come with some impressive extra features after the credits roll. Moreover, a new trailer and press release revealed Ramanas Park, an endgame nature preserve of sorts where you can catch legendaries from across the entire franchise.

After yesterday’s official launch, the new open-world arcade driving game from Playground Games hit over 4.5 million players, according to Xbox head Phil Spencer. This makes the launch of Forza Horizon 5 bigger than any Xbox Game Studios launch before it.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big one. Join Game Informer&#x27;s resident Souls expert Dan Tack, along with Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they show off some brand new gameplay from Elden Ring, the hotly-anticipated open-world coming from the masterminds behind Demon&#x27;s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro.
In this extra-long episode of New Gameplay Today, the crew pours over every detail of the world and fills you in with not only new looks at the game but hands-on impressions as well. But what can players expect when they get their hands on either the upcoming networ…</span>

                    <span>Remember the bubbling excitement surrounding Jump Force a few years back? Anime and brawler fans alike came together to either relive their favorite battles/fantasy fights across myriad series or embark on a new, ambitious fighting experience touting a sizable roster at release. I might not have purchased Jump Force when it launched back in 2019, but I remember throwing together A Short Bio Of Every Jump Force Character as a Game Informer intern. I was impressed with the sheer amount of licensed anime shows that were slated to appear in the game (and exhausted by the end of writing all those dossiers). However, early next year Jump Force’s digital availability and online services are coming to an end in the Americas.

                    <span>While many Linux users were excited years ago around EOMA68 and in part the possibility of an open, upgradeable laptop design, it has yet to ship and looking like it never will -- not to mention being very outdated specifications by today&#x27;s standards. Entirely unrelated to that prior upgradeable hardware effort but continuing in similar goals is The Framework Laptop. The Framework Laptop is a thin, upgradeable notebook that is Linux-friendly and allows the user to easily upgrade their own components. I was testing The Framework Laptop for a while and from the hardware perspective is a very nice device and running well under Linux.</span>

                    <span>Paco Rabanne describe the robot-shaped bottle for their new fragrance, Phantom, as &quot;your new wingman.&quot; The advert shows this in action, with the robot floating through a party, its behaviour on a spectrum somewhere between a &#x27;90s dancing baby meme and a horny BB-8.

This same screwtop fuckboi can now be your wingman in Curved Space, a twin-stick shmup of no particular note. &quot;It is the first time a fragrance has featured in a game as a playable character&quot; is a line from the press release. I love it, I hate it.

They&#x27;ve also put a bunch of their games on sale, including giving classic platformer SteamWorld Dig 2 away for free for the next 24 hours.

                    <span>The Gunk is a third-person action adventure from the makers of SteamWorld, set on a planet covered in a gelatinous goo. You hoover it up. It was announced last year, and we now know it&#x27;ll launch on PC via Xbox Game Pass on December 16th.

                    <span>Valve have delayed the Steam Deck, their handheld PC, until February 2022. Originally due to start shipping at the end of this year, Valve put out the announcement today that pinned the slip on &quot;global supply chain issues&quot;.

                    <span>To hell with raytracing. Nuts to your HDR. And VR, more like Very Rubbish. No, the only future graphics technology which matters is pretty water. One of the few games to understand this is Sea Of Thieves, home to some of the prettiest virtuawater you ever did see, while so many others neglect their duty to show me pretty fake water. So today I&#x27;m delighted to see that the next big World Of Warships update brings a graphics overhaul including pretty new water. It is pretty! Not Sea Of Thieves-grade pretty, but certainly a better use of resources than goggles.

In fact, we first started compiling this list about a year ago, although for reasons that will forever remain a mystery, it&#x27;s taken us until now to actually wrangle it into shape. At long last, here we are.

                    <span>Hello folks. I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward.

                    <span>Compared to many of the tabletop social deduction games which inspired it, Among Us is fairly straightforward. Goodies, baddies, and that&#x27;s it. Well, last night it took a step towards its roots with the addition of four new roles which can change how you play your character—and how you need to think about other people&#x27;s characters. Say hullo to the Scientist, the Engineer, the Guardian Angel, and the Shapeshifter.

                    <span>There’s this hip-hop track I’m a fan of called Money Dance by Rick Ross. It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there&#x27;s one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.
For three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend&#x27;s PS5 (that I, err, &#x27;borrowed&#x27;, as sadly Elden Ring&#x27;s closed network test isn&#x27;t available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you&#x27;ll be able to experience everything I&#x27;m about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.

You have until Friday to claim your copies of the spin-offs, which converted AssCreed&#x27;s sneak-o-murdering into 2.5D side-scrolling platformers. They told stories of three different assassins in China, India, and Russia across several hundred years, with art styles inspired by their setting. And right now they&#x27;re free.

They plan to bring Weta&#x27;s tools to Unity developers, which is quite an arsenal to offer in the rendering arms race against Unreal Engine.

Brice said, “I just wanna demystify to a lot of people that you don’t need this intense process to make video games.” While tools like Unity and Game Maker 2 have become more user-friendly over the years, the game making tool with the lowest barrier to entry might just remain Twine - the HTML-based text-centric dev tool that is often likened to a way to make electronic choose-your-own-adventure stories. The freedom presented with Twine has afforded many creators, especially queer game devs, the opportunity to make stunning, often shocking work - with Benji Bright among them.

                    <span>Give players a grind to unlock goodies and earn money and, rather than play the game the way the developers might intend, they&#x27;ll likely figure out the laziest and most efficient way to accomplish that. In Forza Horizon 5, this involves buying janky Jeeps. So many Jeeps. Players have figured out that an endless stream of Willys Jeeps give them a cheap way to get big spins on the prizewheel, potentially winning big money and unlocking rare cars. The game is awash with Jeeps.

Intel tímto do projektu jednoho z nejpoužívanějších kompilátorů přidává ladění pro tuto hybridní CPU architekturu, avšak jedním dechem dodává: oficiálně Alder Lake neumí AVX-512. Tak či onak by měl kód optimalizovaný pro Alder Lake dávat výhledově o nějaké to procento efektivnější běh než dosud.</span>

Další zvětšování monolitických čipů už není výhodné z hlediska výtěžnosti, takže podobě jako AMD (u Ryzenů / Threadripperů / EPYCů) či Intel (Ponte Vecchio) a další bude slepovat čipy do jednoho celku.

                    <span>There was a time when video games were largely linear affairs. You either moved up and down or from left to right in enclosed spaces. As technology evolved, so did the scope of digital worlds. Now players are regularly treated to expansive environments filled with quests, interesting characters, and horizons that stretch further with every console generation. These experiences consume dozens if not hundreds of hours, and as more of them flood the market, knowing which titles are worth the time investment has become crucial. To that end, we’ve assembled a list of 10 great modern open-world games available today to help make what can be a paralyzing decision a little easier. These are listed in no particular order and don’t necessarily represent the best games of all time. Rather, this will …</span>

I have never hated a game that I also find immensely fun, but somehow Riders Republic pulled this off. Ubisoft&#x27;s open-world action sports game begins with a promising premise: you, a voiceless action sports aficionado, arrive at Riders Ridge, a mecca for shredders everywhere. Somehow, against all laws of national parks and state regulations, multiple states&#x27; worth of national parks –  including Mammoth and Yosemite – have been reappropriated by the action sports industry for the explicit purpose of hauling ass. 
Rider&#x27;s Republic&#x27;s map looks about as great as any other Ubis…</span>

                    <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault On Dragon Keep was originally a Borderlands 2 DLC, but now it&#x27;s available as a standalone release called Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-shot Adventure. It functions as a taster of what&#x27;s to come in its successor, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, due next year.

While Dragon Keep will cost monies on Steam, it&#x27;s available for free on the Epic Games Store for a week.

Launching next week, HexTech Mayhem: A League Of Legends Story is a rhythm runner made by Choice Provisions, the studio behind the Bit.Trip games. It looks a lot like Bit.Trip, with a wee wizard running and jumping and bombing in time to the beat. As well as a spread of PC stores, it&#x27;ll be available inside the Netflix app. Innnteresting.

                    <span>It has been a long damn year, so I&#x27;d forgotten that people were making a grim Soulslike video game based on Pinocchio. Oh, but they are! And you can see that in the first gameplay trailer for Lies Of P. Some big Bloodborne vibes mixed with a bit of Sekiro, within an edgy murderworld based on the old story. As if anything could be scarier than the bit in the Disney version where the kids get turned into donkeys. But come, watch the trailer.

                    <span>It is a truth universally acknowledged (like the status of single men in possession of large fortunes viz. wanting wives) that moving house is one of the worst things to undertake in adult life. And you have to undertake it several times! The packing, the unpacking, the stuffing of old newspaper in gaps between fragile plates: it&#x27;s all hell. And comes with the creeping realisation that your life has as much meaning as can be physically stuffed into a few cardboard boxes.
An extra special high-five, then, to Unpacking, which not only makes this stressful event a delightful puzzle, but also demonstrates that your life and things actually have incredible meaning.

Today, we&#x27;re announcing one of the next game keys that will be available for existing premium subscribers: Darkest Dungeon, the exquisite gothic roguelike that&#x27;s also one of our favourite RPGs of all time.

                    <span>A Fortnite emote featuring music by Travis Scott has seemingly been removed from sale, following a tragedy at the rapper&#x27;s Astroworld festival on Saturday that killed eight people. The emote appeared in the item store&#x27;s daily selection on Sunday, then soon after Epic outright disabled that section. While they haven&#x27;t explained why, the cause seems clear.

The vast bulk of it, though, is basically Good Vibes: The Game. It&#x27;s warm, welcoming, and very silly, and is never intruded upon unexpectedly with the rest. But that tiny part is what makes the rest so important.

Yep, picked a great time to read that one. But I&#x27;m delighted to learn that a group of Fallout 76 roleplayers have formed a troupe of actors performing plays inside Bethesda&#x27;s post-apocalyptic MMO, and recently staged Macbeth inside their own version of the Globe theatre.

This is a familiar World War 2 funfair, where you’re steered through artillery strikes and down swathes of enemies like its whack-a-mole. By the time you get off, it’s all blurred into one forgettable experience. How could you emerge shellshocked, when you’ve seen it all before?

                    <span>You could argue Playground Games have just made essentially the same game at least three times in a row with Forza Horizon now, but while every previous edition had a few things you could point at to show how it was imperfect, you can’t do that here. Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come. For this level of quality to successfully cover such a massive and ambitious game world is a monumental achievement and should be celebrated with some kind of festival. A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.

                    <span>Updated over a long enough timeline, all games seemingly become the same - at least structurally. Deep Rock Galactic got its biggest ever update last week, for example, which adds a battle pass with 100 levels to advance through and new items and cosmetics to unlock. 

There is a twist, at least: the battle pass is 100% free, and there&#x27;s a new robot-battling mode included in the update, too.

Lag always seemed fair to me given the sprawling, complex bases you can build in the game, but the latest patch might make things better. Version 1.1.46, released this Saturday, makes several changes which should reduce multiplayer latency.

Thankfully, Left 4 Dead creators Turtle Rock have detailed more of the post-launch plans for their new zombie-smashing shooter, laying out the content roadmap for the next few months and into next year. Before paid expansions start rolling in 2022, this year we should expect to see new free stuff including a solo offline mode with progression, a new card type, new cards, and more.

Over the last week or so, the developers have been celebrating the arrival of the show in other games too, with Jinx-themed Valorant skins and even a crossover with Fortnite. The festivities are carrying on this week in League Of Legends and Legends Of Runeterra as well, with new &quot;interactive experiences&quot;, game modes and more.

                    <span>Well, here’s a bit of a bum note in the otherwise upbeat tune of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs: the new chips are apparently tripping up games that use Denuvo DRM. Not all of them, fortunately, but Intel has listed over 50 games that might suffer compatibility issues across Windows 10 and Windows 11 when using an Alder Lake processor. These include big names like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Total War: Three Kingdoms. (Update - Fallen Order has now removed Denuvo completely, so should be fine.)

Konami have announced that starting today, they plan to temporarily remove MGS2 (and 3, though that&#x27;s not on PC) from digital stores while they renew licenses for historical footage used in the game. They plan to start selling them again once the licenses are renewed, but that would require Konami successfully accomplishing something, and do you really trust them to do that?

                    <span>Comedian Dara Ó Briain has an old bit where he talks about video games, and the difficulty barrier that games have compared to other kinds of media. &quot;You cannot be bad at watching a movie. You cannot be bad at listening to an album. But you can be at playing a video game. And the video game will punish you, and deny you access to the rest of the video game.&quot;
Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;m not about to take out a cane and start hammering away at the skeletal, equine remains of the &quot;difficulty in games&quot; debate. But I always remember that joke. I like him miming a book quizzing you on what the major themes of the text are so far, and then woomp-ing closed if you can&#x27;t answer, and I thought of it again recently while playing Inscryption.

Previously due on the 23rd of November, it&#x27;s now expected on the 7th of December. Sounds like they need more time to work on stability, though game director Naoki Yoshida&#x27;s explanation was a little more dramatic, offering his &quot;sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused to our players and colleagues due to my own shortomings.&quot;

I spoke to Capron about what this new project will entail, and how it felt to leave Arkane after such a long career there.

In 2020, BioWare revealed they were working on a brand new game in the series, but this year they looked back on the Mass Effect trilogy remasters that came out in May. I thought that was all they had in store until the very end of the day when they tweeted a new teaser poster for the next game, featuring a crater shaped like a giant geth head. Geth! Mass Effect trilogy villains! Get your goggles on, reader, it&#x27;s time to investigate this pic.

                    <span>At the end of a week in which publishers Square Enix publicly expressed disappointment with how Marvel&#x27;s Avengers went down, the game has some good news: one of the most popular Marvelmen will swing in later this month, Spider-Man. Oh. But he&#x27;s exclusive to the PlayStation version. Oh no. That&#x27;s not feel-good news to lift spirits at all.

                    <span>E4 have dropped the first trailer for their GamesMaster reboot, showing a quick blast showing of competitive gaming, and an orby hologram of a man. GamesMaster was an old TV show in the 90s hosted by Dominik Diamond where they&#x27;d review games, give out tips, and get celebrities to compete in gaming challenges. The reboot seems to have more of that good stuff, and this time around will be hosted by Robert Florence.

                    <span>Planet Zoo is celebrating its two-year anniversary with a free update that adds black and white ruffed lemurs, and a new cake shop. I&#x27;m very excited, lemurs are my favourites! I went to the IRL zoo last month and the lemur walkthrough was closed, which was absolutely gutting. But if I can&#x27;t have real lemurs, you can be damn sure I&#x27;m adding some of these fluffy fellas to my virtual enclosures.

                    <span>Yes, it&#x27;s a shotgun list. No, we won&#x27;t be doing rocks or paper next. You can put that line back in your little joke sack. If I see any of you besmirching my thoroughly researched and vigourously typed article with such a low-hanging jest, I will take one of the following mortality transmission devices, be it the double barrelled murderspout of Doom 2 or the loud-mouthed body vaporisor of F.E.A.R, and I will demonstrate their crimson purpose. 
Sit down. Here are the best shotguns in video games.

                    <span>Fittingly for Fireworks Night, Call Of Duty: Vanguard launched in the wee hours, bringing a great many big explosions as the first-person shooter series returns to World War 2 once again. Along with yer usual story campaign and multiplayer modes, it has Treyarch&#x27;s Zombies too. Though I do suspect the part of Vanguard many want isn&#x27;t out yet, and they won&#x27;t even pay for: the new Pacific island map coming to CoD: Warzone at a later point.

                    <span>Previous generations worried that humanity would be hurried towards its demise by nuclear war. My fear is that our destruction will be brought about by FIFA players opening Ultimate Team packs to &quot;earn&quot; NFTs. 

Yes, EA CEO Andrew Wilson followed in Ubisoft&#x27;s footsteps by saying that he thought NFTs and play-to-earn would be &quot;an important part of the future of our industry.&quot;

The Sims 4&#x27;s Blooming Rooms kit feels designed for me. It&#x27;s one of Maxis&#x27;s new micro-DLCs, and it lets you pack rooms with flora without the need to keep the alive through knowledge or effort.

                    <span>Hey podcast fans. Mum’s away this week, which means the inmates have taken over the asylum once again. The temptation was to play another round of Sweeten The Deal, but instead Nate and I were good little podcast boys and delivered a surprisingly on point discussion of our favourite videogame adaptations of literary works. Well, I say ‘on point’; there’s a fair amount of discussion of new Dune, too, which is what got us thinking about successful book to screen journeys. Sadly, the House Atreides bagpipe band were not available for a rousing rendition of the podcast theme.
There’s also a micro Cavern of Lies in which things get biblical.

Amazon say they&#x27;ve banned many players who were spamming chat advertising their illicit services. They also blasted a blog post talking about many of the issues concerning players, explaining things, detailing plans for fixes, and other welcome news.

Well, lock me in one of this game’s hundreds of boots and take me away, because it’s both tonnes of fun and genuinely, magnificently gorgeous. Here’s how Forza Horizon 5 runs on PC, and which settings to tweak if you want a performance boost without cutting too deep into that top-notch fidelity.

                    <span>From Software and Bandai Namco have treated us to a new Elden Ring gameplay trailer, which showed off 15 glorious minutes of exploration. All I wanted was one laugh and I got it, from a rotund POT-BOY at that. Plus, it was narrated by a guy who sounded suspiciously like SoulsTuber VaatiVidya as the Tarnished trotted and fought and summoned and stealthed. Undoubtedly a showstopper of a trailer, but the higlight for me was how good the action sounded. And boy, it sounded good didn&#x27;t it?

Bloodborne PSX turns FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG into a low-poly spookfest, complete with crackly old sound effects and 16-bit music.

                    <span>Darkest Dungeon 2, the sequel to Red Hook Studio&#x27;s gothic roguelike, is a somewhat familiar affair. It&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s tough, and a narrator likes to remind you of those things frequently. But this time around, we&#x27;re leaving the Ancestor&#x27;s squalid hamlet behind, and swapping it out for a stress-fueled stagecoach. Heroes are no longer cannon-fodder to send out on doomed expeditions, but vital team members who have stories to share and relationships to forge. 


I recently talked with creative director Chris Bourassa and design director Tyler Sigman about why they decided to take the game in this new direction, the difficulties of switching to a relationship-based affliction system, and why they&#x27;re excited to be working in early access again.

                    <span>After taking a deep breath, Sega have shouted a large amount of news about Total War: Warhammer 3&#x27;s launch. For starters, the release date is February 17th, 2022. For main course, folks who buy it within a week of launch will get the Ogre Kingdoms DLC for free. And for dessert, it will be in Xbox Game Pass For PC. A fair meal, there.
