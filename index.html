                              <span>Heroes and villains slam the digital tabletop next month
Nuverse and Second Dinner are bringing the heroes and villains of Marvel to the card arena next month. Digital card battler Marvel Snap hits PC and mobile on October 18.
Announced today during the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase at D23 Expo, the free-to-play card game will feature over 150 cards at launch and more than 80 different locales for digital dueling.
Marvel Snap is being developed by Second Dinner, a studio founded by several former Hearthstone developers. In its reveal back in May, the team assured that while Marvel Snap is free-to-play, every card will be available through gameplay.
Probably shouldn&#x27;t let Thanos play Snap
One of the key mechanics in Marvel Snap is the titular &quot;snap&quot; move, allowing players to effectively double-down. It&#x27;s a bluffing mechanic that reminds me a lot of Gwent, and could add an interesting dynamic to play.
Second Dinner is also advertising fast play sessions, at just three minutes a pop. Seems like the idea is to pick up and play quickly.
Considering the way Hearthstone dominated the digital card landscape so fast, I&#x27;m interested to see what this team puts together. With the whole Marvel universe behind it for fodder, the team certainly won&#x27;t lack for interesting characters to toss in. Fingers crossed for some Squirrel Girl.
If you want to keep up with the game and be ready to grab when it&#x27;s live, you can pre-register over on the Marvel Snap site here.
Marvel Snap debuts for mobile and PC on October 18.

                              <span>From Mike Bithell
Tron Identity was confirmed during today&#x27;s D23 Expo Disney and Marvel Games Showcase: and will be arriving in 2023 from Bithell Games.
Thankfully, the &quot;wishlist on Steam&quot; tease came through, and it&#x27;s live there now! Here&#x27;s the full description:
&quot;In a new Grid, forgotten by its creator and left alone to evolve without User intervention, an unprecedented crime has been committed. The Repository stands at the center of this society. In the aftermath of a break-in, the future of this Grid hangs in the balance. TRON: Identity is a visual novel adventure following Query, a detective program tasked with uncovering the mystery of what was taken and by whom. Finding yourself in a world built on unstable foundations and filled with whispered knowledge, it’s up to you to question suspects and investigate your surroundings to piece together the truth. The decisions you make will actively influence the story, with a multitude of possible outcomes, good and bad – all depending on your carefully chosen words. You’ll interact with a number of intriguing characters, and decide whether to ally with them, spurn them, or even derezz them. However you choose to deal with them, you’ll need to recover their lost memories in your search for answers, puzzling your way through defragging Identity Discs. The world of TRON is growing, and your adventure is the seed.&quot;

The game boasts an original story as a &quot;new extension of the Tron franchise,&quot; which is great news as Disney really isn&#x27;t doing anything with it at the moment. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic, but it&#x27;s become an increasingly safe bet to trust Mike Bithell.

While Q-Games is best known for the PixelJunk series, the studio&#x27;s otherworldly resource-gathering, town-rebuilding, kaiju-stopping game The Tomorrow Children left a mark. Assuming, of course, that you were around to catch lightning in a bottle back in 2016.
With an online shared-world foundation, this peculiar social action-adventure game let players roll into town to pitch in with exploration, hauling, building, and a lot of odd jobs — manual labor was kind of the whole point in this Soviet-themed &quot;alternate future.&quot;
Every task felt slow, methodical, and deliberate. But all the tedium ultimately paid off when folks worked together long enough to accomplish bigger goals. The Tomorrow Children was an entirely communal game, leading to memorable player experiences (and …</span>

Digital retail outlet Epic Games Store has announced the next two titles that it will be offering up free to all customers come September 15 — And it looks like the mood will be getting a little otherworldly, with the arrival of the ethereal Spirit of the North and intergalactic point-and-click tale, The Captain.

Released in the summer of 2020 and developed by North Carolina-based Infuse Studio, Spirit of the North is a beautiful-looking, emotive tale of a young fox, rescued from the brink of death by a ghostly vixen, an anthro embodiment of the Northern Lights, with the pair then embarking upon an epic journey through the wilds of Iceland.

                              <span>Armarouge, Ceruledge, and Klawf are the newest members of the family
In the shadow of a new trailer, it&#x27;s time for a Pokemon Scarlet and Violet reveals update, with three more creatures on the docket.
Starting at the beginning, we had the announcement of Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly, which have all been welcomed by the community; in addition to the ridable legendaries. All five of these characters are being immortalized on an OLED Switch, too. Early on Lechonk really took off, and most recently Armarouge and Ceruledge have been seeing a lot of praise, especially from Mega Man fans. A few readers even noted that they could make a great Smash Bros. dual character one day (great idea!).
In any case, it looks like a good spread so far, and you can see all the new Scarlet and Violet additions in one place below. I think I can vibe with pretty much everyone so far? Though I have to admit, my usual grass starter plan is a little mixed up with Fuecoco in the running.
Nintendo has a running list here on the official site, if you want to dig into info on any specific creature.

CD Projekt Red updated Cyberpunk 2077 with patch 1.6 this week, adding crossover content and a host of fixes. But a tool was also tucked into the patch: official mod tools for Cyberpunk 2077.
In patch 1.6 (via Eurogamer), REDmod is set of new modding tools for CD Projekt Red&#x27;s open-world RPG. It&#x27;s a free DLC that adds &quot;integrated upport for installing and loading mods&quot; into Cyberpunk 2077.
The REDmod also adds new modding tools which can be used specifically for Cyberpunk 2077. These tools can be used to create things within the world of Cyberpunk, ranging from custom sounds and animations to scripts. CD Projekt Red says it will keep REDmod continuously updated alongside game patches, to ensure compatibility.

Making a mod
If you&#x27;ve been following the PC scene for Cyberpunk 2077, you&#x27;re probably already aware of some pretty good mods out there. I&#x27;m personally a big fan of the one that makes the metro a real, rideable metro. Future trains are cool!
So how does this work with CD Projekt&#x27;s modding tools? Well, NexusMods has a helpful page dedicated to this exact situation.
New mods will require a specific format to be compatible with the REDmod application going forward. Cyberpunk 2077 will still support loading old mods from the archive folder, but they will not appear in the REDmod menu.
For users, NexusMods says the most crucial thing to know is that old mods still work. And for authors, there is documentation on the Cyberpunk website for the new tools.
I&#x27;m interested to see how modders receive this, and what they&#x27;re able to do with the new tools. That said, more mod support is hopefully a good thing. As much as CD Projekt Red can do in supporting the game short-term, we&#x27;ve seen what mods can do for games like Skyrim.

Tableturf Battle is the standout new mode in Splatoon 3, and as promised, it involves decks of cards. Here&#x27;s where to find it, and how to play it.

Where you can access Tableturf Battle and what level you need to be
If you&#x27;re just starting up in the default hub city position: walk up the stairs and hang a right to get to the alley, then walk down it to the left. Alternatively (as seen in the third image above), you can run through the street of shops on the right, then hang a left, and another left to locate the Tableturf Battle Dojo table. You need to be player level four to interact with the NPC, which is roughly half an hour or so of turf war multiplayer. This same requirement applies to Salmo…</span>

                              <span>You can snag a bag and a sticker set
Nintendo just put out a set of physical Splatoon 3 rewards in the US to celebrate its launch today, and you can choose from two options at the moment.
The Splatoon 3: Splatsville Shopping Bag is 800 Platinum Points for a bag clocking in at 15.35” x 15.35” x 10.62”. Here&#x27;s how Nintendo describes it: &quot;Shop &#x27;til you splat with this roomy and reusable shopping bag inspired by the Splatoon 3 game. The full-color design around the exterior features stylish ink splats, brand logos, and more from the world of the Inklings and Octolings. Wrap your tentacles around the two colorful cloth handles for ease of carrying (or maybe even hanging the bag...on a hook?).&quot; There is definitely no shortage of bags at My Nintendo! It&#x27;s like a cottage industry over there.
The Graffiti Sticker Set is 400 Platinum points, and are 5.5&quot; H x 12&quot; L per sticker sheet: &quot;Splat up your surfaces with this set of stickers inspired by the Splatoon 3 game! Featuring 49 durable die-cut stickers across three sheets, this reward can be a great way to add a fresh touch to your notebook, skateboard, helmet—or whatever else you can think of!&quot; Stickers have been less plentiful than bags, but there&#x27;s been a few offerings since My Nintendo was launched; including an original Xenoblade sticker set.
There&#x27;s also a Splatoon 3 contest going on right now through October 5 at 2AM ET. You can spend up to 30 Platinum Points (10 per entry) to attempt to win the sweepstakes, which involves a prize pack of a mini locker (meant to replicate the in-game mechanic), a Switch case, a backpack, and a water bottle.

                              <span>Plus some new challenges to tackle
The next expansion for Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin adds a new job, dungeon, and more. Wanderer of the Rift brings in the Blue Mage and sees Jack take on a Final Fantasy classic in Gilgamesh.
Shown off in a new trailer, Wanderer of the Rift arrives on October 26. It&#x27;s also only available through the season pass for Stranger of Paradise.
Wanderer of the Rift adds the Labyrinth of Dimensions, a new dungeon that randomly reconfigures its rooms. A new class of enemies will also be added, and these Chaotic Monsters will add an extra bit of difficulty for those looking for a challenge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zehOwIgecBk
The warrior Gilgamesh also makes an appearance. First showing up in Final Fantasy V, Gilgamesh is a frequent recurring character in Final Fantasy series.
Alongside all this, the Wanderer of the Rift expansion also adds the Blue Mage job. I always dig a fun Blue Mage option in games, and it makes sense for post-launch DLC for Stranger of Paradise, adding a good reason to jaunt back around looking for monsters.
Getting even stranger
This is the second of three planned expansions for Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The first, Trials of the Dragon King, also added some new jobs, story content, and a higher difficulty mode.
Different Future is the third expected expansion. All three are part of the season pass, which you&#x27;ll need to pick up if you want more Stranger of Paradise content.
In our review of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Chris called it one of the &quot;weirdest&quot; games he&#x27;s reviewed in a while. And having played a good chunk of it myself, I&#x27;d have to agree. But it&#x27;s nice to see the chaotic, bizarre action of Stranger of Paradise get even more crossovers and content. I mean, Gilgamesh just makes sense for it, right?
Wanderer of the Rift is out on the Stranger of Paradise season pass on October 26.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll need to go there after you finish the campaign
The Splatoon 3 terminal is an easily overlooked menu that you otherwise never really have to interact with, but it can be crucial for a few select things. One of them is picking up periodic rewards.
The main terminal is right next to the queue system in the training lobby
Head to the lobby room (where you can queue for turf war and ranked), and interact with the terminal/PC right there. That&#x27;s it! The game doesn&#x27;t explicitly tell you where the terminal is, so it might take you a while to locate it.
So one core use of this is to pick up gifts after the campaign. By finishing the main story quest (and defeating the final boss) you&#x27;ll instantly get access to a few cosmetics and the main weapon from the campaign. You can pick those up at the terminal.
You might also locate some objects, like bonus tickets, locker items, or Tableturf Battle (card game) packs in the campaign. If you&#x27;ve just come back from a story session and happen to be in the lobby, head to the terminal and double-check to see if you have anything. Just click the gift box icon and a pop-up will show you what you &quot;Found in Alterna.&quot;
All of this is for that one person who will spend 15-30 minutes looking for a mystery box in the city hub!

                              <span>Battle Royale port to be unveiled September 15
Activision Blizzard has officially announced Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, a pint-sized port of its immensely popular battle royale shooter set within the Call of Duty universe. The official unveiling of the title will take place during the &quot;Call of Duty Next&quot; live stream, scheduled for September 15.
Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will be looking to capture Warzone&#x27;s intense Last Person Standing gameplay and nail-biting combat and then squeeze it down to fit in the palm of your hand. While undeniably a mammoth task, the Call of Duty franchise has already proven itself capable of such a feat with the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, which currently boasts a staggering 56 million players.

Call of Duty Next will offer up a supply crate full of info on all the coming and current releases in the billion-dollar shooter franchise. Alongside Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile information, fans can expect more details pertaining to this year&#x27;s entry, Modern Warfare II, as well as various updates on the mainline edition of Call of Duty Warzone and the remaining DLC for 2021&#x27; Call of Duty: Vanguard.
Call of Duty Next will premiere on Thursday, September 15 at 09:30 PT / 12:30 ET / 17:30 BST. It can be watched live over on the brand&#x27;s official YouTube channel, as well as its related social media outlets.

                              <span>Lara&#x27;s coming home
Some legendary gaming franchises are now back under the control of their respective studios, following the completion of Square Enix&#x27; western studio sell-off to holding company Embracer Group — With the completion of the deal, several IPs now defer ownership and/or creative control to their developers of origin.
The two biggest titles to make the transition of legendary adventure series Tomb Raider, which is now back in the hands of Crystal Dynamics, and dystopian cyberpunk series Deus Ex, which has come home to roost with Eidos Montreal (formerly Square Enix Montreal). In addition, Crystal Dynamics regains ownership of Legacy of Kain, while Eidos Montreal retakes the helm of cult stealth series, Thief.
The sale comes at a perfect moment in time for Crystal Dynamics, as the studio is about to embark on the development of a brand new Tomb Raider title, one that will harness the power of modern platforms and the stunning Unreal 5 engine to create a world of exploration and adventure like none Ms. Croft has ever encountered before. With Crystal Dynamics now fully in the driving seat, this bodes incredibly well for the return of both Lara and Tomb Raider — As for Deus Ex, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.
While it is understandable then many are feeling trepidation at the current craze for mergers and acquisitions that are swamping the games industry, it is possible for some good to come from said sales. And putting iconic franchises back in the hands of the people who know them the best can certainly be considered a major positive from the latest in a long, long, long line of Embracer Group purchases.

If you have Splatoon 2 data on your Switch, you&#x27;ll be prompted to import it after booting up Splatoon 3, before the main menu.
As a reminder, here&#x27;s what you get:
Three Gold Sheldon Licenses (to unlock future weapons) - you&#x27;ll get this after your first online battle
Anarchy Battles (ranked) unlocked right away - to unlock this normally, you&#x27;ll need to reach player level 10
Start with higher rank (commensurate to Splatoon 2 ranking)
Match against players in your Splatoon 2 skill bracket
If you don&#x27;t have Splatoon 2 data yet, but you do own the game: play it, finish the tutorial for good measure, and wait until you load into the hub city. Quit the game and you&#x27;ll have a valid save state to transfer to Splatoon 3. Some of you may have difficulty moving Splatoon 2 save data, so if you own a different Switch than the one you played the prior game with, a fresh save will work. You won&#x27;t get the rank bonuses, but you&#x27;ll get the licenses, and access to ranked at the start. Even with a barebones save file.
In my tests, the prompt to import save data from Splatoon 2 will not happen when playing offline (proceeding from there will only give you direct access to the story mode) — you&#x27;ll need to connect to the game while online to enable the process.

When discussing video gaming’s propensity towards violence, I often say, “ballistics are easy, discussion is difficult.” Simulating the path of a bullet has been part of the video game landscape for almost as long as it has existed. However, we still struggle with creating meaningful communication. We don’t often argue with the end boss, they’re usually not in a talking mood.
I’m always intrigued to see games make an attempt at simulating discussions. At the bottom rung, a game will have you pour stat points into charisma and maybe pair it with a dice roll. You only sometimes get games like Alpha Protocol, which has a smidge more nuance. You have to read the room to figure out how to shmooze your target (into bed, hopefully).

                              <span>See what&#x27;s next for RGG Studio
Another developer is joining the list of showcases set for next week. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the developer behind the Yakuza and Judgment series, is hosting the RGG Summit 2022 on September 14.
The RGG Summit will air on Sega&#x27;s Twitch channel, going live at 19:00 JST. That&#x27;s 10:00 UTC, or 3:00 a.m. PT for those on the west coast. East coasters have it a little bit easier, with a 6 a.m. ET air time.
For those who are awake and tuned in, the stream will have live English interpretation and subtitled assets for those outside of Japan.
https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1567830960133099520
No indication&#x27;s been given yet as to what will be announced. Though, given the recent tease of some footage from the next Yakuza, that seems like a likely candidate.
The studio has confirmed it&#x27;s working on the next Yakuza game already. It will be a follow-up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and it will retain a turn-based RPG approach.
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will also be without Toshihiro Nagoshi, who left the company and has established Nagoshi Studio under NetEase. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what&#x27;s next for Ichiban and the crew, and the Yakuza series in general, if we get a glimpse during the RGG Summit.
Summer&#x27;s end gaming news blitz
That&#x27;s far from the only showcase next week, too. Next week is the 2022 Tokyo Game Show, and companies like Capcom, Square Enix, and Bandai Namco are all lined up to air streams.
Xbox and Twitch are also airing a showcase next week for ID@Xbox, too. This weekend will even have a Marvel and Disney showcase, and an Ubisoft Forward. Plus, the ever-present rumors of a potential September Direct (which may or may not be happening, who&#x27;s to say).
With the holiday season just over the horizon, seems like we&#x27;re getting one last wave of gaming news and announcements. We&#x27;ll see what RGG Studio has in store next week.

Train simulators, farming simulators, even goat simulators — here I was thinking we had exhausted all of the best simulator ideas. Well, Broken Arms Games is here to prove us wrong with their wine-making sim, Hundred Days, which is free on the Epic Games Store until next week.
The game is described as a &quot;tycoon game with a narrative twist,&quot; and has three different game modes so players can personalize their wine-making experience to their preferences. For beginning players all the way up to experts, Hundred Days gives players complete control over their own winery — from which vines to grow to choosing which yeast and bacteria to add for the fermentation process to deciding on the bottling details.
Every choice you make along the way will determine the quality and quantity of wine that you end up producing, making Hundred Days the perfect choice for any prospective winery owners. There&#x27;s even a couple of different DLCs you can purchase, like the Napa Valley expansion that allows players to &quot;explore a new American wine region,&quot; and the Grape Lab expansion that allows players to &quot;create and produce [their] favorite grape variety.&quot;

On top of the in-depth simulation mechanics, I also just love Hundred Days&#x27; art style. It&#x27;s kind of cartoony and saturated with color, and I have to admit that seeing those deep purples does get me in the mood for a wine-making experience. Finally I will be able to live the glamorous Napa Valley fantasy that was instilled in me as a child after watching the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. I don&#x27;t think the game allows you to play as a sexy Dennis Quaid who rides horses all day, but here&#x27;s hoping that&#x27;s the next expansion pack.
Hundred Days will be free to download from the Epic Games Store, along with a bundle for battle royale shooter Realm Royale Reforged, until September 15.

While not as high-profile as 1440p output and folder-esque Game Lists, there&#x27;s a somewhat buried new PlayStation 5 feature this week that will come in handy if you&#x27;re constantly digging through your trophy lists. With a newly-added toggle, it&#x27;s possible to &quot;automatically show information for all hidden trophies&quot; for any given PS5 game.
Instead of inspecting each individual hidden trophy and pressing the Square button to show its name and criteria, you can now flip a switch for a game&#x27;s entire trophy list.
As shown in my screenshot up top, you just need to head to your PS5 Trophies section and press the Options button while hovering over a game — you&#x27;ll see a &quot;Reveal All&quot; toggle. This PS5-only feature was publicized by YouTuber Mystic (via True Trophies).
I&#x27;ll definitely be using this going forward (as long as I don&#x27;t forget that it exists). I&#x27;ve never been one to care about my overall trophy count — I try to focus on games that are already clicking with me and then pursue the Platinum if it&#x27;s remotely reasonable.
It&#x27;s nice that game developers can tuck spoilers away inside hidden trophy descriptions, but plenty of people are just going to want to look them up right away, even before the first playthrough is finished. As always, options like this toggle are appreciated.
Also, yeah, I started playing the PS4 version of Resident Evil. It has been sloooow going.

The trailer also showcases roughly a minute of new gameplay, which reveals more about the strategy card game. It looks quite dynamic, with plenty of fun animations to accompany your card&#x27;s individual moves.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Marvel Snap is set to hit PC, iOS, and Android devices next month, on Oct. 18. 
&quot;The adrenaline-pumping, superpowered card battler lets fans assemble their Marvel dream team of heroes and villains and then battle their way through the multiverse to glory – all in just three-minute play sessions,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Marvel Snap is super easy to learn, but will take a lifetime for even the best of players to master. Nuverse and Second Dinner also released the game&#x27;s pre-registration page today, where players can sign up to get the latest information on the game and snap it up the moment it launches on October 18.&quot;

Ooblets offers a smile-inducing amalgamation of monster collecting, farming simulation, and relationship building. However, this delightful chill pill becomes tougher to swallow thanks to a tedious, grind-heavy progression that tests your patience in less enjoyable ways.  
The adventure whisks players to Badgetown, a quirky village where residents harmoniously live alongside Pokémon-esque creatures called Ooblets. Despite your newcomer status, the townsfolks turn to you to restore the city to its former glory. That involves tasks s…</span>

                              <span>Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. 
While exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. 
“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” 
As you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. 
There’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown.

                              <span>Foxhole hits 1.0 later this month after years in Steam Early Access, and the update will bring the most exciting possible addition to the massively multiplayer war game: trains. Also, player-built factories, and several other features which should make players focused on the logistics of warfare very happy. There&#x27;s a new trailer below ahead of its release on September 28th.

                              <span>You start out aiming to restore a princess to a throne, which naturally tempted me on her every turn to lunge onto the nearest spear for a punchline, but I will forgive Tyrant&#x27;s Blessing for circumstances beyond its control.
Like everything, it&#x27;s also a roguelike, but it&#x27;s transparent and fair enough that I can reluctantly forgive that too, not least because I&#x27;ve found myself enjoying this one the more it went on. It&#x27;s a lighter, cheerier sibling of Into The Breach that&#x27;s half tactical fighter, half puzzler, and its default difficulty setting is close to perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something less intense that will still catch you out now and then.

That&#x27;s Betrayal At Club Low, the latest game from Cosmo D, set in the same strange city as Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City. This time, it&#x27;s an honest-to-goodness RPG, full of skill checks, strange solutions, multiple endings, and so very many dice. And it&#x27;s great. And it has a demo.

                              <span>Despite lamenting the other week that the rest of 2022&#x27;s gaming calendar was looking a bit weak sauce after endless delay announcements, September is shaping up to be an absolutely monster month for indie releases right now. As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).
Part of the challenge is working out what&#x27;s worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September.

Update  - Dispatch Games has come out of the woodwork and provided a brief statement via Twitter. It promises a more indepth response at a later time today and also states it is working on releasing its games as planned.
On the off chance the tweet gets deleted at any point, it reads as follows:

When they said &quot;Pokémon! Gotta catch &#x27;em all&quot;, we all assumed that they meant catching all the pocket monsters. But actually, what they were talking about was catching all the Pokémon and Pokémon-like games out there — of which there are many. And now, at last, we have caught them all, and wrangled them into this very article.
If you are the kind of person who hates waiting for the next Pokémon game, even though they&#x27;re currently arriving at a rate of two or three a year, then these are the games to keep your eyes on the Poké Ball, to train up your A-mashing fingers, and to tide you over until the next Pokémon Thing and Pokémon Different Thing.

                              <span>Insert obligatory Nietzshe quote here.
Made in Abyss feels like an anime/manga ripe for a game adaptation, especially given its almost Happy Tree Friends-esque combination of cute visuals with incredibly disturbing violence. We finally got that adaptation in the laboriously named Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness, which manages to be quite a mixed bag. There are very good reasons to pick this game up and there are equally good reasons to pass on it; whether or not it’s worth your time will likely depend on how much of a fan you are of the series.
The narrative in Made in Abyss closely adheres to the premise of the series, which is set in a society built around an enormous abyss in the middle of the ocean. Nobody knows exactly how deep the abyss goes or what awaits at the bottom, but all sorts of powerful artifacts and riches have been found within on expeditions, which makes ‘Cave Raider’ one of the most coveted and respected professions around.

Publisher Rogue Games, which has launched Switch games such as Fisti-Fluffs and Super Mega Zero, has announced that it will be moving to a four-day work week, with employees set to have every Friday off with no additional hours added to prior work days.
The news comes via Game Developer, who interviewed Rogue Games&#x27; CEO Matt Casamassina (previously co-founder of IGN) on the huge change which comes in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Casamassina states that in the years following his time at IGN, he has tried to work &quot;smarter, not necessarily harder&quot;, and this mentality is part of what drove the decision to change the work week at Rogue Games.

With the launch of Splatoon 3 (that&#x27;s today, by the way!) and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on November 18th, Nintendo is celebrating both games with their very own Nintendo Switch: OLED Model designs. While we love both designs in their own way, we at Nintendo Life most definitely have our preferences, and we want to know yours too!
So let&#x27;s take a look at both OLED models and see what we like and dislike about each. Afterwards, be sure to vote in the poll and let us know in the comments which one takes your fancy!

                              <span>But for how long?
If there&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s defined the most recent console generation, it&#x27;s shortages. Shortages of semiconductors, parts, and other components, have led to a shortage in stock for both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles and have also affected Switch production. But we seem to have hit a turnaround if August&#x27;s monthly charts from GfK are anything to go by. (Thanks, Gameindustry.biz.)
In the UK, console sales for all three major manufacturers rose in August, but Sony&#x27;s big white tower has seen the biggest increase (a 56% stock increase), and as a result, it has now become the best-selling console in the UK in 2022. If you&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on the weekly game charts, then you&#x27;ll know that Horizon Forbidden West has been doing particularly well, and that&#x27;s because of a PS5 bundle — and it seems to have worked.

Ah, the venerable midnight launch. The once-expected tradition of camping out for midnight game launches — so timed as to technically adhere to official game street dates while still capitalising on gamer obsessions and enthusiasm — is, at least in New York City, on the verge of extinction thanks to numerous factors like public safety, liability concerns, pandemic precautions, and overall consumer welfare.
But on this date, September 9, 2022, the spirit at least lived on, thanks to Nintendo NY’s formidable RSVP system, which requires hopeful purchasers of — in this case — Splatoon 3, to log in on their My Nintendo account, and reserve a timeslot in a virtual queue to buy the game.

Getting good at Super Smash Bros. Melee (and any Smash Bros. game at that) is a matter of muscle memory. You learn the controls until your thumbs are moving independently of your mind, you merely need to think and your character attacks, and before you even register an oncoming punch, your shield is up.
What this has produced in many Smash Bros. players is an intimate understanding of our fighter&#x27;s skillset and the ins and outs of each stage.

If you were extra vigilant throughout this year&#x27;s &#x27;not-E3&#x27; season, and you like your JRPGs, then you may have spotted Alterium Shift during the 2022 Guerilla Collective showcase.

                              <span>I somehow missed that Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came to Steam back in April, 19 years after it was first released. Now Bethesda have announced that they&#x27;re launching new dedicated servers for the free World War 2 shooter, which will all run the six original maps with no mods.

                              <span>Eidos Montreal, the studio behind recent Thief and Deus Ex games, say they are &quot;now the owner of the games [we] developed, like the Deus Ex and Thief games.&quot; Likewise, Crystal Dynamics say they have taken &quot;control&quot; of its Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain games from their previous owner, Square Enix.

Which sounds like a big deal, but really both studios are just reporting a change to their terms of service and privacy notices since they were bought by Embracer Group last month.

I’ve definitely enjoyed it more than on its release in 2019, and its DLC adds more to think about and manage during what were once long lull periods. There&#x27;s a lot to like about its final form. There&#x27;s also a lot to... I don&#x27;t quite want to say hate, but I&#x27;m also not quite sure why. It&#x27;s one of the most evenly mixed bags I&#x27;ve ever rummaged around in.

AGDQ 2023 had originally been planned to take place in Florida, but that’s scrapped due to the state’s attitudes towards COVID-19 and LGBTQ+ people.

Not to worry, though, as myself and Nate are ever ready to hold down the fort. This week we&#x27;re talking about our favourite cinematics in video games, a fitting subject because last weekend I saw the greatest piece of cinema yet conceived by man: Michael Flatley&#x27;s Blackbird.
I do spend quite a lot of time explaining Blackbird to Nate, but after that we do talk about some cutscenes and cinematics in games (as well as litigating the difference between the two, and Nate tries to remember the first time he saw a cutscene in a game that was in-engine rather than being pre-rendered). And today the Cavern Of Lies is a Cavern Of Justice, after we received a troubling missive from one [squints] Brond Coatwear?

                              <span>I saw a panel of thriller authors a couple of months back and one of them made reference to &quot;the fat chapter&quot;, and the others all went &quot;Ohhhh, yes, the fat chapter!&quot;. Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn&#x27;t fit anywhere else. Every year in games there&#x27;s a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.
This year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread &#x27;em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won&#x27;t be by me. But know that I have my beady little eyes on &#x27;em.

                              <span>Temtem’s inspiration has always been clear. We didn’t beat around the bush when it entered early access back in 2020 - Cian Maher called it the best Pokemon game in years - and I won’t beat around the bush now. It’s still the best Pokemon game in years. It borrows so much from Nintendo&#x27;s behemoth, but it also takes some much-needed lessons that Game Freak fails to recognise, taking the formula to its highest evolution yet.

Some players have been getting themselves very worked up over the inclusion of a paid pass in a full-priced game. Yet there’s been a plan to include a battle pass in Temtem for years. Check out the game’s launch trailer below while you wrap your head around it all.

                              <span>It cannot be a coincidence that 1997 is a pivotal year in the world of Jack Move. In the game, it&#x27;s the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world&#x27;s electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it&#x27;s been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa&#x27;s grip on the city of Midgar. 
But the bigwigs at MonoMind aren&#x27;t out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they&#x27;re more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic &#x27;upload your mind to the metaverse&#x27; kind of tale you&#x27;ll probably recognise if you&#x27;ve read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.

                              <span>I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.
At its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.

                              <span>Every corner of Skyrim houses a locked chest, but where are all the keys? Only a handful actually have keys to open them. So do the chest&#x27;s owners lockpick them every time they want an apple or knife? Are these chests merely decorative, their contents deemed inaccessible and long forgotten? A new mod for Skyrim Special Edition answers this playfully by adding a load of hidden keys to unlock these chests. Some of the keys look quite well hidden in this object hunt, so you&#x27;ll need to poke around, rummage, and turn things over.

                              <span>When we last saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune at the end of A Plague Tale: Innocence back in 2019, things were looking up for the orphaned rat wranglers. They&#x27;d escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo&#x27;s veins.
Alas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo&#x27;s upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters&#x27; worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings&#x27; trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they&#x27;re pointing the finger squarely at Amicia&#x27;s knife, slingshot and crossbow.

                              <span>Explore what&#x27;s behind the mysterious door for yourself
After setting the NieR: Automata fandom ablaze with a mysterious door, modders have made it so you too can venture beyond. The mod behind the NieR church mystery is available to download right now.
Back in July, a strange video caught on in the NieR community. One player said they had found a weird door in the Copied City section of NieR: Automata.
What stemmed from there was a few days of feverish speculation and secret-hunting, up until the folks behind it revealed all. It was not a long-hidden secret or tease for a new Drakengard. It was, actually, a mod.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Hb_Xe1Y4m90
DevolasRevenge and the others behind the project confirmed it was completely in-game, and no editing was used. To show it off, the team confirmed it was going to release it all.
And sure enough, over on NexusMods, you can head over and download the NieR Automata Church right now.
Uploader DevolasRevenge recommends being around level 90 and removing chips like Overclock and Shock Wave. They also recommend the use of the NieR Automata Mod Helper, or NAMH, to install it.
Both NieR and far away
So while there isn&#x27;t some giant secret at the end, it&#x27;s at least an exciting development for NieR modders. The code&#x27;s available to dig around in, and who knows? Maybe this will lead to some really cool stuff in the future. I was already floored by the use of the giant statues near the end of the video, and would love to see more like that made by the community.
Nier fans still have more to look forward to as well. The NieR: Automata anime is in production, and I&#x27;ve got some high hopes for that. And the Switch port of NieR: Automata is right around the corner too.

                              <span>Beating out Blu-ray, CDs, and other platforms
The Entertainment Retailer&#x27;s Association (ERA) has issued statistics charting the UK sales of all &quot;entertainment products&quot; for 2022 so far — and it seems that the British public cannot get enough of Nintendo Switch games, with their physical iteration being the highest-grossing media available on the high street.
Boxed Nintendo Switch titles have raked in a healthy £88.7 million (around $102m USD) in revenue since January 1, 2022, outselling PlayStation&#x27;s PS4 &amp; PS5 releases (£79.6 million) and Xbox One and Series releases (£17.8 million). Away from gaming, Switch titles even outsold other forms of physical media, including music CDs (£68.9 million), DVDs (£66.8 million), and Blu-rays (£52.1 million).

Interestingly, vinyl album sales have skyrocketed, and sit in second place with a hefty revenue count of £79.6 million. This is somewhat understandable, as much of the entertainment scene has made the shift to digital formats, whereas vinyl collectors are highly unlikely to make such a move to the digital sphere. Oh, and also, vinyl albums cost a fucking fortune.
&quot;Vinyl’s rise and rise seems unstoppable,&quot; notes ERA CEO Kim Bayley. &quot;For a 74-year-old analogue format to eclipse the digital-age technology of games platforms is quite extraordinary. 10 years into its long climb back to favour, the vinyl revival is most definitely here to stay.&quot;
Ironically, despite sitting on top of the pile, Nintendo Switch UK sales have actually decreased from last year, with sales down around 12% when compared to the same period in 2021. Of the aforementioned formats, only PlayStation games, Blu-ray, and vinyl saw any growth on the previous year&#x27;s chart.

There&#x27;s nothing better than gaming with a group of friends, but the more people you add to a party, the more chaotic and noisy it can be. Xbox has released a feature to try and mitigate some of the extra sounds in the background, thanks to a feature called party chat noise suppression. It&#x27;s supposed to specifically help remove noises like buttons clicking on a controller and breathing, in addition to other unspecified background noise.
Here&#x27;s hoping it can block out the music my friends bump out loud while playing Call of Duty, but that feels like wishful thinking. This feature is coming exclusively to Xbox Series X/S consoles. Of course, you can also turn off noise suppression in the options menu by going to the guide, selecting Parties &amp; Chats, then selecting Options, and finally untoggling noise suppression.
Xbox also says that while this feature is coming to Series X/S today, it&#x27;ll be rolling out to other devices soon. We&#x27;ll have to see what it turns out like in practice, but if it works well, I&#x27;m hoping PlayStation can get a similar feature soon, as it&#x27;s my console of choice.

In the blog post announcing the noise suppression release, Xbox also highlighted another new feature: a button to jump right into a game from a shared capture on mobile and PC.
Basically what this means is that when you or your friends share screenshots or gameplay clips with each other via link sharing, you will now have the option to launch the game in question at just a click of a button. Thanks to cloud gaming, you&#x27;ll be able to start playing the game right there in your browser as well.
The one caveat is that some games require Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for cloud gaming, but other than that this seems like a convenient addition.

As part of the investor call held yesterday by CD Projekt RED, the studio noted its continuing interest in its high-fantasy franchise The Witcher — Not only did the Polish developer announce that pre-production had already begun, but also suggested that the as-yet-untitled release is expected to kick off an entirely new &quot;saga&quot; set within the sex-and-monster-filled universe.
During the call, CDPR CEO Adam Kiciński was asked to elaborate further on his use of the word &quot;saga&quot; to describe the new title, which is currently in its pre-production stage. Kiciński then explains that CDPR sees the first three Witcher titles, (The Witcher, Assassins of Kings, and Wild Hunt), as presenting a single saga within Geralt&#x27;s world, while the new title will be the first chapter of a whole new arc.
https://youtu.be/YXxF1HfPBoY?t&#x3D;3031
It remains to be seen which lands, heroes, enemies, and narratives are set to make an appearance in the new games, but one can expect CDPR to give it their all with the new release — given the huge interest in The Witcher property following the globally successful Netflix series. In addition, CDPR will likely be looking to repolish its reputation, which took one hell of a ding in the aftermath of the Cyberpunk 2077 launch. CDPR had previously been viewed as something of a &quot;can do no wrong&quot; studio to many — a prestige that the developer will be looking to reclaim.
Of course, we are some years out from our return to the digital iteration of The Continent, so Witcher fans will, unfortunately, have to sit in their local tavern and Gwent it out until Geralt of Rivia (or whomever) is finally ready to draw their swords and venture into the great unknown once more.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is scheduled to launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X in 2022.

                              <span>Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion
A Pokemon distribution is underway in Europe! If you&#x27;re still playing Pokemon Sword and Shield (or have access to it), you can partake.
The Europe Pokemon distribution event: Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion at GAME (UK), Gamemania (Belgium/Netherlands)
Genesect, Marshadow, and Volcanion are all part of the same event, which is going on at the moment in several regions of Europe (listed above) until September 30. According to Pokekalos, it will be an in-store deal, and you&#x27;ll get a receipt with the code for the trio. Again, this distribution is restricted to Pokemon Sword and Shield.
Once you have your code, you have until December 31 to actually put it in using the mystery gift system. There&#x27;s another event possibly on the horizon, too!
Another event is on the books: a shiny Eternatus at GameStop
Details on the shiny Eternatus event are slim, but Pokebeach is reporting that GameStop stores are prepping for a GameStop distribution event (to be announced soon). While GameStop just secures a US drop right now, it could come to other regions.
Yet another event is live now
Also remember there&#x27;s a code live now for Ash&#x27;s Gengar! Oh, and there&#x27;s going to be a Scarlet and Violet bonus distribution when it launches. Nintendo and Game Freak are getting everything out of the way before a new era begins, that&#x27;s for sure.

                              <span>Xbox and Twitch are hosting a new showcase for indies
A new ID@Xbox showcase is on the way. Xbox and Twitch are collaborating to spotlight a heaping helping of indie news on Wednesday, September 14 in the ID@Xbox Fall Showcase.
The event will air on Twitch, both through the /twitchgaming and Xbox channels.
Prior to the showcase, Black Girl Gamers will host a pre-show featuring the upcoming multiplayer deception game Eville. That will start at 9:30 a.m. PT / 12:30 p.m. ET, on the Black Girl Gamers, Twitch Gaming, and Xbox channels.
Then, the main showcase will start at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. Xbox says it&#x27;s expected to run for over 90 minutes, and it will be open to co-streaming.
What&#x27;s new in the world of indies
As for what to expect, ID@Xbox has already announced a few title appearing in the showcase. Metal: Hellsinger and You Suck at Parking will be in attendance, as will gameplay for the upcoming Ghostbuster: Spirits Unleashed.
There&#x27;s also going to be announcements, trailers, deep dives and developer interviews. There will also probably be a fair amount of games announced as coming to Game Pass.
Traditionally, these showcases have spotlighted some pretty cool stuff. The ID@Xbox showcase this last March, for example, had Half Mermaid&#x27;s Immortality, the fun escape room sim Escape Academy, and the powerbomb-RPG WrestleQuest.

It&#x27;s safe to say that something here will probably pop up and surprise someone. If you&#x27;re looking at the fall games lineup and not really seeing anything that strikes your fancy, this might be worth a watch. You never know when a neat indie game might come out of nowhere and surprise you.
The ID@Xbox Fall Showcase airs on September 14, with the pre-show getting underway at 9:30 a.m. PT.

If you&#x27;re remotely interested in the somewhat cryptic nature of Splatoon lore, you&#x27;ll love this new Nintendo developer interview.
In a chat between Hisashi Nogami (producer), Seita Inoue (co-director), Shintaro Sato (co-director), and Toru Minegishi (composer), we get some insight into what plays out offscreen in the Splatoon universe. After a brief overview of what the franchise entails, they&#x27;re off to the races.

A map of the Splatoon world
In what might be the biggest breakout piece of info in the interview, the developers muse on where things are actually located in the Splatoon world — including the new locales in Splatoon 3. The studio created a &quot;tentative document&quot; to fill out the world, and it e…</span>

                              <span>And you can play him even AFTER midnight
Player First Games has released the newest character for its platform brawler MultiVersus, which is currently enjoying a very, very popular open beta on PC and consoles — Climbing out of his ornate box and into your hearts, it&#x27;s Gizmo, the cuddly critter from Joe Dante&#x27;s 1984 classic, Gremlins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SMQetKqvYYU
As we reported yesterday, Gizmo is a support class character, designed to help bolster the abilities of his in-match teammates. Gizmo&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Mogwai&quot; sees our pal warble his cute little ditty, conjuring up music notes that can damage the opposition, while &quot;Gizmo-a-Go-Go&quot; sees the Mogwai cling to his partner, cleansing them of all current debuffs while hanging on for the ride. Of course, it would not be Gizmo without his iconic &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Bow&quot;, an improvised weapon utilized at the climax of movie sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch. The bow can also be charged for flaming Tippex glory.
Gizmo is available to purchase in MultiVersus today, and will be followed by further Season One characters at a later date. These will include Rick of Rick &amp; Morty fame, DC Comics&#x27; anti-hero Black Adam, and Gizmo&#x27;s arch nemesis, Stripe himself. As previously noted, dataminers have also discovered clues pertaining to further, unannounced characters, you can check out these spoilers in our previous article.
MultiVersus is available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Electronic Arts is officially revealing its newest studio. Ridgeline Games is the Seattle-based studio led by Marcus Lehto, and it&#x27;s working on a project set in the Battlefield universe.
Lehto&#x27;s move to Electronic Arts was announced almost a year ago, in October. Today, we have confirmation of both the studio&#x27;s name and its first project. Ridgeline Games is working on a narrative campaign, set in the Battlefield universe.
&quot;It is a great honor to have the opportunity to collaborate with DICE and Ripple Effect and lead the charge on expanding the narrative, storytelling and character development opportunities in the Battlefield series,&quot; said Lehto in a press release.

Independent developer Vodeo Games has revealed that it will be closing its doors in the near future. The sad news was announced on Twitter just yesterday and comes less than a year after the studio&#x27;s debut release, anthropomorphic adventure Beast Breaker.
&quot;The story is unfortunately a familiar one for small studios,&quot; explained the studio. &quot;Despite a year of avid efforts, we&#x27;ve been unable to secure funding for our next project from publishers and investors. As such, we&#x27;ve run out of funds and aren&#x27;t able to keep the team together – and there is simply no Vodeo without our incredible team.&quot;

Splatoon 3 is king this week, as it&#x27;s fully set for a September 9 debut following the Splatfest demo. We have a full review for it, and it&#x27;s arguably the best Splatoon game yet with the key additions of an extra mode (Tableturf Battle) and 24/7 Salmon Run. It&#x27;ll have a nice run as the only major first-party Switch game for a while, until Bayonetta 3 hits on October 28.
There aren&#x27;t a ton of games to really take on Splatoon this week, but Tower Princess and Haiku, the Robot are also arriving on the Nintendo Switch eShop alongside it. Oh, and a handful of other things below!

Overwatch 2 is less than a month out, and today we&#x27;re getting some mixed messaging about how its new heroes will roll out. It looks like Overwatch 2&#x27;s heroes will unlock via the Battle Pass.
The Watchpoint Pack, the paid version of the upcoming free-to-play multiplayer portion of Overwatch 2, includes the first season&#x27;s premium Battle Pass track. And a since-removed portion of that description (via Polygon) notes unlocking heroes via the Battle Pass.
Overwatch commercial leader and Blizzard VP Jon Spector addressed this on Twitter, describing it as &quot;incomplete info posted early&quot; about the Battle Pass. While details will be shared ahead of launch, Spector confirms that new Overwatch 2 heroes will be available on the free track of the Battle Pass.

                              <span>Victory Road (Champion Rank), Herba Mystica (Path of Legends), School Troublemakers (Starfall Street)
Nintendo has finally detailed the three core Pokemon Scarlet and Violet storylines, and they&#x27;ll deal with the following the classic Victory Road &quot;I wanna be the best&quot; journey, as well two other concepts called Path of Legends and Starfall Street. All of this is touched on in a recent trailer, but it&#x27;s really broken down in a really detailed way on the official site.
Here&#x27;s the gist:
&quot;Three stories will be woven into your adventure while traversing the sprawling Paldea region. Along Victory Road, you will go to Gyms in different locations in order to achieve Champion Rank. On the Path of Legends, you can join Arven in search of rare ingredients. And in Starfall Street, you’ll challenge Team Star, a group of delinquents causing trouble for the school.&quot;

So everything is finally coming together. One core feature of this generation was the ability to tackle three storylines in any order, and now we have the full scoop on the themes and characters involved with all of them. Putting in Victory Road and a nemesis plot is a no-brainer and is kind of incorporated into every game anyway: but the third option of finding the Herba Mystica is intriguing (especially with the wrinkle of &quot;Titan Pokemon&quot; playing a part).
On paper, this sounds like a cool idea, especially for folks who only have time to pick the game up for moments at a time. Instead of working toward one lengthy and arduous storyline, they can attempt to finish three smaller ones. Of course, how well scaling mechanics are implemented remains to be seen.

                              <span>Pan nunchaku? Sign us up.
After hitting &quot;a snag&quot; (along with a few more delays) with the release of Dead Cells&#x27; latest free update, Enter the Panchaku, Motion Twin has announced that Switch owners — and other console players — can at last experience this latest batch of new content!
There are a ton of new features in Enter the Panchaku — not just a set of frying pan nunchaku! which launched on Steam back in August. We honestly can&#x27;t quite believe the developer is still putting out big updates like this — years after the game&#x27;s release.

A man has been arrested after attempting to sell Pokémon cards back to the very same trading card store he robbed just one month prior.
On August 9th, 2022, shortly before midnight, a trading card store in Bellingham, Washington, reported that around $20,000 worth of Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering cards had been stolen after the suspect - Myles Vaughn Pajnogac - had entered the premises by smashing through the front door.

One of the best things about the Nintendo Switch is its region-free eShop. That means that you can buy or download games from any region, and play them with no issue on your console. It also means that you can access games that are region-specific, or prices and sales in one region but not another, as long as you know how.
But perhaps you&#x27;ve seen pricing in multiple currencies — dollars, Euro, and pounds, for example — and noticed that the prices don&#x27;t seem to add up at all. It depends on the game and publisher, of course, and some of them are more or less the same across territories. Others, however, can be very different.

Picture the scene: the year is 2020, the land is plagued by a global pandemic (the likes of which we have never seen), and while the world begins to fall to pieces right before your very eyes, you — like many of us — start to become increasingly interested in fishing, real estate, weeding, fossil hunting and, yes, art collection.
Unless you actually had the sudden urge to take up that eclectic mix of hobbies (in which case, boy do we have the game for you), it is most likely that you too were a sucker for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which proved to be a little pocket of comfort while everything else seemed very dark. Now that the world has begun to open up again, our Animal Crossing obsessions feel like a fever dream of an age gone by, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped some fans from living the life that Tom Nook was so keen to sell.

After lots and lots of begging, Persona 5 Royal will, at last, be coming out on the Switch next month. And for those who are looking to download the game on the eShop, we&#x27;ve got a rough idea of just how much space it&#x27;ll take up.
Spotted on the Japanese eShop, Twitter user @ScrambledFaz has shared screens of the game&#x27;s listing, with a 12.5GB file size listed on the page. For comparison, on PS4, Persona 5 Royal&#x27;s download size is 37.76GB.

Above all, a deeper level of customization lets players fine-tune their own wintry apocalypse. PlayStation enthusiasts might recognize the phrase “Play has no limits” from a string of ads. Ragnarök’s lead UX designer, Mila Pavlin, echoed the same sentiments and voiced her dedication to centering players of all walks of life. “This is a fantasy epic,” Pavlin says. “This is about a father and son. This is about fate and the Nine Realms. And the ability to go into that, regardless of your background, and be able to experience all this rich detail and history and story?

Overwatch commercial leader and vice president of Blizzard Jon Spector revealed this on Twitter last night following leaks and rumors that stated the new heroes would need to be unlocked in the battle pass, which is a paid premium pass that rewards players for leveling up through it akin to passes seen in Fortnite and other games. That&#x27;s partly true in that yes, new heroes will need to be unlocked through the battle pass but Spector clarified on Twitter that those heroes will be on the free track of the battle pass.

As you can see, you won&#x27;t need to pay any money to unlock the new heroes in Overwatch 2. However, it could still take some time to unlock these heroes depending on where they are on the free track. Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to find out because Overwatch 2 is out Oct. 4. 
In the meantime, read about how Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Overwatch will come to Xbox Game Pass and then check out why we think Overwatch 2 feels like a completely different game. Read about how cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2 after that.

Now, of course, regulators like the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S.’ FTC must approve of this, and those investigations are ongoing. But suppose all goes according to Microsoft’s plan. In that case, the company will own Activision Blizzard, the publisher and developer behind Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more, by the spring or summer of 2023. 
Shortly after the company announced its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed his company’s intent “to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation” following the purchase. He reaffirmed this commitment earlie…</span>

                              <span>Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. 
GrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. 
OnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. 


Fans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!</span>

Since its debut in 2015, the Splatoon series has delivered unique, colorful gameplay cribbed by scarce launch content and disappointing time restrictions for specific modes. While post-launch content greatly bolstered both games to this point, I’ve always been disappointed by how little was initially on offer. Now on its third entry, the series may feel a bit less fresh, but Splatoon 3 remedies the series’ long-standing launch content woes while retaining all the fun that made the series such a success.

                              <span>Gotham Knights pits a dysfunctional Bat Family against a litany of their greatest foes, but one of the biggest conflicts the group must confront comes from within. How did Warner Bros. Montreal adapt and reimagine these characters to keep them true to their comic origins while still surprising players? A new video breaks down its storytelling process. 
The development team explains the narrative&#x27;s themes of trauma, loss, chosen family, and how it uses the Knights&#x27; long, complicated relationships to make each hero feel fully realized as individuals and as a family. WB Montreal also discusses Alfred&#x27;s pivotal role as a father figure to the team, the social moments that unfold in the Belfrey hideout, and its approach to cinematic design. 


Gotham Knights launches on October 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can see more on the game by checking out the Gamescom trailer spotlighting the villains players will battle.</span>

After releasing a trailer focused on the competitive play of these upcoming pocket monster games, The Pokémon Company is showing off the wonders of the Paldea region and the treasures that await. The video also features a look at some of the rebellious classmates in the game as well as some of its gym leaders.

As you can see, the trailer begins by introducing us to Starfall Street, which is where you&#x27;ll be able to face off against unruly students. Those youths are likely a part of Team Star, the local school troublemakers. This team seems to be categorized by type because as the trailer progresses, we meet Mela, the bos…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation told players in 2020 that it could add 1440p support for game resolution output to PlayStation 5 “if requested enough.” It seems that happened because it’s now available in a new update. 
With the launch of today’s new global PS5 system software update, not only is 1440p resolution available for applicable TVs and monitors, but Gamelists and other anticipated social features are too. There’s also a new audio comparison option to listen to the difference between stereo output and 3D audio in headsets and a new YouTube voice command preview. 
“The update includes several highly-requested features like 1440p HDMI video output and gamelists, as well as social features like the ability to request a Share Screen from a fellow party member, easily view new friends’ profiles, and receive a notification to help you join a friend’s game more quickly from a party chat,” platform experience senior vice president Hideaki Nishino writes in a new PlayStation blog post. “Additionally, you can now compare 3D audio and stereo audio on the same screen and more easily access in-progress Activities from game hubs.” 
For more information about these new features, head to this breakdown here. 
This system software update will allow players in the U.S. and U.K. to preview the ability to search YouTube through voice command. 
“Another feature we’re excited to bring to more PS5 players is the ability to search for content on YouTube through Voice Command (Preview),” the blog reads. “From anywhere on PS5, including during gameplay, you can say ‘Hey PlayStation, find [keyword] on YouTube.’ The YouTube app will open, and relevant search results will be shown.”

                              <span>The Hitman games are often good and usually fun, it’s fair to say, particularly the recent World Of Assassination trilogy. Ian Hitman’s turn in the two films released about his adventures has been rougher to recommend, though. That’s why it’s simultaneously disappointing and awesome to learn that Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and – shudder – Slither director James Gunn narrowly missed his target when he pitched a Hitman movie.

                              <span>Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn&#x27;t make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption 2 now has official FSR 2.0 support, as of the just-released 1.31 update. This makes Rockstar’s cowboy epic/improvised teleconferencing software the latest game to work with AMD’s upscaler without mods; an unofficial FSR patch for RDR2 has been out for a while, but this update should make it even easier to simply enable or disable FSR in the settings menu. Alongside its rival, Nvidia DLSS, which Rockstar also added last year.

The deal will see Tencent bring some of Ubisoft’s most well known game series to mobile, and to PC in China. Tencent’s investment in Guillemot Brothers Limited follows speculation last month that they were looking to take out a bigger stake in Ubisoft, even becoming the single largest shareholders.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an enormous fan of the premise of Steelrising (which is good, because enormous fans are also a weapon in it). In it, we&#x27;re whisked to an alternative history where King Louis XVI stopped the French Revolution before it properly got going by, err, killing everyone with steampunk robots. You&#x27;re Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband&#x27;s new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.
This takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It&#x27;s a bit too easy, in fact.

Corecell came forward last week with the second accusation made by an indie team against PQube in less than a month, following A Space For The Unbound devs Mojiken Studio’s claims in late August. Both studios claim PQube withheld money from them.

Unnamed sources have supposedly told TryHardGuides that three new AC games will be announced during the event, with an instalment set in feudal Japan being among them. Bloomberg backs up the report, stating that the other games purported to be in development include one set in the 16th century that could be dealing with witches, and a mobile game set in China.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It&#x27;s a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. 
Normally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it&#x27;s down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen on this model.

Not until I saw several scrunching up, pretending to be the eyes, nose and mouth of someone’s face in images from upcoming psychological horror card game Out Of Hands. See, Out Of Hands has a slight fixation on the ol’ phalanges. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work.

                              <span>We PC gaming folk have built cities in different time periods and weather conditions, on a vast array of worlds and even in VR. I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th. See the great lumbering beast for yourself by watching the trailer below.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell. Let&#x27;s admire its gleaming reveal trailer below.

                              <span>Playing settlement-building survival game Farthest Frontier has me planning a lot. I&#x27;m planning outposts to mine distant resources. I&#x27;m planning road and neighbourhood layouts to optimise movement and happiness. I&#x27;m planning defences to fend off bandits. But most of my thought is going on farming, planning my crop rotations to optimise fertility and yields. Finally, I have a use for everything school taught me about the three-field system and the nitrogen cycle.

                              <span>The latest playtest build of the next in EA’s Skate series appears to have leaked, continuing the pattern that seems to have been established for the game over the past few months. Footage from the build was shared by Reddit user Parzalai, who said they had been banned from their EA account for leaking a previous build. Modders have been running their own multiplayer servers based on leaked builds of skate. for months, so it’s not surprising to see further leaks spring up from the game’s playtests.

                              <span>The sight of a two-carriage train is normally something that prompts a deep sigh of despair from me in real life. Nine times out of ten, it&#x27;s a sign that something&#x27;s gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone&#x27;s day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. 
In Afterburn&#x27;s adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that&#x27;s about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They&#x27;ve got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they&#x27;re not so complicated that they&#x27;ll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you&#x27;ll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line.

After four packed days of demos, panels, interviews, and lots of fruit smoothies, Liam and I are completely PAXed out, but we&#x27;re not done quite yet.
Below you&#x27;ll find something a little different from our usual daily round-ups. For our last day at PAX, we&#x27;ve done a super, uber, mega round-up on the entire event. We list off our favourite panel moments, the best game demos we played, and our general opinion on how the overall convention went. Click play below to see one of our last videos from the event:

                              <span>If you’ve been looking to give your PlayStation 5 a more rugged makeover (or want to hide it while playing outdoors, somehow), a new set of camouflage accessories is on the way.
This fall, you can outfit your PS5 with gray camouflage plates, a DualSense controller, or Pulse 3D headset. While it&#x27;s as camo as camo can be, eagle-eyed fans can spot tiny PlayStation symbols embedded into the lightest shades of the pattern for a nice touch. 


Pre-orders begin on September 15. The cover plates and DualSense launch globally on October 14. The headset becomes available in December. Sony has not listed prices for these items. 
Maybe one day we&#x27;ll get a camo version of the recently revealed DualSense Edge controller. In related news, Sony recently increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. territories. It also acquired Savage Games Studios as part of its newly formed mobile division.</span>

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has released a (kind of) new trailer for its upcoming anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which it is making with Netflix and Studio Trigger. 
I say it&#x27;s a trailer that&#x27;s kind of new because if you&#x27;ve been keeping up with Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve already seen it. It&#x27;s the NSFW one released last week, but it featured Japanese VO with subtitles. Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now.

As you can see, the English dub sounds great. The studio also announced the series will feature 12 total dubs, including English, Japanese, German, Polish, French, and more. There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too.

                              <span>A powerful sense of discovery drove players to chart courses throughout God of War 2018&#x27;s map. Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise. Ornate chests holding rare equipment and Jötnar Shrines with lore murals were just some of the items awaiting wide-eyed players across six realms. Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials. Despite the size and myriad navigable backdrops, the Norse universe felt …</span>

So as for what to expect, your guess is as good as anyone else&#x27;s. I wager we&#x27;ll be seeing some new Pokémon, perhaps some more information about the legendaries and how they play into the wider narrative of this gen, and maybe a new look at some gym leaders. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long. 
In the meantime, watch the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer for a quick look at this gen&#x27;s competitive play, and then catch up on everything we learned from the recent Pokémon Presents livestream.

                              <span>The Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 is a kind of funny thing, a little plastic box with 15 plastic buttons. Each button has a tiny screen behind it, and when pressed can do any number of things - launching a program, changing to a new scene in a stream, adjusting your media volume, muting a microphone or sending out an alert. It&#x27;s ideal for automation, giving you an easy way to trigger scripts or shortcuts that speed up the dreary parts of your job or your favourite game, and of course for game streamers it&#x27;s invaluable. The MK.2 model normally costs £139, but today at Currys you can pick one up for £97 using the code GAMING30.

                              <span>BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered and BioShock Infinite have all fallen afoul of some questionably titled “quality of life” updates that publishers 2K Games released last week. These updates added a new 2K Launcher to all three BioShocks that appears when booting them up from Steam, but as found by GamingOnLinux, something about this launcher doesn’t take kindly to Linux-based operating systems. Linux-based operating systems like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS.


As it happens, then, there&#x27;s a chance – if you’re trying to play on Valve’s handheld PC – that all these updates will do is swing a bloodied 9-iron into the Deck’s ability to launch the affected games at all. Whoopsie doodle.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software&#x27;s upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won&#x27;t have to wait several months before you can play them altogether.

                              <span>A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games&#x27; Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.


Wildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.

The store page has since been taken down, but not before it was spotted by a few eagle-eyed Twitterers. Seeing as the next Ubisoft Forward showcase is scheduled for this coming Saturday, it’s entirely possible that we’ll be seeing some concrete deets about Heartland then.

They’re appropriately blurry, considering the series&#x27; penchant for mistiness, but still recognisably Silent Hill. Once again, it’s claimed that the game is being developed by Layers Of Fear studio Bloober Team.

After watching yesterday&#x27;s TF2 panel, we were incredibly excited to put our own questions to the TF2 squad. Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.

Local ISPs have been ordered to block 18 pirate sites but the same order also applies to domain registrars, including US-based Namecheap and GoDaddy. These far-reaching measures apply to a movie that hasn&#x27;t yet been released and hasn&#x27;t been pirated either.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the dawn of day three here at  PAX West, and what better way to wake us up than play the incredibly chaotic demo build of
 Friends VS Friends. We loved the trailer from Gamescom and Liam even chose it for his bestest pick in our Gamescom round-up video, so our expectations were high, and after playing a quick match at the Raw Fury booth, Brainwash Gang&#x27;s blood-pumping deck-building FPS shot straight to the top of our favourite things we&#x27;ve seen here at PAX so far.
If you&#x27;ve not heard of Friends VS Friends, check out the game&#x27;s trailer first (its incredibly slick animation is super cool, highly reccomended for your peepers) then watch our interview with Brainwash Gang developer Edu Verz who talked all about the game&#x27;s development.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s PAX West interview is with the one and only Ron Gilbert, series creator of the iconic point-and-click adventure series, Monkey Island. We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.
Gilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island&#x27;s world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game&#x27;s story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won&#x27;t wanna miss that.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz&#x27;s Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.
Neowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn&#x27;t anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game&#x27;s angry robot lads that roamed the city&#x27;s blood-washed cobbled streets.
Overall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware&#x27;s horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!

                              <span>A few weeks ago we posted about a stellar deal on Lenovo&#x27;s BoostStation, an external GPU enclosure that lets you turn almost any Thunderbolt 3 laptop into a gaming powerhouse with the simple addition of a graphics card. Rather than the £200 or £300 prices we normally see attached to these enclosures, this one was available at just £93. Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. 
This time though, you&#x27;ll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again.

                              <span>Seagate&#x27;s IronWolf and IronWolf Pro hard drives are amongst the best available, and now you can get an 8TB IronWolf model for £150 at Amazon, a historic low price. 
This is a huge amount of storage, ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video, and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison, the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669, making this more than four times cheaper.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a busy day at PAX West, but nothing has been as wild as the Gearbox Software panel. Randy Pitchford made a return to the Seattle stage to let us know what&#x27;s coming up for Gearbox, but not without some shenanigans first.
After a classic Randy magic trick, a proud display of lock-down Lego builds, and a chaotic bidding war where he auctioned off the literal shirt off his back (which an audience member bought for an eye-watering $1200) we finally got to see some fresh New Tales From The Borderlands gameplay and had a lovely chat with director of production, James Lopez. Watch the video below for the interview in its entirety - it&#x27;s a good&#x27;un!

                              <span>Publisher 2K teased back in April that it was bringing back Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands series but that this time, it would be developed in-house by Gearbox Software. Then, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event, Gearbox officially revealed the sequel, which is less a direct continuation of Telltale’s story and more a spiritual successor to the series, which is evident in its official name: New Tales from the Borderlands. 
That new trailer gave us a look at the new protagonists – altruistic scientist Anu, her street-wise brother Octavio, and local business owner Fran – as well as a look at just how Tales from the Borderlands this new entry is this time around. Sure, it’s a new cast and an all-new story in the world of Borderlands, but it’s clear it will play and feel familiar…</span>

                              <span>Fans of Splitgate, the sci-fi multiplayer shooter with portals, received some bittersweet news today. Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.
1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren&#x27;t any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. 
As such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. 
You can read 1047&#x27;s full statement below (click to enlarge):
Splitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year&#x27;s show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won&#x27;t see them during DC&#x27;s big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR&#x27;s version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be &quot;about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077.&quot;
Choooom! There&#x27;s something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below:

                              <span>At Gamescom I sat down with a lovely ice cold beer and two lovely lads who ran me through military real-time tactics sequel Men Of War II in a 45-minute hands-off presentation. As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game&#x27;s early missions, I can genuinely say that I&#x27;d be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I&#x27;d genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

                              <span>Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don&#x27;t want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey &quot;retro&quot; would completely misrepresent it. It&#x27;s beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It&#x27;s translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It&#x27;s a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It&#x27;s vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I&#x27;m so glad I got to play it.

                              <span>Real-time tactics game Men Of War 2 has been pushed to 2023 to incorporate more features and content sparked by feedback from closed playtests. Developers Best Way and publishers Fulqrum say the impact of having to pause development because of the outbreak of war in Best Way’s home country of Ukraine has led them to take extra time on the game for these to be implemented. Watch the latest trailer below.

The cheeky scamps at poncle have only gone and made me look like a right sausage today, surprise announcing another patch. This time, they’re adding in a new game mode, quick start, and a very odd new character.

                              <span>Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

                              <span>Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

                              <span>First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

                              <span>After teasing a reveal for Warner Bros’ licensed brawler MultiVersus earlier this week, devs Player First Games have revealed that Gizmo from kids horror film Gremlins will be the game’s next fighter. Gizmo is the original source of the gremlins, and the sweetest character from the movies, but you still wouldn’t want to mess with the little fellow. He’ll arrive on Tuesday, ahead of the already announced Stripe, Gremlins&#x27; big (small) bad.

                              <span>Many archival and emulation projects are underway to preserve the wonderful history of Flash games, and best of all are those which try to recreate the original experience: just clicking a link then playing a game inside your browser. Now one unofficial Flash Player emulator is adding support for more classic games, ones made in the (relatively) newfangled ActionScript 3 language. So you can party like it&#x27;s 2008 by heading over to Newgrounds and playing You Have To Burn The Rope again, as well as Wonderputt and a handful of others.

                              <span>Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

The game’s campaign network co-op, season 3 of multiplayer, and Forge mode have been pushed back, and couch co-op outright cancelled. And if there’s one thing about Halo that you don’t mess with then it would seem that’s couch co-op.

All we know for sure so far is that the game exists, it’s definitely called Mirage, and returns to the Middle Eastern setting of the original Assassin’s Creed. I rather like the blue highlights to the assassin’s robes in this one.

                              <span>As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don&#x27;t have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

                              <span>Cloudflare suggests that it made a mistake by terminating the accounts of The Daily Stormer and 8Chan. These decisions made it harder for the company to defend itself against overbroad termination requests and invited a wave of follow-up demends, from activists to copyright holders. This isn&#x27;t a position Cloudflare wants to be in.

                              <span>The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has added the scalps of more pirate streaming sites to its growing collection. Earlier distress signals suggested that HDFilme and xCine might be in trouble, but their domains diverting to ACE leaves no doubt. Importantly, both sites were operated from Vietnam, an increasingly big player in global piracy that has the MPA worried.

As well as the Yeti and Snowball USB microphones that are most likely to be familiar to you, there&#x27;s also a rare 42% discount on the Blue Blackout Spark XLR mic - nice. 
However, the microphones I&#x27;d like to focus on today are those popular options, specifically the Blue Snowball Ice and the Blue Yeti X. These represent the top and the bottom of the Blue spectrum when it comes to gaming-friendly USB mics.

                              <span>The second-best way to make Twitter palatable (after simply unfollowing sources of bad tweets) is to follow a load of curated and bot accounts which trickle niceness into your timeline. Today I&#x27;d like to suggest adding Skybox Satellite, a Twitter account which shows glimpses of the skies wrapped around maps in GoldSrc games like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. It&#x27;s sometimes pretty, sometimes nostalgic, and sometimes impressive.

                              <span>Back at Geoff Fest, I spoke with Glenn Schofield about The Callisto Protocol, its gore system, spiky walls, and batteries. From what I&#x27;d seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that&#x27;s not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.
So, at this year&#x27;s Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James about what I&#x27;d seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

                              <span>Last week HyperX announced their first-ever gaming monitors, the Armada 25 and Armada 27, and within a couple of days I was being led into their Gamescom booth to try each of them for myself. After a disappointingly uncomfortable preview of the Samsung Odyssey Ark, it was nice to get to grips with a far more utilitarian pair of monitors – albeit not without a party trick of their own, namely HyperX’s Armada Gaming Mount.

Wowzer! Thanks for being with us for this record-breaking feat. We asked for suggestions and received many excellent ones, but in the end we went with a suggestion from Jonathon which, at the time we recorded, I did not realise would be instantly revealed by the episode title.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began the preliminary stage of their investigation at the beginning of July, with a deadline set for September 1st. That initial stage of investigation found that the deal could “substantially lessen competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services”.

                              <span>After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real and we&#x27;ll be learning more about it next week.
That&#x27;s because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we&#x27;ll learn more about the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed and more. It seems Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it&#x27;s possible we learn more about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft&#x27;s in-development Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, too. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game.

September 1, 2022
If rumors and leaks about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are correct, we&#x27;re in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he&#x27;s not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin&#x27;s order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed and new Assassin&#x27;s Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they&#x27;re downright exhausting. An Assassin&#x27;s Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin&#x27;s Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

                              <span>In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it&#x27;s anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won&#x27;t be until 2024 at the earliest.

Later in that same year, the studio revealed Deathpool, a second original character that imagined what a child of Deadpool and Death would look and act like.

                              <span>After growing in early access for two years, Ooblets finally sprouts in its 1.0 form today. The cheerful game blends monster collecting (the Ooblets), farming simulation, and light town management as you restore a wacky village to its former glory. Though an overall laid-back experience, there’s a lot of spinning plates involved, and it can take time to figure out how to maximize each day to keep your farm brimming with valuable crops, your roster full of different Ooblets, and your wallet stretched with Gummies (the game’s currency). That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

                              <span>Endnight Games&#x27; The Forest became one of my favorite co-op experiences almost two years after its launch. And when more Sons of the Forest footage was revealed the following year (2021), my excitement level reached an all-time high. Sadly, the sequel has been delayed again, but the devs seem confident in the horror survival game&#x27;s early 2023 release period.  
Hey Everyone,

Endnight Games&#x27; post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team&#x27;s hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio&#x27;s most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it. 
Sons of the Forest splatters onto our screens next year, February 23, for PC.</span>

                              <span>In this segment of New Gameplay Today, your host, Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc, walks you through how Saturnalia works as both a survival horror game and a roguelike. In it, you&#x27;ll see him control Anita, one of the game&#x27;s many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it&#x27;s not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It&#x27;s due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.</span>

Either way, it packs many enhancements over the base game. While I didn&#x27;t care much for Part I, if you&#x27;re interested in checking it out yourself, here are some of the biggest changes you can expect. 
Accessibility Options
The Last of Us Part I comes with Naughty Dog&#x27;s full suite of accessibility options. And that&#x27;s something worth commending. This comes in the shape of fully customizable controls, a host of visual aids, options to alleviate motion sickness, help with navigating levels, options for the deaf or hard-of-hearing, and combat accessibility. Within each are dozens of sliders and toggleable options, allowing players to customize the game experience completely, …</span>

                              <span>I remember the release of The Last of Us better than any other video game – which is to say I remember it at all. 
In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could&#x27;ve hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s The Road, No Country F…</span>

Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

This news comes from a posting released by NetEase today that calls Quantic Dream its first studio in Europe. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost NetEase, but the developer-publisher says it will allow the studio to continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing games while supporting third-party developed titles too.

The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.
“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

                              <span>I’m exhaustively (re-)watching all Star Trek ever, including the undeservedly neglected early-1970s animated series, and (obviously) the films. What would make it even better would be finding the time and tuits to enhance the experience with ambient lighting for my TV. Not the expensive off-the-shelf kind; the kind you make yourself at a fraction of […]

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is set to conclude the Norse era of the series, a saga that’s seen Kratos atone for his troubling past by becoming a more conscientious god and (mildly) affectionate father. In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  
I spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you’ll learn about Kratos’ tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available …</span>

                              <span>Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What&#x27;s more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It&#x27;ll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


&quot;When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight&#x27;s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist.&quot;
&quot;Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure.&quot; 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

But I can tell you that Sonic Frontiers is the first entry in the series I’ve been looking forward to since the Dreamcast.  
For reference, the last time I was excited to play a 3D Sonic game, it was attached to the Dreamcast kiosk at my local target. And to be fair, the orca jumping over the racetrack in the Sonic Adventure demo was a great reason to bug my mom for a new Sega console.

                              <span>Various Hollywood studios and Netflix are continue their crusade against pirate sites Down Under. The companies have asked Australia&#x27;s Federal Court for a new court order requiring local Internet providers to block dozens of websites. In addition, several of the blocking orders already in play were extended recently.

                              <span>Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you&#x27;ll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they&#x27;d expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.</span>

                              <span>Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we&#x27;re happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

                              <span>Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years.

I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …</span>

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
