Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was one of the many highlights at the recent Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase. And ahead of its release later this year, Nintendo has announced a free trial for the first game exclusive to Switch Online subscribers.
At the moment, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is only available as a free trial to subscribers located in Europe, Australia and New Zealand at the moment, but if this follows the pattern of a lot of other trials, it should be made available elsewhere in time.

Throughout the lifespan of the Nintendo Switch, there have been a number of &quot;impossible&quot; ports released. We&#x27;re talking games like The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt and the new version of DOOM, developed by specialist teams such as Saber Interactive and Panic Button.
One other developer who is also known to work miracles on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system is Virtuos. Since the arrival of the Switch, it&#x27;s helped bring games like Dying Light, L.A. Noire, Dark Souls: Remastered and Bioshock: The Collection to the device. Now, in the latest news, it&#x27;s been revealed the same company is behind the NieR:Automata Switch release (originally developed by PlatinumGames).

In case you missed it, Sol Cresta actually got a release on Switch earlier this year (after starting out life as an April Fool&#x27;s joke). Since then, PlatinumGames has been issuing updates for this new shoot &#x27;em up, and we&#x27;re now up to the next major one (Version 1.0.4).
The Japanese publisher and developer has shared the full patch note details on its official website, with the promise the team will &quot;continue to make improvements and further updates&quot; in the future. This latest update makes some changes and adjustments, and also fixes a couple of issues:

I trawled through archives of official sites hoping to discover that the marketing department had released it as a wallpaper or something, to no avail. But I did find a load of other official Deus Ex wallpapers which are so delightfully turn-of-the-millenium. Scanlines! Lensflare! Photoshop Difference Clouds filters! Come, admire, enjoy.

The Worthy Of Better, Stronger Together bundle is organised by streamer and musician Abbey ‘Scruncho’ Smith of horror game publisher Dread XP, and features 169 games. Picking up the bundle aids the National Organization For Women and the Center For Reproductive Rights in equal measure.

I can confirm it&#x27;s really good! A lovely point and click mystery with some tricksy puzzles, but unlimited goes so you still get to feel clever - plus the story plays with some mystery tropes in really fun ways. But the real joy is its characters. It&#x27;s a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.

The images shared by RealiityUK are still up on ResetEra if you want to have a nosy.

Sega’s decision comes in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of the Roe v. Wade ruling last month, which had enshrined abortion rights at a federal level for almost half a century.

SGDQ, or Summer Games Done Quick, is a speedrunning charity fundraising marathon that wrapped up last weekend with a total of over $3 million raised for Doctors Without Borders. It included a run of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl, a tense relay race in Super Mario Maker 2, and an absolutely nuts 30-minute run of Elden Ring as the finale.
But every year, there&#x27;s always one run that rises above the rest — and, admittedly, it&#x27;s usually a Zelda game, for whatever reason. This year, it was Ocarina of Time... or, it was sort of Ocarina of Time. Let us explain.

It’s 1 AM and you have just spent the past 12 hours replaying the same segment of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In your mind, there is no stopping until perfection is achieved – or the more likely option – you pass out from sleep deprivation. For the next few weeks, you continue to hone your skills, in the hope of reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a full run of the game. Meanwhile, you are in a race with a massive community of like-minded individuals, each with their own strategies and goals in mind. Welcome to the world of speedrunning.
Since its release in 2017, Breath of the Wild has been featured in several speedrun categories, with the most popular being Any%, where players attempt to defeat the final boss and complete the game as quickly as possible. Despite the longevity of the main adventure during a casual playthrough, BOTW can now be beaten in less than 30 minutes, with the world record currently sitting at 24:10 by a runner named Koroks. To understand the work that goes into running this huge game, we spoke with Koroks about that astonishing world record run, and life as a speedrunner.

It&#x27;s happening, alright. Polium, a Web 3 company (Web 3 is an idea of a new version of the internet that we know today, with a form distributed in the blockchain) has revealed the very first NFT video game console this weekend.
Called the Polium One, this little black box is meant to be &quot;a multi-chain console for Web 3 gaming&quot; and will have both existing and exclusive games on the system when it launches sometime in 2024. And while the console has drawn some criticism online, some of you eagle-eyed Twitter users have spotted some similarities between Polium&#x27;s logo and a certain Nintendo console&#x27;s own.

PowerA is joining in with the pink puffball&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebrations in its own way! The accessory manufacturer has created a brand new wired controller to celebrate Kirby&#x27;s birthday.
Everything about the controller is peak Kirby; pink buttons, splashes of different shades of pink and blue, a little warp star in the middle — what more could you want? Mappable buttons? 10ft cable? All of the other tricks that a PowerA controller has? It&#x27;s all there in perfect blue and pink form.

Splatoon 3 is looking to close out Nintendo&#x27;s summer offerings with a paint-splattering bang, and Nintendo UK has shown off another stage coming to the third paint-blasting multiplayer game.
Called the &#x27;Mincemeat Metalworks&#x27; (yep, reread it), we hope the stage isn&#x27;t as brutal and gory as it sounds! Luckily it isn&#x27;t dealing in squids or meat of any kind, but it used to be a Metalworks that created more scrap metal. It seems like the new stages in Splatoon 3 are following a bit of a pattern, with the last one — Undertow Spillway — also being a little bit grey and metallic.

Since the commencement of Russia&#x27;s invasion into its neighbouring country of Ukraine back on February 24th, Nintendo has gradually halted operations within the country. Roughly one week after the invasion started, it was reported that eShop payments had been suspended within the region, with Nintendo later confirming that it had halted exports of products to the country.
During the Q&amp;A session for the 82nd Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at Nintendo, an attendee asked two of Nintendo&#x27;s directors (Shutaro Furukawa and Shatoru Shibata) about their thoughts on the prospect of further business within Russia. While Furukawa and Shibata understandably refrained from sharing specific details, they confirmed that halting operations within the region had a &quot;negligible effect&quot; on Nintendo&#x27;s overall financial results:

                              <span>You&#x27;d be a mug to ignore it.
There’s a section near the end of one of the new stages in Cuphead’s DLC that made us shout a four-letter word at the screen extremely loudly, and that word wasn’t ‘cups’. Being the level-headed types we are, it’s very rare for a game to make us resort to such outbursts, but there we were, bellowing the sort of language that would turn the air bluer than Mugman’s nose. And yet, despite this, we weren’t gnawing our fists in rage or spiking the controller off the wall. We were laughing.
We can’t go into much more detail because it’s the sort of thing you should discover for yourself, but it’s the sort of cheap trick that will likely guarantee you’ll die the first time, which in any other case would be thoroughly infuriating given how many lives will likely be lost to reach that point. And yet, something about Cuphead makes its cheeky trick endearing rather than enraging.

                              <span>Right down to fourteenth.
Although it&#x27;s only been out for little over a week, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has fallen from the top spot all the way down to fourteenth place in the UK charts, below the likes of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and Mario Strikers: Battle League Football. It&#x27;s perhaps the biggest drop we&#x27;ve seen in quite some time, though it&#x27;s unknown at this time exactly how much sales have fallen.
As expected, F1 22 has reached number one for the UK, with Formula One racing games historically performing well in the region. Elsewhere, it seems to be business as usual, though something interesting (and depressing) to note is that FIFA 22 sold the best on Nintendo Switch, accounting for 33% of total sales. The game was recently included on PlayStation Plus and also forms part of Xbox&#x27;s Game Pass Ultimate line-up with EA Play, which may contribute to the game&#x27;s sales success on Switch.

Last year, First 4 Figures revealed the latest product in its line of Metroid-related items: Samus&#x27; Helmet. It&#x27;s basically a scale model of the helmet Samus Aran wears in the Metroid Prime series, with one unfortunate omission – you can&#x27;t actually wear it. Tsk.
Like so many hardcore Metroid fans, we naturally ordered one regardless, and it&#x27;s now sitting on a table in the Nintendo Life office while we try to decide exactly where to put it. You see, this thing is seriously heavy and comes in a box that you could easily hide a small child in.

Monster Hunter Rise has proven to be a welcome continuation of the IP&#x27;s global growth in popularity, following the breakout mainstream success of 2018&#x27;s Monster Hunter: World and its Iceborne expansion on non-Nintendo platforms. Rise itself brought some interesting evolutions from World, retaining more of the quirky charm we loved in previous generations on platforms like 3DS, Wii and Wii U, while shaking up the formula for the better (well, in this writer&#x27;s opinion, anyway). It delivered load-free open zones, faster traversal and verticality, and new mechanics to give combat a fast-paced, stylish feel.
It was relatively easy, though, by Monster Hunter standards. Not only did Capcom do some welcome streamlining of the &#x27;grind&#x27;, but a lot of encounters barring a small number of exceptions were more manageable and less terrifying than perhaps expected. This was partly due to new movement and mechanics improving our abilities, but we can also be guilty of forgetting that Rise was the &#x27;base&#x27; game.

Man, Pokémon types... If you&#x27;re super into the Pokémon franchise, you&#x27;ll know that a strong knowledge of the various types can often mean the difference between failure and success within both the campaign and online community. Of course, there are many other variables that ought to be considered when jumping into the world of competitive battling, but we won&#x27;t go into that here... Just give us a flute and a sleeping Snorlax and we&#x27;re happy.
Fans have been debating which Pokémon type is generally considered to be the best for years at this point. With the introduction of type combinations and relatively new types like &#x27;Fairy&#x27;, deciding which type comes out on top is frankly a near-impossible task.

October is looking like a pretty stacked month for Switch owners if last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini is anything to go by. During the Partner Showcase, we got a confirmed release date for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and confirmation that PlayStation 4 classic NieR: Automata would be getting a port called NieR: Automata The End of YoRHa Edition.
Launching on 20th October and 6th October respectively, these dates might seem quite far away, but the Fall season of games will soon be upon us. And we know already roughly how much space both of these releases will take up.

Bandai Namco had some new details to share at Anime Expo 2022 this weekend on the upcoming Pac-Man World: Re-PAC, a remake of the PlayStation platformer. And this new version of the classic 3D platformer had a few bells and whistles added that&#x27;ll make the game feel that much smoother.
This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen the remake in action since its reveal at last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, and it&#x27;s looking really good. The stream shows off some of the abilities that Pac-Man will have in Re-PAC including a hover-jump and butt-bounce abilities. One new ability is that Pac-Man can transform into Mega-Pac, which is a cool little reference to the yellow puck&#x27;s original appearance.

                              <span>When discussing the founding of Starward Industries, game director Marek Markuszewski brings up all the points you might expect from a new team. The company wanted to gather a group of experienced but still-passionate developers, all focused on the idea of creating something ambitious despite the studio’s smaller size. The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.
Admittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem. In it, the crew of the Invincible spacecraft investigates the planet Regis III for its mis…</span>

Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review.

I fell hopelessly in love with Metal Max Xeno Reborn. It was my first time with the series, which has been running in Japan since 1991. It was quite the roller coaster for me. I immediately jumped online and placed an order for some of the series’ early games. I felt the heartbreak of Metal Max: Wild West getting canceled. Then I found love again in Metal Max for the Famicom. Then I reminded myself that Metal Max: Wild West was canceled, and now I’m sad again.
Metal Max has largely stayed in Japan, outside of Xeno and its Reborn cousin. We got Metal Saga on PS2, but that went by without much notice.

I když zbytek světa má okurkovou sezónu, v technice se stále něco děje a jako vždy pro vás máme připravenou spoustu novinek a zajímavých témat. Ptáte se, co konkrétně? Určitě si něco povíme o chystaném Raspberry Pi Pico W s přidanou Wi-Fi. Ze světa hardwaru nesmí chybět ani šílenosti jako 100n kondenzátory pro použití do 30 GHz nebo 10n do 110 GHz a kde je koupit. Ze světa obskurit třeba novou edici 25 let starých grafických karet Voodoo 5 6000 nebo “kutilský life hack”, který jenom v USA už stál nejméně 34 životů.

Pokud by Vám nestačila tato témata, bude samozřejmě probíhat po celou dobu volná diskuze v klasickém punkově-chaotickém stylu, který je nám vlastní a díky kterému není VB suchopárná konference, ale pravá hospodská diskuze, kde může proletět i virtuální půllitr.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 4. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

Why haven&#x27;t there been more games like Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy?
We have a particular soft spot for music and rhythm games, and even more so music and rhythm games that put their own twist on the usual beat matching. Theatrhythm is just one of those games.

There are a lot of video games out there in the world. Shooters, platformers, narrative adventures, fighting games — iconic genres that have almost forty years of precedence to make them what they are today. Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there&#x27;s anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design. The industry has plenty of answers for keeping things moving forward, but my absolute favorite trend in games right now is genre mashup.
That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s as simple as taking two game genres and combining them…</span>

When I was growing up, the sounds of sports were always all over our house. My dad likes pretty much every sport imaginable, from football to baseball to track and field. A lot of the time I had no idea what was going on, but having a game on in the background made for the perfect backing track to take my Sunday afternoon naps. Sometimes when I want to feel extra cozy, I&#x27;ll find an old NFL game on YouTube to put on while I fall asleep.
These days, the closest thing I get to watching sports is esports. It&#x27;s an entirely different world, as I&#x27;ve learned from my friends who work on that side of the industry, but there&#x27;s also a lot of crossover there.
For one thing, esports took a lot from traditional sports when it comes to the way they set up thei…</span>

There may have been way too many people trying to get into this year&#x27;s Anime Expo in Los Angeles this year, but I can sympathize with them. After all, two straight years of online-only events has a lot of us jonesing to get back out there and be around those who share our interest in Japanese entertainment. Not only is the expo the place to see all the upcoming toys you&#x27;ll be buying and shows you&#x27;ll be watching, but it&#x27;s also a great source of game announcements. Case in point: Aksys Games and its Anime Expo reveals.
The specialty publisher announced seven games it&#x27;s localizing in the west in 2023. Most of the games will release exclusively for Nintendo Switch, but a few will also make appearances on other hardware.

It&#x27;s fair to say that The Lord of the Rings (and by extension, The Legendarium, a catch-all term that covers J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth works) is a huge part of my life. I&#x27;m writing this now listening to the soundtrack of the Peter Jackson trilogy, after having come back from a four-player session of The Lord of the Rings LCG co-op card game. Oh, and I went to a Tolkien-related academic conference this past weekend: Mythmoot 2022.
It was there that I caught up with Dr. Corey Olsen, The Tolkien Professor (more on that peculiar emphasis in a moment) to talk about his involvement with the Return to Moria game, as well as some thoughts on the upcoming Gollum project.
For hardcore Tolkien fans, Dr. Olsen needs no introduction. Bu…</span>

Well howdy there, buckeroos, welcome to the weekend, and Whatcha Been Playing? For our American readers, (which analytics tells me is about 90% of you), I believe that it is a holiday weekend. Independence Day, no less. I hope that you have a very happy weekend and that you&#x27;re able to find some time for good food, good gaming, and good friends. If you&#x27;re working, that&#x27;s unfortunate, but I hope your shift goes smoothly, and that you can treat yourself once you get back home. You&#x27;ve all earned a break, so be kind to yourself, however you see fit.
And, if you aren&#x27;t feeling particularly patriotic, well, I get it. I don&#x27;t see myself saluting the flag of any country ever again, quite frankly. But you are not your leaders nor their choices. I sure as hell am not m…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I&#x27;d prefer to ignore brandter, in which corporate Twitter accounts pretend to be people with terrible senses of humour.

Still on its Namco kick, the retro fun factory that is Hamster Corporation is offering up something a little special for this week&#x27;s release, as the under-the-radar but surprisingly groundbreaking Thunder Ceptor is available to download right now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released to the arcade market in the summer of 1986, Thunder Ceptor is an into-the-screen rail shooter with shmup elements and a hyper-futuristic aesthetic. Developed and released by Namco as something as an answer to smash hit Space Harrier, the game features the fast-paced, into-the-screen shmup action as the Sega classic, complete with dazzling colors and incredibly fast-paced galactic gameplay. Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber SidRetron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Iv4nRyFUNJA
At the time, Thunder Ceptor was by far Namco&#x27;s most technically advanced and resource-heavy release yet, and is also the first-ever video game to feature a 360-degree yoke controller. Like Space Harrier, Namco&#x27;s offering also boasted an impressive sit-in arcade cabinet. Not content with this all this extravagance, Namco would offer up revamp-cum-sequel 3D Thunder Ceptor II later that same year, which added stereoscopic 3D visuals to allow for further immersion and/or headaches.
Surprisingly, however, Thunder Ceptor has not seen the same level of celebration as many of Namco&#x27;s other releases, having been frequently left off of multiple retro compilations, leaving the 3D shmup to fall between the cracks of the company&#x27;s long-term history. While not as slick or as polished as its inspiration, the pretender still brought a few cool tricks to the arcade dance hall, and its resurrection through the Arcade Archives range has been a long time coming.
Thunder Ceptor is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.

                              <span>Patch 8 looms on the horizon
Larian Studios has another update on the way for its ongoing early access RPG Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. A new Panel From Hell is on the way, unveiling the also-incoming Patch 8 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.
The next Panel From Hell, Larian&#x27;s regular showcase for new Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 content, will air on July 7 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. You can follow the countdown and site here, or keep an eye on Larian&#x27;s Twitch channel. The company rented out a theatre in Ghent for the occasion, so expect at least a little bit of pageantry.

Panels From Hell usually coincide with new patches for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and this one seems no different. Larian posted a PSA today for the upcoming Patch 8, confirming that this update will indeed render old saves incompatible. The team is keeping beta branches up so players can keep running their old files if they&#x27;d like, though with this new update, Larian will only keep the two most recent patches active. This means Patch 6 and 7, alongside the incoming Patch 8. You can find easy-to-follow instructions on opting into beta branches here.
A hefty update
Previous patches have added everything from new story content and areas to explore to new classes, though there&#x27;s not much of a hint what&#x27;ll happen in Patch 8.
What we do know is that it will be a fairly hefty update, file size-wise. Larian&#x27;s post says this update will be roughly 40 GB, bringing the total file size of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 up to 104 GB of storage space.
Whatever is on the way, I&#x27;m down for more. Larian has been up-front in saying that 2023 is its target for leaving Early Access, and I&#x27;m eager to see what it&#x27;s building up to for the full game.

                              <span>The team started building Fire Emblem Warriors 2, then pivoted
According to a new interview via Nintendo Dream magazine (translated by Nintendo Everything), the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes team had a different idea in mind for the follow-up to the original.
This notion is straight from the production team (including producers Yosuke Hayashi and Hideo Suzuki), who stated that they had helped work on Three Houses with Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, right after Fire Emblem Warriors development ended. After that lengthy and fruitful partnership between the three entities, they proposed a direct sequel for FE Warriors.
Hayashi recalls that it was originally titled &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors 2,&quot; but everything pivoted when the concept of slotting the game into the Three Houses universe came to light. The decision was a no-brainer because of the &quot;good reception and the setting,&quot; which made it an obvious choice for a sequel. The collective says it was &quot;what the audience would want the most,&quot; and I think they nailed it!
Suzuki also muses a bit on how it all came to pass, and the decision to downplay other parts of Fire Emblem history was made to focus entirely on Three Houses:
&quot;It ended up as the phantom proposal (laughs). The direction may have changed, but we’re fans of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, so we were more glad than anything to have the opportunity to create a Warriors title in that setting.&quot;

To put it bluntly: good! The first Fire Emblem Warriors didn&#x27;t really have the same oomph, as it attempted to juggle a lot. The storyline wasn&#x27;t nearly as cohesive as it could have been, and the idea to tackle a parallel universe with Three Hopes was a smart plan. It helps differentiate the original Switch strategy game completely, while providing a new take on the world.

Whenever Nintendo hosts a new Direct, mini or otherwise, one of the first things I do when it&#x27;s done is pop over to the company&#x27;s Japanese YouTube channel to see if there were any game reveals that didn&#x27;t make the cut for North American and European audiences. While trailers exclusive to the Japanese streams are usually for incredibly niche titles, more often than not these streams will feature a game or two with a far broader appeal that audiences on this side of the ocean wouldn&#x27;t mind getting their hands on. During the last Nintendo Direct, we reported the Japanese version featured a new kaiju-filled entry in the Monster Rancher series. It was one of the more interesting games announced that day, and thankfully, Bandai Namco confirmed at Anime Expo that it is localizing t…</span>

                              <span>NieR: Automata Switch is 720p in portable mode
We have confirmation of NieR: Automata Switch specs and things are looking good!
Announced very plainly on Twitter thanks to the NieR Japan account, Square Enix states that the resolution for docked/TV mode is 1920x1080p, with concessions for 1280x720p in tabletop/portable mode. They also clearly state the framerate: 30FPS. Well, that&#x27;s pretty cut and dried!
This is important to note, as the account is tweeting out new details in regards to the Switch port of the game, following the reveal in the Nintendo Direct Mini. Some folks were noting that the Square Enix site stated a &quot;60 FPS&quot; framerate, but that figure seems to be copied and pasted from the Yorha Edition specs on other platforms. We&#x27;ve reached out for clarification on the matter, but until then we&#x27;re confident that 30 FPS is the target for Switch.
As a reminder, NieR Automata is out on October 6 on the Switch platform. Thankfully, it will not be a cloud-based nonsense release! Take that Kingdom Hearts. While the jury is out on how stable the game actually is in the end, it looks like Square Enix is perfectly capable of putting out non-cloud ports. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Switch and not an outlier.

Hey there! I was going to be playing MADiSON today, a brand new horror game akin to Visage, as I heard it was released last weekend. Turns out it&#x27;s been pushed til next weekend (hopefully) so today I’m pivoting to... Dark Souls II. I&#x27;ve always said I put it on pause for a rainy day, and today is that day, both metaphorically and literally.

The controls were the hardest part last time I played a few years ago, but I was also a noob. I’m definitely a pro and definitely ready for this now. See you tonight!

It has taken a while for Nintendo Switch Online to get here with its small-batch, subscription-based rollout, but the Sega Genesis lineup is starting to come into its own. Whereas the N64 additions for Switch Online + Expansion Pack have been solo drops, Sega fans get a few Genesis games at a time, and this week&#x27;s lineup is surprisingly good.
As of June 30, Expansion Pack subscribers can play Comix Zone, Mega Man: The Wily Wars, Target Earth, and Zero Wing on Nintendo Switch. So what&#x27;ll it be? Pain or pleasure?

So I missed the Sonic 2 angry Tails movie poster, and I especially missed that the Japanese version had a more lighthearted happier one. While these types of changes are fairly common, it doesn&#x27;t make it any less funny. Over on Twitter, user whisperwolf brought it to my attention, spotting the differences that I&#x27;m sure a lot of folks had already seen.
Then the comparisons started coming in, calling it a &quot;Kirby moment,&quot; a classic example of a character that gets more lighthearted or serious depending on the region:

Another person reminds us of another Sonic 2 angry Tails makeover. The Ristar animation changes, which took the Ristar &quot;serious&quot; boss battle face and plastered it across the entire US version:

For this particular case, Japan got it right. Tails, by nature, is a free spirit. You can see this trait in pretty much everything he&#x27;s in, from Sonic 2 to the Sonic Boom TV show. Every so often Tails can get down to it and save the day (especially when he needs to step up after a Sonic absence), but his kind heart is what sets him apart from the otherwise stoic and wisecracking cast of friends.
Bet you didn&#x27;t expect a Tails character breakdown this weekend eh? Well, as I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere, it&#x27;s been kind of a rocky week, and my kid and I have been watching a lot of Sonic Boom together!

                              <span>Disco Elysium&#x27;s newest update makes the game more accessible
Disco Elysium is one of my favorite games of all time. I love recommending it to anyone who will listen, but something I forget is just how text-heavy that game is. I&#x27;m an avid reader, but for others, the game&#x27;s script, which clocks in at over a million words, can be pretty intimidating. The good news is, though, that the developers at ZA/UM are well aware of this fact, and have made a bunch of great changes since the game has come out to help make the game accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. Disco Elysium: The Final Cut introduced a fully-voiced experience, but the newest addition is yesterday&#x27;s free update that added dyslexia-friendly fonts.
The font used for most languages is called OpenDyslexic, which was designed to mitigate common reading mistakes that those with dyslexia can make. The great thing is that the font&#x27;s creators made it open source, so that anyone can use it if needed.
In Disco Elysium specifically, OpenDyslexic is used for the English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese-Brazilian, and Polish versions of the game. Other languages have also been accounted for — the Korean version uses a font called Nanum Square Round, while the Russian version uses Adys.
ZA/UM also stated that they&#x27;re still investigating options for both traditional and simplified Chinese.

The devs shared their thoughts in Steam blog post that announced the update: &quot;It’s important, especially for a game with over a million words, that we continue to make improvements to ensure everyone can have the best user experience during their time in Revachol.&quot;
It&#x27;s great to see yet another studio taking down as many barriers to entry as they can -- it feels like the games space is only becoming a more thoughtful and considerate space (for the most part).
The dyslexia-friendly font update is available to download now, wherever you can play Disco Elysium.

Think of a game in which you control a character (so no Tetris or anything) — go ahead, any game! Now, chances are, whichever game you&#x27;ve picked, its protagonist is either young or, at the most, middle-aged. You&#x27;ve got the likes of Link, Mario, Samus, Cloud, Joker, Neku, Scott Pilgrim... We could go on, but you get the idea.
It&#x27;s a shame that senior characters (which we&#x27;ll loosely define here as a person who&#x27;s around retirement age or older) aren&#x27;t represented more in gaming; after all, Nintendo&#x27;s remarkable ability to create games suitable for all ages means that people like Audie (A.K.A the &#x27;Animal Crossing Grandma&#x27;) enjoy gaming into their 90s and beyond.

The group demands at least hundreds of pounds from internet users for downloading a single movie but according to The Gazette, the partnership could be just weeks away from being forcibly dissolved. The number of businesses that face disruption is rather large, to say the least.

                              <span>A tip: If you’re playing Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, stick with the “classic” mode, whatever happens. C’mon. Despite its musou trappings, Three Hopes is still a Fire Emblem game, with all the life-or-death stakes and high-minded strategizing that entails.

If you wanted a quick recap of the Nintendo Direct Mini announcements, we already gave you one! But life is often a visual medium, and we have the solution right here.
Bam!
https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1542870646945976321
To recap, here are a few choice Nintendo Direct Mini announcements:
Persona games coming to Switch
A NieR: Automata port that isn&#x27;t cloud nonsense
The Mega Man Battle Network series lives on again in 2023
In all, it was a pretty fun little Nintendo Direct Mini. A little stressful, I might add, because it all dropped at once with a giant VOD, but once we all got through it together and figured out what was actually new, it was fine. In fact, it was straight-up better and more justified in its existence than a lot of other &quot;Summer of Gaming&quot; streams. Leave it to Nintendo to just casually drive through without a big first-party stream even and crush some of the competition.
I have to admit though, the way Microsoft dropped that conference on us this summer and said &quot;everything announced here is coming out within a year&quot; was pretty baller. A select few of these Switch announcements are likely a ways out, and the &quot;to be released in the future&quot; notations for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are worrying in particular!

                              <span>Nothing Sly going on here
Today, Sucker Punch Productions published a message about its 25 years of games. In the process, it also confirms that no, it&#x27;s not working on a new inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper game.
Sucker Punch says in its message that as its games continue to grow, they require the full attention of the studio. And being that it&#x27;s currently focusing on one project, the studio says it&#x27;s not working on any other one of its properties.
&quot;As our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require the full attention of our studio. With our focus on our current project, we have no plans to revisit inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper right now, and no other studio is currently working on projects related to those franchises either. These characters are very special and near and dear to our hearts, so while we’d never say never to re-opening those doors down the road, for now there are no inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper games in development.&quot;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MlNfJvFnzc8
An inFAMOUS legacy
That pretty much settles that. Sucker Punch does go on to confirm its performing maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC servers, to keep them running a bit longer. They will eventually be sunset, but Sucker Punch says it wants to keep them running &quot;for as long as possible&quot; for players who still want to dip in. The Cole&#x27;s Legacy DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son will also be put up on the PlayStation Store in all territories soon.
It&#x27;s a bit of a strange announcement, though there have been rumors in the past of a return to Sly Cooper revival and the like. This just seems like Sucker Punch getting out ahead of that, as it works on something it says is unrelated to inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper. Sorry to all the fans of thieving animals.

The Blizzard of today is insanely different from the Blizzard of 11 years ago, and this old video of the Blizzard DOTA concept shared on the Heroes of the Storm reddit from the Arkentass YouTube channel proves it.
Embedded below, you can watch footage from BlizzCon 2011, where the team showcased a build of Blizzard DOTA: the MOBA that would eventually be released as Heroes of the Storm four years later. Keep in mind this was back in 2011, when the MOBA genre was still very fresh and League of Legends had barely been out (it was just two years old and Riot wasn&#x27;t quite the empire it is now); and there was some actual MOBA competition going on. By the time Blizzard actually shipped what became Heroes of the Storm out of t…</span>

                              <span>New Wing prepares to take Flight. Airplanes.
Long-time publisher Bandai Namco has announced that it has partnered with Japanese studio Ilca to form a brand new development division, monikered Bandai Namco Aces.
&quot;With the recent remarkable growth of the global game market, the demand for more high-end games is increasing,&quot; wrote Bandai Namco Aces on its new website. &quot;On this basis, in order to deliver high-end games that exceed the expectations of fans around the world, we have decided to establish a new company to strengthen our capacities to develop games with hyper-photorealistic expression.&quot;
&quot;Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. has cultivated its expertise in game production through its production of the Tekken series and the Ace Combat series. Ilca has the technical capabilities to produce high-quality content using state-of-the-art technology. Going forward, while leveraging the strengths and know-how of both companies, we will continue to deliver high-quality contents that can be played in-depth and for a long time to fans around the world.&quot;
The Ilca team will lead development in the new division, assisted by its new vice president, Kazutoki Kono. Kono is a veteran producer and director of the popular flight adventure series Ace Combat. And given the &quot;Aces&quot; branding of Bandai Namco&#x27;s new division, one would assume that it is set to be preliminarily focused on the dogfighting series, which is now in its 27th year.
The most recent title in the series, Ace Combat 7, came out in 2019 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. The acclaimed release recently received new content in the form of a Top Gun: Maverick DLC drop.

                              <span>It kicks off on July 11
The Pokemon Sword and Shield wild area is getting a change-up in a little over a week, as The Pokemon Company has announced a new event is on the horizon.
Starting on July 11 at 8:59 JST, Poliwag, Marill, and Spheal will appear in greater number, particularly when it comes to the Wild Area nests: including shiny encounters. The Pokemon Company says it&#x27;s a way to enjoy the &quot;hot summer.&quot; As a note, a lot of folks have been hunting for that shiny Marill, and the green-colored creature is fully confirmed to appear at a 2% rate in five-star raids.
As a reminder, the Sword and Shield Wild Area is periodically changed to suit different events and rotates around a selection of Pokemon. For getting a full &#x27;Dex, it was a really fun experience to dive in and check out different weather patterns and locales for creatures — and helped extend my playthrough of the pair of games quite a bit.
It&#x27;s interesting, because the Sword and Shield Wild Area both feels malleable and static at the same time. If Scarlet and Violet (and future games, really) want to go the route of &quot;everything is the wild area&quot; in the future, it opens up a bit more — but the team likely isn&#x27;t going to completely rework the entire game for little micro-events like this.
While the Wild Area was an experiment of sorts, it ended up becoming one of my favorite elements of any modern Pokemon game.

Fans are flying through Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, and I don&#x27;t blame them — it&#x27;s been a long time coming, and the new bosses are an audio-visual treat, as expected. The urge to burn through the gauntlet and circle back around to improve the grades is high.
That said, it pays to take it slow and appreciate the finer details. One of them, a secret alternate boss phase in the Cuphead DLC, is low-key blowing my mind for a few reasons.
First off, it&#x27;s been a while; I forgot that alternate boss patterns were even on the menu for Cuphead. Naturally, Studio MDHR would carry it forward for The Delicious Last Course, right?

                              <span>It&#x27;s based on the Dissidia Final Fantasy NT model
A Kingdom Hearts Cloud mod that brings the KH aesthetic into Final Fantasy VII Remake is something I always needed — and only just got. I mean, it only makes sense with Nomura connected to both!
Crafted by ColossalCake (great name, I could use a colossal cake this weekend) and housed on NexusMods, the Kingdom Hearts Cloud mod is simple and breezy, and swaps the core character model of Cloud for the one featured in Kingdom Hearts. That includes his memorable little infernal wing and red scarf, as well as the extremely Nomura-heavy bandaged sword. As the creator puts it:
&quot;Cloud as redesigned in Kingdom Hearts. I chose to remove his cape however, as there wasn&#x27;t any clean way for it to be supported by the armature. His sword is also mostly the original FFVII:R mesh, with the bandages adapted on top.&quot;

Apparently most of the texture legwork was done by Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, with adjustments done by the modder. At this point, the Final Fantasy VII Remake modding scene has multiple pipelines and paths to success, with mesh importers and modding tools available to help ease the process. It&#x27;s great! You love to see modding communities come together.

After several years, Crypt of the Necrodancer is getting a big update. Brace Yourself Games published the v3.0.0 update for Crypt of the Necrodancer yesterday, June 30.
The studio also shared a blog post about the update, going into more detail about what it adds and why. As it notes, it has been 1,721 days since Crypt of the Necrodancer&#x27;s last update in 2017. As for why the update is happening? I&#x27;ll let Brace Yourself speak for itself:
&quot;Well, let’s just say this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there.&quot;

That&#x27;s certainly good news. But as for the biggest feedback, this update addresses a bunch of quality-of-life a…</span>

A few days ago, our own Noelle Warner shared a piece that rejoiced in her newfound obsession with video game genre mash-ups. While experimenting with genre combinations has long been a celebrated tradition of this industry, there is something about the mashups we’ve seen in recent years that sets them apart from those that emerged in the infancy and adolescence of this medium. Neon White is easily the current poster child for the practice, but past titles like Crypt of the NecroDancer, Battle Chef Brigade, and Yoku’s Island Express show what’s possible when you really think outside the box.
Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is yet another wild combination of two genres, taking age-old shoot ‘em up gameplay and pairing it with the currently popular escape room na…</span>

                              <span>New free playable characters, stages, and relics
Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon refuses to die. The humble puzzle Shovel Knight spin-off is already packed with playable characters and other ways to change up the experience, but the unrelenting teams at Vine and Yacht Club Games won&#x27;t be satisfied until everyone on Earth understands that this game is a blast, and the only way to do that is to coax the global population into trying it. And what better way to do that than with free DLC?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ujvmJ5fA6l8
Starting today on Steam (and coming soon to consoles), the Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon Puzzler&#x27;s Pack DLC is open for business, offering up new playable characters like Mona the alchemist and Puzzle Knight the nogoodnik.
Mona can chain potion explosions for massive combos, and the Puzzle Knight can turn enemies around clockwise to change their overall effect on the battlefield. These unique strategy options are compounded by two new relics, two areas to explore, and new challenges. And this Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon DLC is just the start. Mod support — and the option to refract and enhance your character&#x27;s abilities — are all coming soon.
The team at Yacht Club truly wants Pocket Dungeon to be a game of the people. That&#x27;s why they are opening their discord channel to all comers to discuss what they do and don&#x27;t want in the game. The plan is to keep updating this Puzzle Pack for as long as possible. Remember folks, the original Shovel Knight received massive free updates over the course of five years, so who knows how far they&#x27;ll go. If you want to learn more about them and why they are so unrelentingly giving, check out the 8,000-plus-word interview I did with them in Lock-On 004. As Hot Rod once said, &quot;It&#x27;s a whopper alright!&quot;

                              <span>The New Genesis PlayStation port arrives on August 31, 2022
After over a year with Xbox console exclusivity under its belt, we&#x27;re getting a Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis PlayStation port.
Announced this morning, Sega intends to bring the game to PlayStation 4 on August 31, 2022, which will bring it in line with the PC and Xbox editions of the game. This will include all prior content updates of course, including the recent Kvaris region expansion. Previously the game (which is a more action-oriented spinoff that takes place 1000 years after the PSO 2 proper narrative) launched on June 9, 2021 after a lot of fanfare from Microsoft, but the console exclusivity period is done.
The publisher also confirmed today that it will hold a Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis event at Anime Expo that will honor the whole PSO2 subseries. Here&#x27;s the info:
&quot;In honor of the upcoming launch, SEGA has commissioned one-of-a-kind art that will be displayed all weekend at Anime Expo 2022 in Los Angeles. The gallery will also feature concept art, figurines, and additional artwork commemorating PSO2&#x27;s recent milestones. There will also be a SEGA photo booth that will transport Anime Expo attendees into the world of PSO2:NGS! Booth visitors will also receive codes to redeem in-game items like ARKS Expo shirts, a mag form, an emote, and a sticker. A limited selection of PSO2: NGS merchandise, including shirts and pins, will be available for purchase; these items are exclusive to Anime Expo and ARKS Expo in Japan.&quot;

Sega provided us with a tease of the Anime Expo New Genesis PlayStation concept art, which you can view in the gallery below!

                              <span>This feels like a marketing move from 2010
Remember roughly 10 years ago, when companies were trying to brainwash people into hating single-player games? It was kind of an awful time for gaming, full of &quot;Project 10 Dollar&quot; chicanery (when publishers would put $10 passes in their games to launch content, to avoid used game sales), copious on-disc DLC, and forced multiplayer that sometimes shut down mere months after launch. Well, this EA single-player games tweet brings me back to all that:
https://twitter.com/EA/status/1542652454159798272
Bad idea to tweet this in 2022, right? Not to mention the entire vibe of the tweet (which is taken from a TikTok trend) feels like a joke from a decade ago? So like, I kinda get someone making the call (whether it was higher up or not) to make an out-of-touch tweet like that: at another studio, if that. But EA literally has had a bad history with dunking on single-player games, and is actively making some now, like the Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. This was exacerbated by Vince Zampella (who helps run the studio that makes the Fallen Order series) tweeting out a &quot;man facepalming&quot; emoji in direct response.
Things got a lot tenser, too, as Zach Mumbach, a former EA/Visceral Games employee (the studio of Dead Space fame, among many other games like Dante&#x27;s Inferno), stated that &quot;this is the company that shut down my studio and laid off ~100 great developers because we were making a single-player game.&quot; They were likely referring to Visceral&#x27;s Star Wars game. Someone else tweeted out a list of games and IP that went to EA to essentially die.
Eventually, EA admitted defeat:
https://twitter.com/EA/status/1542706383694565378
But the damage was already done. Users reminisced about the publisher&#x27;s various deeds, and former and current employees mused on how volatile it can be to work for EA. It just goes to show you: not every meme trend is worth chasing, especially if you&#x27;re a brand.

                              <span>A nice place to visit, but you wouldn&#x27;t wanna die there
Bethesda Softworks, in association with developer Arkane Studios, has dropped a fresh trailer for its upcoming co-op shooter Redfall, which remains currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.
The video focuses on both the titular monster-ridden city, as well as the posse of protagonists bringing their superheroic ways to the blood-soaked streets — aiming to clean the city of vampires, zombies, and other unholy creatures of the undead. In the preview, we meet inventor Remi De La Rosa, hunter extraordinaire Devinder Crousley, the trigger-happy Jacob Boyer, and the telepath Layla Ellison, all of whom sound as if they were named by NXT development.

Blending seamless single and multiplayer options, Redfall will allow players to choose and customize their character as best fits the battle, making adjustments for loadouts, skills, and special abilities. By forming strong, synergized builds with your fellow teammates, the four heroes will offer a threat to the huge number of bad beasties that wait within the parks, buildings, restaurants, and tourist traps of this once quaint community.
With large open-world areas, a dazzling array of makeshift weaponry, and oodles of style and charisma, Redfall hopes to capture the co-op horror market on release, offering an alternate to some of the team-shooter titles currently available in the genre. While the development team was unfortunately forced to delay the title to allow for extra polish to the &quot;ambitious&quot; release, Redfall is now expected to launch in early 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X.

This Zelda: Breath of the Wild horse video helped patch up what has ostensibly been a rough week for me, in true Breath of the Wild fashion.
Shared by u_guessed on Reddit, the clip takes a quick and hilarious turn after Link attempts to call back his horse on a riverbank. He whistles...and...nope! The horse immediately turns around, and starts swimming away. Cold as ice.
It&#x27;s a fine line, this sort of stuff, but Zelda: Breath of the Wild generally makes things easy to come back from. In other open-world games, the &quot;emergent&quot; gameplay can often lead to game-breaking bugs or frustration. And Breath of the Wild has some of that, to be sure!
But I encountered my fair share of good quirks like this, enough to even help carry multiple playthroughs. If my horse did this in-game, I&#x27;d have to put the controller down to have a good laugh. It&#x27;s just perfect: the speed and cadence in which it peaces out.
I know five years on, folks are a little tired of Breath of the Wild still being in the zeitgeist, but I know a lot of people still get a kick out of it, or even still play it! I salute you all.

                              <span>With millions of dollars at stake, the legal battle over the Pulp Fiction &quot;NFT&quot; copyrights is heating up. Quentin Tarantino recently asked the court to dismiss the case because he still owns the rights to the screenplay. However, Miramax now argues that the movie director&#x27;s &#x27;limited rights&#x27; only apply to print publications and not NFTs.

Two leaders of the network received 44-month prison sentences and the other five were ordered to serve between 9 to 18 months. After the defendants gave up around one million euros of the amount they generated from the fraud, a court suspended their custodial sentences.

                              <span>Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?
Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!

                              <span>Microsoft, the company that brought us furry Sonic controllers and a Far Cry 6 console that resembled a bomb, has unveiled its latest kooky Xbox Series X sweepstakes, and it may be the coolest/dumbest one yet.
Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It&#x27;s hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.</span>

The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

Most Linux distributions like Fedora end up installing this entire set of Linux firmware files that can easily be 200~300MB even though most systems only use a few select files. With Fedora 37 later this year they are hoping to better deal with the situation by splitting up of linux-firmware and only installing sets of firmware packages depending upon the actual hardware in use...</span>

                              <span>The Tour De France, the grandest race in professional cycling, started today. Across three weeks, 176 cyclists will ride 3328 kilometres (2068 miles) winding through France, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland, including the Alps and Pyrenees. As a keen cyclist and avid Tour watcher myself, I&#x27;m excited. So in celebration, over the coming weeks I&#x27;ll be gabbing about the Tour De France, cycling, and bikes in a wide variety of video games with my own Tour De Jeux, from big-budget open-world extravaganzas to cute wee indie adventures. Let&#x27;s start in the obvious place: the official Tour De France video game.

I&#x27;ve nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

                              <span>I’m contractually obligated to inform you of the best early Prime Day deals on PC gaming hardware, even though Prime Day 2022 isn’t until July 12th. Aaaaand then continues over until June 13th. Jeff, lad, that’s two Prime Days. Regardless, Amazon’s Prime Day landing page is already a gateway into some decent discounts on peripherals, SSDs, gaming monitors and the like, so take a look if you’re of a more urgent mind. Unlike the bulk of actual Prime Day deals, the ones you’ll find listed here don’t even need an Amazon Prime account to access.
Previous Prime Days have driven competing retailers to knock down some of their own prices, and this year looks to be no different, so I’ve included some good sales from non-Amazon retailers as well. For the 12th and 13th we’ll also post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide (like last year&#x27;s), so you can still make some savings even if you’re avoiding Amazon specifically.

                              <span>The arrival of Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion has brought a swathe of quality of life improvements to Capcom&#x27;s beast-bashing action game, including support for Nvidia&#x27;s performance-boosting DLSS tech. Announced earlier this week as part of the game&#x27;s 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone&#x27;s hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that&#x27;s not exactly ideal.

Little Kitty Big City will see you wearing the whiskers of a cat less concerned with going home than it is with wreaking urban havoc. But what if you don&#x27;t want to wait for these games? Well, you have options. Here are 10 of the best cats in PC games.

In addition to, or perhaps instead of, anime openers, I put it to you that more games should celebrate their launch days with live action music videos - and after watching Capcom&#x27;s freshly unveiled &quot;Matsuken Sunbreak&quot; vid for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, I think you&#x27;ll heartily agree.

                              <span>PAX East 2022 may have taken place all the way back in April, but we still have a few bits and pieces left to talk about from our time in Boston. Namely: the 12 indie games included as part of the event&#x27;s PAX Rising Showcase, a booth that&#x27;s been a fixture of PAX for over a decade that allows developers to show off their upcoming projects to those attending the show.

And it works because it is deliberately valueless.

A free update yesterday added the option to display text in fonts which are intended to be easier to read for some people with dyslexia. The popular OpenDyslexic typeface is used for many languages, while Russian and Korean have their own fonts. I have a touch of the ol&#x27; dyslexia myself and do find this font helps me a bit.

                              <span>Adapting an established property in any medium has got to be a pretty tricky proposition. Satisfying the long term fans while keeping things approachable for newcomers on top of, well, making a good game. Add in the complexities of making a turn-based game based on an existing turn-based game and it’s surprising that developers don’t just collapse into gibbering, tentacle-waving Chaos Spawn.


Complex Games, the developers of recent XCOM-like Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters not only managed to resist the mutating power of the Warp, but produced an absolute cracker of a game. Suspecting pacts with Dark Powers were behind it, I put on my big Inquisitorial hat and set off to question Noah Decter-Jackson, the game’s Creative Director.

The first full expansion since Cottage Living launched a year ago, High School Years is set to do exactly what it says on the tin, massively expanding gameplay options for Sims in their teens.
The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there&#x27;s a fair bit of overlap with the series&#x27; established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that&#x27;s been on the fandom&#x27;s collective wish list for a very long time.

                              <span>Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment&#x27;s newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I&#x27;m hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game&#x27;s first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack&#x27;s thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don&#x27;t have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a &quot;punker granny&quot; or a &quot;famous streamer&quot; with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it&#x27;s difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.</span>

                              <span>As previously promised, Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op takes its first steps towards launch, thanks to a network beta flight scheduled for July.  
Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version. 
In a Halo Waypoint blog post, 343 lead software engineer Isaac Bender and lead world designer John Mulkey discussed the co-op mode’s feat…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ll soon have the chance to play EA&#x27;s highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this &quot;insider&quot; program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title &quot;Still working on it.&quot; The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series&#x27; skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it&#x27;s going to be a blast.</span>

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…</span>

                              <span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is getting an expansion called Trials of the Dragon King. The DLC includes new gear, jobs, and enemies to fight. Check out the short trailer below; it&#x27;s as deliciously chaotic as you&#x27;d expect. 
There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it&#x27;s hard to parse through what&#x27;s happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, &quot;You will die here, and I will live forever.&quot; We&#x27;re sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, &quot;Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that&#x27;s a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it&#x27;s all about combat and little else.&quot;
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup of free games has arrived and it’s quite a good one, featuring Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, and Arcadegeddon. 
All three of these games will be available to download for free for all three tiers of subscribers to the newly revamped PlayStation Plus – Premium, Extra, and Essential. You can add each to your library starting July 5 and they’ll be available until Aug. 1. That means you have until July 4 (next Monday) to download last month’s free games: God of War (2018), Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl. You can read more about the June 2022 PlayStation Plus lineup here. 
Enough about June, though – it’s old news! Onto July 2022! Here’s what PlayStation has to say about each of this month’s free games: 
Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)
Arcadegeddon (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
While waiting for these games to go live, be sure to download last month’s games – God of War, Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl – and then read about the revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service to find out which new tier is right for you.

                              <span>Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title&#x27;s latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn&#x27;t have the power of Roadhog&#x27;s but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we&#x27;re also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You&#x27;ll just have to watch for yourself to find out!</span>

                              <span>Over the many years of covering Coreboot (going back to when it was called LinuxBIOS!) on Phoronix the selection of supported motherboards has been rather unfortunate especially over the last decade. If wanting to run Coreboot on a system today it basically means running a Google Chromebook, using an outdated server motherboard or old Lenovo ThinkPad that has seen a Coreboot port, or out of reach to most individuals are various server motherboards that are reference platforms or board designs from hyperscalers. But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their &quot;Dasharo&quot; downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard. I&#x27;ve been trying this out and it has worked out surprisingly well. Here are my experiences and benchmarks of Coreboot/Dasharo on this Intel Alder Lake motherboard.</span>

                              <span>Let’s face facts: the old Sonic games have been re-released more times than I’ve had hot dinners. And every single Sonic fan has bought every single one of them, such is our sheer madness. We’re a little spoiled on PC for Sonic content these days, with every recent game of note having its own PC port that’s immediately been modded from bottom to breakfast. But it wasn’t always this simple, oh no. It used to be pretty slim pickings for us Sonicsters, and I’m here to tell you what we fought through to get to the promised land of ports we bask in today.

Dubbed &#x27;W3itch.io&#x27;, the copycat site&#x27;s creator replied to a tweet from Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran, who promptly asked them not to &quot;rip off&quot; Itch.io anymore. W3itch.io even described itself as a “free-as-freedom open marketplace for independent game creators inspired by Itch and Gitcoin”. Not the most sensible of ideas to engage with the person whose work you’re replicating, W3itch.io.

Hailing from designer Terry Cavanagh, the DLC gives each of the base game’s six contestants an episode with “wildly new designs and rules”, the devs say. Play through all the episodes and you should get another 4 to 5 hours out of the game.

                              <span>A few years back, Pip enjoyed Hook, a minimalist puzzle game about untangling mish-mashes of hooks and pins by removing pieces in the correct order. If you try to remove that one, the hook will snag on that pin, so first this pin needs to go but ah! that goes through the middle of this ring, so... it&#x27;s interesting to understand a shape and system so you can pull it to pieces. Now a sequel is out, and it&#x27;s also nice, and it&#x27;s under £2, and it has a demo too.

                              <span>Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

                              <span>Against all possible odds, we&#x27;re officially halfway through 2022. What a year it&#x27;s been so far! After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I&#x27;ve started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I&#x27;ve played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you&#x27;ll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it&#x27;s done ours. I&#x27;ll warn you now, though. It&#x27;s a big list.

                              <span>Video game parodies are often ropey, being neither funny nor fun to play. I am delighted that The Looker is both, and free too. It&#x27;s a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it&#x27;s only an hour or two to complete.

                              <span>Classically animated platformer Cuphead will finally get its Delicious Last Course with the release of the expansion on Steam today. The DLC adds a new character, Ms. Chalice, the third beverage-container bonce you can play as. Once you’ve unlocked her in the DLC you’ll be able to play as her in the base game too. There&#x27;s also a new island with mountains, icy tundra and desert to navigate. Watch the trailer below, although it’s getting on a bit now.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t until I played a hands-on preview of Cult Of The Lamb this weekend that I realised how much ovine imagery is knocking around Christianity. All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

                              <span>Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there&#x27;s no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve&#x27;s added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

                              <span>Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&amp;2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn&#x27;t going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, &quot;How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Yes, please. I&#x27;d very much like that. Give it to me now.&quot; Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You&#x27;ll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you&#x27;ll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We&#x27;re not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it&#x27;s slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.</span>

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game&#x27;s associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle&#x27;s success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike. 
&quot;We were particularly happy by the fact that we saw many players who were not too used to the tacti…</span>

                              <span>Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game&#x27;s narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what&#x27;s to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean&#x27;s characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond&#x27;s campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

More specifically, Fallen Angel will hit Switch on July 19, meaning there’s already less than a month left until you can take the archangel experience with you on the go. If you aren’t familiar with Fallen Angel, you can get a look at what awaits you in it in the special Switch announcement trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there are a lot of hellacious things going on, which makes sense considering you control Lucifer as he attempts to ascend from hell to get revenge on those who banished him from heaven.

                              <span>Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. 
This shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. 
“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” 
This news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
According to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.

                              <span>With Atari&#x27;s 50th anniversary happening this week, the company has revealed Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we&#x27;ve seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry. I went hands-on with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration to see how well it accomplishes that lofty goal.
At its core, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration delivers more than 90 playable games in one $40 package. Players can expect classic and retro titles from six hardware platforms (Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, ST, Jaguar, and Lynx), all with emulation created by renowned re…</span>

                              <span>You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions &amp; Legends. 
Azra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:
“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”
Azra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions &amp; Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions &amp; Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions &amp; Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” 
Civilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. 
As Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”</span>

Honestly, I went into my hands-on slot expecting to plaster a big &quot;meh&quot; on the game in my notepad. But the inclusion of a &quot;modern&quot; control scheme flipped this on its head. I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s an absolute game changer.

Developers Rogue Factor didn&#x27;t provide many other details, besides a few buzz words: &quot;semi-open world&quot;, &quot;true adventure&quot;, &quot;third person&quot;.
So, I sat down with the game&#x27;s creative director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête in the hopes he could shed some light on the aforementioned vibes, perhaps even turning them from ethereal gusts of Annihilation-ness to concrete info on just how the game aims to be a &quot;true adventure&quot;. Lo and behold, I think it worked!

                              <span>Fntastic, the studio developing Steam’s most wishlisted game The Day Before, have issued a statement to RPS explaining their policy of using paid and unpaid volunteers to make up their dev team. Metaphorical alarm bells began ringing earlier this week when it emerged that Fntastic are composed entirely of “volunteers” – although full-time volunteers, kindly dubbed &quot;employees&quot; in the statement, do receive salaries.

                              <span>I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around.

You may remember him from such roles as future emperor of the universe Paul Atriedes in David Lynch’s Dune, cafficionado Special Agent Dale Cooper in David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, and for his turn in David Lynch&#x27;s Oscar-nominated Blue Velvet. Please tell me David Lynch will at least direct the pilot.

Give me Pugwall, give me Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, give me Loud. Announced yesterday, the rhythm game will tell the tale of teen girl who goes from playing air guitar on a broom to wailing on the world stage. Loud looks cute, somewhere between Life Is Strange and Guitar Hero, and you can see a bit in the trailer below.

                              <span>Tým tvořící editor videa Pitivi vydal novou verzi 2022.06. Ta přináší novinky vzešlé z GSoC projektů Pitivi. Mění ale také výchozí nastavení pro časovou osu, kde nové výchozí nastavení používá levý klik pro výběr a přetahování klipů, pravé kliknutí pak pro posuv či scrubbing. Kdo používá jednotlačítkovou myš, může předchozí chování nastavit v nastavení.</span>

Hlavní novinkou je podpora nové verze skriptovacího jazyka Vim9 Script, který má zásadně zlepšit výkon editoru. Je to zajištěno kompilací skriptů do instrukcí, které mohou být prováděny velmi rychle. Výsledkem by mělo být desetinásobné až stonásobné zrychlení.</span>

                              <span>The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.</span>

                              <span>Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he&#x27;s unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham&#x27;s thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He&#x27;s also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.</span>

                              <span>Over the last 31 years, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan base has dashed through several distinct eras. The Classic Era let fans platform through brilliantly designed 2D stages, while the Modern Era gave us the Adventure games and Boost games, and that&#x27;s not even counting the Sonic Boom titles. Now, with the movies setting box office records and reinserting everyone&#x27;s favorite blue hedgehog back into the mainstream consciousness, a new era for Sonic the Hedgehog games could very well be upon us. With Sonic Frontiers, Sega and Sonic Team could hope to welcome fans to the Open-Zone Era of the franchise.
For this issue&#x27;s cover story, I traveled to Burbank, California to Sonic Team&#x27;s U.S. headquarters to play hours of Sonic Frontiers. I spent that time exploring Kronos Island, fighting enemies, solv…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers&#x27; exploration-heavy gameplay. 
As seen during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears. You can obtain these gears by solving puzzles and comp…</span>

Persona 5 Royal, the 2020 upgraded version of the 2017 base game, comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 21. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are also coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, though they&#x27;ll do so later. 
Only Persona 5 Strikers, the spin-off/follow-up to Persona 5, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, a fighting-game follow-up to Persona 4, have appeared on Switch platforms. For our review of Persona 5 Royal, head here. To learn more about Persona 5 Strikers, head here.</span>

While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed that we&#x27;ll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.
Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has pulled back the curtains on Dragon Quest Treasures, a new spin-off entry in the legendary Dragon Quest franchise that was first teased in May 2021. This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you&#x27;re exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild&#x27;s paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it&#x27;s worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level. 
Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Live A Live is just over three weeks from release, but Nintendo and Square Enix are ready to rev the hype engine. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.
The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it&#x27;s always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.
Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.</span>

The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft&#x27;s stable. Announced during Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve heard anything about that game. That changed today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which shined the spotlight on the company&#x27;s third-party partners.
Otherworldly enemies have suddenly appeared, trying to take the energy possessed by Sparks, who appear to be Rabbid versions of the Lumas from Super Mario G…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world&#x27;s final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier&#x27;s classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>When the first Mega Man Legacy Collection launched in 2015, players hoped there was more to follow. Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it&#x27;s been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I&#x27;m hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>One of the most requested titles is finally coming to Switch later this year. Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don&#x27;t know much else about what appears to be an &quot;ultimate&quot; or &quot;game of the year&quot; edition of the title, but the game&#x27;s inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition arrives on Nintendo Switch on October 6. For one Game Informer&#x27;s opinion on why you need to play Nier: Automata in some form, head here.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn&#x27;t stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn&#x27;t ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.</span>

                              <span>Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

                              <span>Hearthstone is taking a trip to the Shadowlands for a fancy dinner party hosted by the definitely-not-nefarious Sire Denathrius. &quot;Hosted&quot; is appropriate in the past tense because someone has murdered the now-former leader of Revendreth and the Venthyr. Now there&#x27;s a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.


Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent&#x27;s deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…</span>

                              <span>Adata&#x27;s Premium SSD for PS5 might be the most misleadingly titled storage device on the market. Okay, it is a high-spec SSD suitable for the PS5, but it&#x27;s also a really good value PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs too. Today, it&#x27;s down to $185 at Adata&#x27;s official Ebay store when you use the code FREEDOM15 - an unbelievable price for the level of performance on offer. 
That&#x27;s some $145 below MSRP and way cheaper than similarly-specced 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the Samsung 980 Pro ($260) or Crucial P5 Plus ($244).

                              <span>I think of Disney as a company that will protect their image by working on something until it&#x27;s both good and finished, which is frankly stupid of me given I just finished watching Obi-Wan Kenobi. Still, I found myself surprised when I learned that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be an early access game when it launches on September 6th.

Its name also does most of my job for me: this is a game about constructing islands, right? And then you build trains on them, yeah? It&#x27;s &quot;coming soon&quot; and it looks delightful in GIFs the developer has been posting on Twitter.

                              <span>Mojang Studios announced Minecraft Legends during this month&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest, dubbing it an &quot;action strategy&quot; Minecraft spin-off that&#x27;s being made in collaboration with Blackbird Interactive, the folks behind Homeworld 3 and Hardspace Shipbreaker. And that was the extent of our knowledge at the time. Well, thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct Mini, we got the briefest slice of new gameplay which expands our knowledge just a smidge further. Seems fun? I think?

                              <span>Overwatch 2 sees the start of its second closed beta test today, which runs until July 18th. You’ll need to wait for 7pm BST/11am PST to arrive before you can jump into the beta though. It’s also the first proper opportunity to play as the new tank Junker Queen, revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase earlier this month.

                              <span>I thought Sonic Frontiers was less Breath Of The Wild and more Super Mario Odyssey after I&#x27;d given it whirl in LA at Summer Geoff Fest. Despite its rough edges, Frontier&#x27;s open-ish world was a joy to blitz around as a hedgehog renowned for going particularly fast. But there was one thing I couldn&#x27;t talk about – Cyberspace stages: Bite-sized levels à la classic Sonic. And here&#x27;s why it might&#x27;ve been one of the best bits of the demo.

I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we&#x27;d like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn&#x27;t a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it&#x27;s 2005, baby, and they struggled. I&#x27;m okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn&#x27;t have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

                              <span>Also in Steam Deck news, Valve’s Lawrence Yang – a designer who worked on the on the handheld PC – has weighed in on a widely shared mod that replaces the pre-installed SSD with a larger, faster model. His advice: don’t do it.


The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

                              <span>The Department of Justice and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have just announced the seizure of six music piracy domains.

                              <span>In a landmark case, Kenya&#x27;s High Court approved a permanent injunction that requires local ISPs to block 44 sports streaming sites. The case was filed by entertainment giant  MultiChoice, which owns the broadcast rights to popular sports events. A proposal to repeal the applicable law was submitted in Parliament last year, but that ultimately failed.

                              <span>Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

Lots of things with no end, basically. It&#x27;s also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon&#x27;s core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it&#x27;s fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

                              <span>Czech file-sharing and hosting platform Ulož.to must block searches and downloads related to six movies, the Supreme Court has confirmed. The Court rejected a request from rightsholders for more far-reaching anti-piracy filters but confirmed that online services can also be required to use technical restrictions for other content.

                              <span>During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Gamescom returns as a hybrid in-person/online event this August, and the pieces have begun falling into – and in several cases, out of – place. Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.
See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull &amp; Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.</span>

The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.</span>

                              <span>An in-depth study among 50 Harvard lawyers shows that downloading and streaming pirated content is widely tolerated and even supported by some. It is certainly not seen as a form of theft by these legal experts. Based on these findings, the researchers call for a paradigm shift where entertainment providers focus more on convenience, accessibility and affordability.

                              <span>Space Bob vs. The Replicons is an ambitious 2D game about flying your spaceship onto a procedurally generated planet surface, gathering resources and tethering them to your ship, then blasting back into orbit to explore more of outerspace. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it below, but it&#x27;s not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t buy every iteration of FIFA, but I do want to give each entry a whirl to see how it has rebalanced the balls, tweaked the kicks, and polished the grass. Xbox Game Pass now helps me in my tests by, eventually, adding each iteration, and FIFA 22 is now available through the subscription service as part of June&#x27;s haul of new games.

Also added this past week: the Shadowrun Trilogy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Naraka: Bladepoint. And Far Cry 5 will arrive on July 1st.

If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam... Until earlier today, when Blade Runner Classic was added to the Steam version, too.

                              <span>New Ipsos research carried out on behalf of Italian anti-piracy group FAPAV reveals that 43% of the adult population engaged in some type of audiovisual piracy in 2021, with almost a quarter using pirate IPTV. Despite the gloom, overall piracy volumes are down 53% on figures reported in 2016 but FAPAV says that Italy needs to do much better.

The takedown request was sent by the ESA, which acts on behalf of Nintendo and other game companies. The problem hasn&#x27;t been sorted out completely, however, as nostalgic games can easily find alternatives, even on GitHub.

                              <span>In response to persons unknown sending large numbers of fake DMCA notices to YouTube while impersonating its anti-piracy partner, Bungie filed a lawsuit in the US seeking millions in damages. At the time the name of the &#x27;Doe&#x27; defendant was unknown. This is how a Bungie investigation followed digital breadcrumbs to track down and identify that person by name and physical address.

                              <span>The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I&#x27;m honest. Even the ones I&#x27;ve enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren&#x27;t the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it&#x27;s precisely because it&#x27;s not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It&#x27;s not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it&#x27;s all the more faithful for that.

                              <span>In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I&#x27;m willing to bet that &quot;pluviophile&quot; would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I&#x27;m doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I&#x27;ll be out frolicking in the downpour before they&#x27;ve hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can&#x27;t. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It&#x27;s time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you&#x27;ll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature&#x27;s greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s time to frolick. No umbrella required.

                              <span>A pair of new hidden object games have a pleasingly straightforward name to describe their inception: I Commissioned Some Bees. The developer paid illustrators to draw pictures with bees, and you can find the bees. It&#x27;s quite fun to find the bees. I got into hidden object games a few years back with the lovely Hidden Folks and the vast 100 Hidden X series, and today have enjoyed poring over colourful and often surreal landscapes to find our striped friends.

                              <span>We finally got our first glimpse of Starfield at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase at Summer Geoff Fest, having seen lots of clips of Todd Howard speaking words with devs who nodded across tables. I partly share the same opinion as Alice Bee, who thought the game could&#x27;ve shown us anything and they chose grey rocks again.
What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game&#x27;s reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let&#x27;s investigate.

Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell &quot;Requiem&quot;. The second is &#x27;What would it be like if you had the power of rats?&#x27;. The third is, &#x27;What if rats had any power to have?&#x27;. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called &#x27;What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn&#x27;t delayed until next year?&#x27;.

                              <span>There are two reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.
