We are so, so close to getting our hands on the fantastic-looking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. One thing Dotemu and Tribute Games have been focusing on is capturing the essence of the hugely popular old &#x27;87 cartoon and the beat &#x27;em ups of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, and what better way to do that than by diving into the game&#x27;s audiovisual design.
In the third behind-the-scenes video from Dotemu, we get a little bit of a taste behind the creative process of the game&#x27;s animators and find out just what inspired the music of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge.

Publisher GameMill Entertainment has announced that Little League World Series Baseball 2022 will be making its way to Switch on August 17th.
With suitably bright colours and child-friendly visuals, the game looks to be a fresh alternative on the Nintendo developed sports titles on the Switch, promising extensive customisation options and up to four-player local multiplayer.

                              <span>Farming, Fighting, And Fishbo.
Moonstone Island is one of the games we&#x27;re most excited about this year, and judging by the response from the other times we&#x27;ve covered it, we&#x27;re not alone. The game, which combines Minish Cap aesthetics with a deckbuilding spin on a Pok√©mon-like battle system, plus farming, crafting, and alchemy, feels like it has something for everyone, and it helps that the art is gorgeous, too.
We spoke to the Moonstone Island developers, Supersoft Studios, following on from the announcement during the June 2022 Wholesome Direct that they&#x27;ll be working with Raw Fury to publish the game. We&#x27;ve also got this lovely new trailer, which shows off some of the combat, fishing, foraging, house decorating, and farming that the game has to offer.

                              <span>But it&#x27;s been a quiet month.
May&#x27;s NPD results have been shared, and the figures reveal that May has been a relatively quiet month for the video game industry.
The industry overall has seen a 19% drop in sales (for hardware, games, and accessories) compared to a year ago, and at $3.7 billion, this is the lowest monthly spending total since February 2020. Year-to-date spending has also seen a 10% drop compared to the same period in 2021, with subscription gaming the only aspect that&#x27;s seen year-on-year growth.

We&#x27;ve got the full sales data for the month of May in Japan and it was another strong performance for the Nintendo Switch, surprising absolutely no one.
Nintendo Switch Sports took the top spot in terms of game sales, shifting almost 420,000 units after its launch on April 29th. This performance puts the game just behind its 2006 sibling Wii Sports at 553,000 units, which if you recall wasn&#x27;t bundled with the Wii console in Japan.

Fire Emblem fans are feasting right now. We&#x27;re just a little under two weeks away from the release of Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, a Musou game set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses world. Three Houses itself has been hugely successful for Intelligent Systems on Switch. And Fire Emblem Heroes continues to be extremely popular with fans.
Yet there&#x27;s more to come for those that love this strategy RPG series. Known Nintendo leaker and Nintendo World Report contributor Emily Rogers has revealed that Intelligent Systems has been working on a new Fire Emblem game for the Switch ‚Äî and it&#x27;s a brand new game, not a remake or a rerelease.

We&#x27;re in the middle of trailer season, with showcases and presentations aplenty! And in yesterday&#x27;s Guerrilla Collective showcase, we spotted something that might be one to hide from your kids.

A major discovery has been made on the cancelled Super Nintendo Kirby game, Kid Kirby. This unusual title, which was being developed by DMA Design (who are now Rockstar North ‚Äî yes, that Rockstar North), the game was meant to use the Super NES Mouse to launch Kirby across the levels, but slow development and poor sales of the mouse caused the project to be cancelled.
Given the scarcity of information on the game, @KidKirbyArchive has been set up by @Meeper12346 (who formerly ran @FactsKirby) to document as much as possible on Kid Kirby. And in creating this account, brand new information, including manual scans and some story details, has been discovered.

Tactics Ogre: Reborn leaked on the PlayStation store overnight, but has since been removed, but not before eager fans could get hold of the stunning new key art and the icon.

It&#x27;s generally accepted these days that Nintendo was the first major company to introduce region locking to its products, limiting their use outside specific regions or territories. Heck, if you simply Google &#x27;region locking&#x27; and take a peek at the Wikipedia entry, it says the following:

&quot;Nintendo was the first console maker to introduce regional locks to its consoles, and used them for every one of its consoles except the Nintendo Switch, while mostly eschewing them for its handheld products.&quot;

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up, though.
Ubisoft has announced that it will be broadcasting a special Assassin&#x27;s Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration Livestream, complete with a look back on the franchise&#x27;s history along with a few teases as to what&#x27;s to come later in the year.
The livestream will kick off at 9am PT / 5pm BST / 6pm CEST. As for what it&#x27;ll actually contain, we&#x27;d honestly be surprised if there&#x27;s anything Switch related; Ubisoft is likely to focus primarily on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and its newly released Discovery Tour accompaniment. We&#x27;re also expecting to see information on new comics, books, and other media, and possibly a glimpse at the much-discussed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity.

Giving fans of the classic series a chance to show off their love for all things yellow and flamey, the company has listed a small range of products on its official UK store. It&#x27;s all very much on brand, which should be perfect for anyone who sunk hours into the original on their GameCube or Sega Dreamcast, or anyone who&#x27;s just patiently waiting for the rumoured series reboot to appear.

We can&#x27;t really think of Pok√©mon without thinking about playing with our friends. Whether it&#x27;s battling, trading, or exploring secret bases, playing and sharing experiences with others feels like a vital aspect of the series. Yet one of these features was almost not included in the original Pok√©mon Red &amp; Blue.
Multiplayer battles have become pretty much their own thing nowadays, with competitions worldwide and the availability of WiFi and online battling, but Game Freak almost didn&#x27;t program it into the game. Pok√©mon Red &amp; Blue (or Red &amp; Green in Japan) was a step away from the action games that Game Freak was used to making.

With that in mind, we thought we&#x27;d share some, too! The editorial team has already presenting some of their own predictions, which you can check out right here, but now it&#x27;s the turn of our beloved video team, who met up for real in real life for the first time ever... for real!
Yes that&#x27;s right: Alex, Zion, and Felix finally got together to break bread, clink glasses, and share a few not-E3 Nintendo Direct predictions. Will we finally see some footage of Metroid Prime 4? What about the much-rumoured re-release of GoldenEye 007? Maybe Hollow Knight: Silksong will finally release?

                              <span>Featuring Junker Queen and a new map
Leading into the Overwatch 2 &quot;reveal event&quot; on June 16, Blizzard let it out that the next phase of testing is just around the corner. Sign-ups and full details will be shared during the stream (which starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific), but for now, we know that the Overwatch 2 beta will begin on June 28, and it&#x27;ll include PC and console players this time around.
https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1536755605238697984
In terms of new content for this beta, an unnamed &quot;new map&quot; will join the rotation, and this will be players&#x27; first crack at Junker Queen, a long-time-coming Tank hero who appeared during Sunday&#x27;s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase. If you missed it, Blizzard also confirmed that Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play and launch on October 4, 2022.
My big takeaway recently as a Support player? Moira&#x27;s deteriorating arm! Did you spot it?
PC, PlayStation, and Xbox
While Overwatch 2 is coming to all consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch), it would somewhat unsurprisingly seem that this beta will be limited to PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net based on those logos in the announcement image.
So far, PvP has been front and center, but plenty of lapsed Overwatch players are holding out for something special with PvE to bring them back into the fold ‚Äî I hope the June 16 event gives us some much-needed clarity on that front. My time with the previous Overwatch 2 PC beta was short and not that sweet, and Chris wasn&#x27;t really feeling it either in his initial check-in. After some updates (I&#x27;m still laughing about Zenyatta&#x27;s high-impact kick) and admissions that there&#x27;s much more to be done, I feel like there is a way to eventually ignite widespread excitement for the sequel, but it&#x27;s been pretty dicey so far.
According to the team, they&#x27;ve &quot;only just scratched the surface.&quot; So let&#x27;s hear it!

There&#x27;s some new Elden Ring quality of life features afoot, courtesy of patch 1.05, which just dropped this week.
One big change? Bell Bearings (items that let you buy new items from shops after being turned in) will carry over to New Game+ runs. It sounds small, but it&#x27;s a really nice change that streamlines multiple playthroughs. In short, you only need to find those items one time and they&#x27;ll augment all future playthroughs: rather than go through the tediousness of doing them over and over.
The team also shored up information via in-game menus, and added sound effects when other summon signs pop up. On PC, several Elden Ring quality of life features have been added, including a &quot;return to desktop&quot; option that was inexplicably missing day one. Mouse and keyboard detec‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>&quot;Post-nuclear Pittsburgh&quot;
We&#x27;re getting a new update for Fallout 76 this very week (today actually!), but Bethesda is already looking to September with a new look at The Pitt update.
As part of the Summer of Gaming festivities, we got some extra footage at the update, which is now confirmed for September.
Here&#x27;s a quick story primer:
&quot;For the first time since Fallout 3, players are invited to journey back to post-war Pittsburg - now a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict and awash with radiation. Expeditions: The Pitt introduces a new storyline centered around two warring factions: the blue-collar freedom fighters of the Union, and the power-hungry raider faction of the Fanatics.&quot;

So the entire thing will be tied to expeditions, the public event-adjacent mechanic that was the focus of the Test Your Metal update today. We&#x27;ll also get more &quot;tweaks and enhancements to the game,&quot; including a tease for &quot;adjusted gear for brand-new [players].&quot; In addition to adding more content for endgame folks (level 50 or higher is recommended for The Pitt), we&#x27;re getting early game enhancements too. Seems smart!
Like every major free update for¬†Fallout 76 this could invigorate lapsed players, but Bethesda seems to be putting extra effort into this one on that front.

It&#x27;s time for an Assassin‚Äôs Creed anniversary recap! It&#x27;s been 15 years since the series first debuted on Xbox 360 and PS3 with Alta√Ør in November 2007, and Ubisoft is celebrating a little early during the so-called Summer of Gaming with a stream.
Here&#x27;s everything that happened during the nearly hour and a half anniversary celebration.

Valhalla is getting more free content and an eventual end to Eivor&#x27;s story
More festivals, new mastery challenges (pack 2), extra tombs, and additional gear are coming to Valhalla as part of the &quot;Year 2&quot; content. The Forgotten Saga is a huge part of it, which is a new mode described as a &quot;roguelite journey through Niffelheim.&quot; All of it will be free, and &quot;the end of the year will have one last surprise:&quot; a ‚Ä¶</span>

Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear creator and all-around eccentric game-making dude, has offered further clarification on his studio&#x27;s relationship with industry giants PlayStation and Xbox, following on from his recent announcement that he will be working with the latter on an as-yet-unannounced new game.
Kojima made the initial announcement during Sunday&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, where the auteur appeared in a pre-recorded video to reveal that he would be working with Xbox to make a challenging, &quot;never-before-seen&quot; title that will be at the cutting-edge of Xbox technology.
&quot;It&#x27;s a completely new game that no one has ever experienced or seen before,&quot; noted Kojima in the video. &quot;I&#x27;ve waited very long for the day when I could finally start to create it.&quot;

These seem to be popular! In addition to a Final Fantasy VII stream this week from Square Enix, Ubisoft is holding an Assassins&#x27; Creed celebration stream today.
It&#x27;ll kick off at 12PM ET right here, or you can watch it below. Here&#x27;s the full description of what the¬†Assassin&#x27;s Creed stream entails:
&quot;Assassin‚Äôs Creed is turning 15! Tune in to celebrate the 15th anniversary with a special look at the future of Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla, a look back at the franchise, and a tease of what‚Äôs to come this year. The Ubisoft News team will be showcasing Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origin‚Äôs new 60 FPS gameplay update alongside producer, Jose Araiza before taking a look at the news and updates regarding all the latest and upcoming Assassin‚Äôs Creed comics, graphic novels, Manga, and more in Assassin‚Äôs Creed Stories.&quot;

That&#x27;s pretty descriptive! Whereas the¬†Final Fantasy 7 stream tease is woefully vague, this one tells us everything we need to know. It seems like the bigger focuses are¬†Valhalla, as well as¬†Origins 60 FPS footage (for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S): which is part of the new June update for the game. Then some cross-media stuff.
Remember, we have a full list of upcoming summer streams here.

Do we know the roster of Street Fighter 6? It is increasingly looking like we do. While some characters, namely Ryu, Chun-Li, Jamie, Luke, Guile, and apparently &quot;Kimberely&quot; have all been essentially confirmed, the mighty leak that rolled out last week appeared to fill in the remaining roster slots, giving us a grand total of 22 super-strong, (and super-stylish) World Warriors.
While Capcom has not officially confirmed the contents of the leak, it did begrudgingly admit that Street Fighter fans had &quot;seen more than they were supposed to&quot;, with the following Guile trailer ‚Äî complete with denim onesie ‚Äî more or less rubber stamps the leak as genuine. We have our Street Fighter 6 roster. Whether it&#x27;s a launch roster, or features numerous DLC characters... We‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Back to the farm
Nintendo has been struggling to provide Switch Online perks to users for some time, but one such perk is occasional game trials: sparing preview versions of full games during certain windows. The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently (NA is expected to get it at some point).
With my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they&#x27;re helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the &quot;news&quot; sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.
If you somehow haven&#x27;t played¬†Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you&#x27;re able to take part in the trial. It&#x27;s tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you&#x27;re going to be spending another 100 hours with it.
Also note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here,¬†which has been updated with details on weekly missions:¬†bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.
[Update:¬†As expected, this Stardew Valley Switch Online trial offer was added to the North American region this week. It&#x27;ll run from June 14 at 10AM PT until June 20 at 11:59PM PT. The game will also be 20% off during this time, and you can get 100 Platinum Points for participating in the trial.]

Yes indeed, we are less than a month away from the long-time-coming launch of anime fighter DNF Duel and publisher Nexon is still dropping character reveal trailers. Who&#x27;s that clomp, clomp, clomping her massive-ass shoes down the hallway? It&#x27;s the pint-sized voodoo queen herself, Enchantress!
Bedecked in Gothic-Lolita fashions and wearing an equally heavy look of mischief, Enchantress might be the smallest and youngest competitor to enter the DNF Duel ring, but what she lacks in size she makes up for in frightening black magic abilities. An expert in the ways of voodoo and the dark arts, Enchantress is able to conjure up projectiles and other weaponry twice her size, while also holding her own in CQC thanks to her super cute broomstick.

For roughly the past week,¬†Street Fighter¬†fans were met with mass confusion as to whether or not Fei Long would return to the series. But it seems as if this saga has come to an end.
The whole affair began when Daniel Lindholm, a composer for the¬†Street Fighter series, made a comment that Fei Long would never return to the franchise on a YouTube Q&amp;A session (which is now defunct/taken down, but was logged by several outlets). Here&#x27;s what they claimed:
&quot;A character that I know we won&#x27;t see at all ‚Äî there&#x27;s been a lot of discussion about it ‚Äî I mentioned earlier a character I would like to rewrite the music for would be Fei Long.

Resident Evil has one of the most loyal fanbases out there, and those who love the series have been looking forward to playing their favorite games of the series on next-gen consoles. Earlier this year, Capcom announced that they&#x27;d be able to do just that, because they had free updates for¬†Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 in the works for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

During today&#x27;s Capcom Showcase as part of the summer news blitz, they let us know that actually, these updated versions are available instantly. That was a nice surprise! The Xbox update will even be available with Xbox Smart Delivery, making it even easier for players to update to the best version for their console.
As reported a few months ago, the updated versions mostly just give us nicer graphics for each of the titles. It&#x27;s nice that a company would go out of their way to make sure their games look amazing, free of charge. Now go and download your free update!

                              <span>Head back into the Village
Capcom is finally bringing some DLC to¬†Resident Evil Village, and it&#x27;s pretty hefty. The¬†Resident Evil Village¬†Winter&#x27;s Expansion packs in more Mercs content, a story for Rose, and a whole lot more on Oct. 28, 2022.
The big ticket item here is Shadows of Rose, a new story set in the¬†Village¬†universe following Rosemary Winters. It seems to get pretty mind-twisting and creepy, but for those who dig the expanded world of Resident Evil, that&#x27;s a pretty interesting set-up.
Shadows of Rose is set 16 years after the events of¬†Resident Evil Village, and the story sees Rose entering the consciousness of the Megamycete. Here, she has to deal with her pasts and nightmares. And apparently also a very evil, Persona¬†palace version of the Duke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IJDIenuQepo
If story isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for, there&#x27;s also the addition of a third-person mode, making it feel a bit more like a classic¬†Resident Evil¬†game. This new vantage point offers a new outlook, and possibly a little more distance between you and all the hand-based injuries Ethan suffers in¬†Village.
Towering mercenaries, oh my
The Mercenaries game mode is also adding three additional characters: Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and the towering Lady Dimitrescu. Yes, Lady D fans rejoice. She&#x27;s finally playable. Plus, there are some new stages to add some new challenges.
The¬†Resident Evil Village expansion¬†comes either separate, for those who just need to pick up the additional content, or the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, which packs it all together.

The Winter&#x27;s Expansion and¬†Resident Evil Village Gold Edition¬†are out on Oct. 28, 2022.

                              <span>I hereby announce a video that may be nothing
During today&#x27;s Capcom Showcase live stream, director Hideaki Itsuno put in an appearance to relay a message about the popular fantasy RPG series Dragon&#x27;s Dogma.
While no actual announcements were made, Itsuno noted that the series celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, and that Capcom has prepared a special video to celebrate Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its games, lore, anime, and community. The video will go live on Thursday, June 16, at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The video will be available on Capcom&#x27;s social media channels such as YouTube and Twitter.
Now, it&#x27;s understandable that this seemed like a potential tease, and that perhaps the upcoming Dragon&#x27;s Dogma anniversary celebrations might be an opening to spotlight some new project related to the series ‚Äî the hungry fanbase would surely love such an exciting development. But it might be better for your health to temper those expectations and just enjoy the video without too high a hope. You would think that if Capcom did have a remake, remaster, sequel, or some other new title to announce, then they might have done it during tonight&#x27;s stream, or perhaps at last week&#x27;s Summer Game Fest.
So, just, keep yo&#x27;self in check... FOR NOW... (but really, don&#x27;t get your hopes up.)

During today&#x27;s Capcom Showcase, we got another check-in with Exoprimal, a PvPvE team action game about keeping the dinosaur hordes at bay, one crisis at a time. Some of us are open enough to this concept to want to at least give it a chance, and on that front, Capcom is hosting a closed network test for Exoprimal&#x27;s main mode, Dino Survival, on Steam.
Registration for the Exoprimal network test will open later today. According to Capcom, the team will take entries until June 29 at 4:59 p.m. Pacific. You can see a full breakdown of the network test on the website, but here are the play times:
Session 1 ‚Äî July 11, 2022 (Mon) 0:00 - 2:59 (UTC)
Session 2 ‚Äî July 25, 2022 (Mon) 0:00 - 5:59 (UTC)

                              <span>A closer look at the spookier monsters
Capcom delivered what will likely be the last of the major Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak trailers before its June 30 release today during the Capcom Showcase stream. Oh, and a¬†Sunbreak demo is coming soon!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AzplEyeMdzc
Here are a few of the monsters shown off today in the Sunbreak trailer:
Espinas (from Monster Hunter Frontier)
Gore Magala (from Monster Hunter 4)
Daimyo Hermitaur (from Monster Hunter 2) - and the Pyre subspecies
Malzeno (part of the demo)
Lucent Nargacuca (coming in an August 22 free title update)
The jungle area from the second generation of the franchise returns, and the &quot;endemic jungle&quot; elements have been updated for the modern generation. You&#x27;ll be able to test these out in a solo/multiplayer demo that&#x27;s out on June 14. There will be no limit to the demo (thank goodness), and it&#x27;s available on both eShop and PC.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;isosNYy4axw
Here are the main Sunbreak demo hunts:
Astalos
Tetranadon
Great Izuchi
Malzeno (an extra challenge)

Did you notice that sneaky bit of a Lucent Nargacuca addition via a title update? Vague Sunbreak roadmap updates are planned for:
August 2022
Fall 2022
Winter 2022
With &quot;more to come in 2023&quot;
Given how¬†Iceborne extended the life of¬†Monster Hunter World for a bit, it&#x27;s only fair that¬†Sunbreak will also have its own string of free updates.

                              <span>GoldenEye 007 redefined the shooter genre when it launched on Nintendo 64 in 1997. Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare&#x27;s acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the¬†influential FPS.¬†


The trailer, uploaded on IGN, features¬†snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight.¬†
GoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.

                              <span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human&#x27;s roadmap revealed five years of planned DLC. A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update ‚Äì 1.4.0 ‚Äì drops today with the first &quot;Chapter,&quot; bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure.¬†
So, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission.¬†
Of course, there&#x27;s also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun ‚Äì we&#x27;re talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph.¬†
Like its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden&#x27;s already-harrowing journey.

                              <span>Monster Hunter Rise kicked off the Capcom Showcase today, with new locations for hunters to explore on full display, along with plenty more monsters to take the fight to when the expansion releases. A demo will also be available starting tomorrow.
First off is the return of the Jungle area from the second generation of Monster Hunter, which has been completely redone for Sunbreak. While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it&#x27;s situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to explore.


As for new monsters to hunt, Sunbreak has a lot of exciting new targets to take on. Espinas makes its return from Monster Hunter Frontiers. As its name implies (&quot;espinas&quot; is Spanish for thorns), this creature is covered in sharp spines that wi‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames ‚Äì usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.
Exoprimal&#x27;s main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.


Those mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.
Interestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you‚Äôre fighting against, you‚Äôll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.
Capcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you‚Äôre interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.
Exoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake ‚Äì including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing.¬†
Director Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president&#x27;s daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don&#x27;t go well.¬†


We then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. &quot;We want to nail the feeling of loneliness¬†and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,&quot;¬†Hirabayashi said during the presentation. &quot;Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.&quot;
You&#x27;d be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look¬†came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest ‚Äì which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the¬†first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4.¬†
I&#x27;m more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would&#x27;ve loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn&#x27;t in the cards today. Here&#x27;s hoping we&#x27;ll get a better look in the future.</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil Village made a surprise¬†return during today&#x27;s Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.


In this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she&#x27;s struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that&#x27;s where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.
Capcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.
Lastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.
If you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won&#x27;t have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.</span>

                              <span>Last week with the release of Blender 3.2 bringing AMD HIP support for Linux to provide for Radeon GPU acceleration, I posted some initial benchmarks of AMD Radeon RX 6000 series with HIP against NVIDIA RTX with OptiX. There was interest by some Phoronix readers in also seeing NVIDIA CUDA results even though OptiX is in good shape with RTX GPUs, so with that here are results of NVIDIA CUDA vs. NVIDIA OptiX vs. AMD HIP with Blender 3.2 on Ubuntu Linux.</span>

                              <span>One of my personal gripes with AMD&#x27;s Zen CPU support on Linux has been the lack of timely support for CPU temperature monitoring with their &quot;k10temp&quot; driver. Even though usually just new IDs are often needed and sometimes needing to adjust offsets or other minor changes, it has traditionally been done post-launch and sometimes left up to patches from the open-source community. Thankfully that has been changing and with Zen 4 it looks like that support will be ready for launch-day with the mainline Linux kernel...</span>

                              <span>A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a &quot;farmadventure&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it&#x27;s very peaceful, and there&#x27;s no death (a &quot;survival game without survival&quot;). It&#x27;s all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

It‚Äôs not the new Commandos game that you might be hoping for, but at least it‚Äôs World War something. Synchronise watches by viewing the trailer below.

There was no word on whether either game would make their way to Steam like Persona 4 Golden, though. Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve‚Äôs storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

He‚Äôs one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot‚Äôs alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace‚Äôs de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It‚Äôs hard to laugh at Zane‚Äôs baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000‚Äôs. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson‚Äôs and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? ‚Ä¶right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There‚Äôs a short demo available as part of Steam‚Äôs most recent Next Fest, and I‚Äôm delighted to say it‚Äôs exactly what I hoped it would be.

                              <span>While the official way to win 20 Minutes Till Dawn is to survive 20 minutes of monster attacks, I disagree. Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter&#x27;s real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I&#x27;ve beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I&#x27;m delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn. I finally won.

Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter&#x27;s Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious &quot;powers&quot;, Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game&#x27;s main campaign.

                              <span>When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight&#x27;s Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

After a busy weekend, it feels like we&#x27;re pretty deep into the summer gaming showcase schedule, but there&#x27;s still time to hear from some of the big publishers. Next on the list is Capcom, and with Street Fighter 6 and Resident Evil 4 on the way, it&#x27;s easy to be stoked. The Capcom Showcase begins at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today and will last &quot;roughly 35 minutes.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Q48j01h_IGg
Capcom says the showcase will cover &quot;details and news on previously announced titles.&quot;
Further keeping expectations in check, the company specifically mentioned the stream will focus on upcoming games like Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Exoprimal, and Resident Evil 4. Anything else could just be a bonus ‚Äî but don&#x27;t let that stop you from hoping for more.
I know Moyse wants to see another Street Fighter 6 character trailer before the team steps out of the spotlight for a bit, and I&#x27;m hoping to hear concrete details about the mysterious Resident Evil Village DLC that could be anything at this point. Barring that, an &quot;out later today!&quot; release of RE2, RE3, and RE7 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S would be nice.

With every year that goes by, I am in worse shape than the year before. Not that I‚Äôve ever been the picture of health, but I do fine. I walk (ten steps) to work. My diet is well-balanced (pizza). I get plenty (an excess) of sleep. However, after getting on anti-anxiety medication a few years back, I gained a few (40) pounds and haven‚Äôt been able to shed a single one of them.
I‚Äôve tried all the hottest exercises: Wii Fit, Ring Fit, uh‚Ä¶ walking my dog, getting out of bed, making tea. However, they all tire me out and take time out of my busy napping schedule. So, I thought, ‚Äúwhat would get me to commit to a workout?‚Äù Obviously, that‚Äôs going to be if it‚Äôs part of an 8-bit retro game. That‚Äôs something that can definitely get me to commit (for maybe an hour.)

Since I played it back in 2018, Oxenfree has been one of my favorite games. It&#x27;s one of those stories that&#x27;s character-focused on top of everything else it has going for it, like a gorgeous art style, amazing VO performances, and one of the best implementations of a dialogue system in a game I&#x27;ve ever seen. I even found the gameplay, which mostly involves walking and climbing around Edwards Island, to be really engaging, mostly because of the conversations the characters had. For me, it captures the coming-of-age magic that something like Stranger Things season one had, and it&#x27;s one of the best narrative games of the last decade.
As one would expect, I&#x27;m pretty stoked for the sequel. I had been following any news surrounding Oxenfree II: Los‚Ä¶</span>

As the regional rollout continues, Sony has launched its new tiered PlayStation Plus subscription plans in North America. Many of us will be sticking with the most basic membership (which is now known as PlayStation Plus Essential), but you can see how much it&#x27;ll cost to upgrade to Extra or Premium on this info-heavy overview page. Another handy link: the list of games and which tiers they&#x27;re tied to, including PlayStation Classics, some of which can be purchased standalone on PS4/PS5 without needing a membership.
That&#x27;s exactly what I was curious to check out personally speaking (and for the purposes of this article), and there&#x27;s at least one surprise in the PS1 library on day one: Resident Evil Director&#x27;s Cut. S‚Ä¶</span>

Whatever happened to Marissa Marcel? That&#x27;s the question at the core of Immortality, the latest from Sam Barlow&#x27;s Half Mermaid. It&#x27;s the third mystery from Barlow and co. told in full-motion video, or FMV, but it&#x27;s much more than a retread. In some ways, Immortality&#x27;s match-cut deduction feels like it was inevitable.
I recently had a chance to both chat with the crew at Half Mermaid and play a short snippet of Immortality. And what&#x27;s striking about Immortality at first is how simply it starts. Much like Her Story and Telling Lies, Barlow&#x27;s latest is told through a user interface; rather than a computer text interface though, it&#x27;s essentially a recreation of an old Moviola machine.

                              <span>Tech-heavy title headed to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch
Anybody up for a little over-dramatic swordplay in an electrical storm should keep watch on the calendar for the remainder of the year, as Playism and the hugely talented Studio FYQD have announced that the hi-tech, first-person, slash &#x27;n&#x27; shoot sequel Bright Memory: Infinite will be arriving on console platforms later this year.
https://youtu.be/n2uSETOP8pw
Already available on PC, Bright Memory: Infinite is a sequel/revamp to the original cult hit Bright Memory, which tells the tale of a Battle Angel Alita-type hero who utilizes razor-sharp swordplay, ballistic gunplay, and an array of bio-weaponry to battle inter-dimensional invaders. While neither title is particularly long, (lasting a mere hour and change), Bright Memory is lauded for its staggering revelation that it was entirely designed, coded, and built by a single developer ‚Äî making its highly impressive visuals and breathless gameplay all the more fascinating.
While Bright Memory: Infinite is admittedly a little more about its concept and invention than its actual execution, it still makes for a fun couple of hours, with combat that can be snugly described as a first-person Devil May Cry. The console editions have been tweaked to include extra features ‚Äî such as DualSense integration ‚Äî and the PS5 and Xbox Series X editions are expected to run a silky-smooth 120 FPS when in Performance Mode. Swish. Check out Chris Carter&#x27;s review right here.
Bright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X and Switch this year.

Microsoft and the Communication Workers of America have entered into a labor neutrality agreement ahead of the Activision Blizzard deal&#x27;s closure. The pact would, once the deal has gone through, ensure Microsoft takes a neutral approach should employees at Activision Blizzard consider forming a union.
The labor neutrality agreement will take effect 60 days after Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard closes. In a press release from the CWA, it says the agreement reflects a belief by both organizations that &quot;enabling workers to freely and fairly make a choice about union representation will benefit Microsoft and its employees.&quot;

Nintendo just put out a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character reveal, which showcases the tank class in action.
The first reveal actually comes via the Nintendo of Europe Twitter account, which gives us a quick translated rundown of the character (notice the High Entia wing design on their head):
&quot;Zeon is a Keves soldier and a reliable hero who‚Äôll go above and beyond to protect his allies in #XenobladeChronicles3. Armed with a sword and shield, Zeon‚Äôs abilities are enhanced when he‚Äôs pitted against stronger enemies.&quot;

Next, we have to hover back over to the Japanese Nintendo Twitter account, because this is how Nintendo delivers segmented chunks of news these days, even on bigger games.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character trailer:
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1536244016907694082
Through the above account, we actually get a much better look at the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Zeon character reveal in video form, which more than does its job. Big sword? Check. Protecting the party? Check.
I&#x27;m a sucker for tank characters, and the getup of knight armor and an anime glowing sword and shield really do it for me. It&#x27;s going to be hard to push this character out of my forever party unless Monolith Soft has something really special up its sleeve.

It&#x27;s time to jump on your skateboard, grab your Sinner&#x27;s Sandwich, and frame rate into oblivion, as Rising Star Games has announced that Swery65&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek-but-also-actually-bad Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is now available on PC via the Steam Store.
As a quick refresher, Deadly Premonition 2 was the long-awaited follow-up to the notoriously goofy 2010 release, Deadly Premonition. The sequel features a dual storyline that sees put-upon investigator Francis Zach/York Morgan investigating a Bostonian murder in the past, while being interrogated over said case and its horrendous aftermath in the present. Guide our hero in past and present as they uncover the sinister psychological torment that lies beneath the surface of the sublime Le Carr√©.

While Deadly Premonition 2 features the strange dialogue, goofy action sequences, and overall sense of compelling weirdness that is the series&#x27; trademark, it was also lambasted at launch for its myriad technical issues, some of which went beyond the realm of parody and into poor value. Unfortunately, according to reports in the Steam forums, it seems that this new port carries its own weight in both new and old technical issues, (though it seems that the frame rate issues have been fixed).
In true Deadly Premonition style, it seems that this release is really just for those who have no problem dropping cash on irony, warts and all. Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch. The Steam port is being sold at a discounted price until June 18.

                              <span>As in, 65,535 variations instead of two editions
The original pitch for the entire concept of Pokemon unique versions included more than two! Tens of thousands were in the cards, actually. Through unearthed documents and interviews, Did You Know Gaming made a discovery of their own recently: the original pitch for¬†Pokemon involved exactly 65,535 different versions of the same fundamental game. Let&#x27;s break this down.
Why did Pokemon have 65,535 versions?
Originally, Game Freak wanted each and every copy of the game (in the initial run at least) to feel special. As such, games would ship with a unique version of what became known as¬†Pokemon Red/Blue [Green], with tens of thousands of variations. That means different Pokemon (which forces more trades), or apparently (and this is partially wha‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Update 3.0 brings balance tweaks and flashy finishes
Mane6 has released the long-in-development Update 3.0 for its equestrian smackeroonie Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds ‚Äî the update, now live on PC, brings with it a fresh balance of bug fixes, a balance overhaul, and, best of all, some lovely looking Level 3 cinematic Supers for the entire roster!
Each and every character can now activate a new Super when their super meter is stocked to its third stage. The new Supers take Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds to a whole new level, with gorgeous, cartoony, and very amusing attacks to put a big, dramatic finish on your beatdown. From Arizona&#x27;s lasso-crazy multi-slam, to Paprika&#x27;s ultra hug of death, Tianhuo&#x27;s demonstration of their martial arts expertise, and Pom&#x27;s Akuma-esque touch of death ‚Äî these new supers are packed with personality and character.

In addition, all current and future TFH players can now download DLC character Shanty free of charge. Incidentally, the G.O.A.T. herself has perhaps my favorite super, featuring a barrage of cannonballs from her nearby ship, ending in a spectacular explosion. Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds has spent the past four years building upon its great foundation, determined to prove itself a major contender among its big-budget contemporaries. It&#x27;s a great fighter, no doubt, and the console release ‚Äî officially called for later in 2022 ‚Äî will be sure to add more than a few new disciples to the herd.
Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds is available now on PC. It will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms this fall.¬† You can check out the full list of balance tweaks and bug fixes over on Steam.

                              <span>Scroll down on the giveaway page a bit
GOG is giving away a free Shantae and the Pirate&#x27;s Curse PC copy, in case you don&#x27;t own the game already.

So here&#x27;s a quick rundown of how to redeem the free Shantae and the Pirate&#x27;s Curse copy on GOG:
The landing page of the game is here: you&#x27;ll need to click &quot;go to giveaway&quot; to head to the main site to actually redeem it.
On this giveaway page, you&#x27;ll find the &quot;add this game to your account&quot; button roughly halfway in: just look for the¬†Shantae image.
You have roughly 46 hours from the time of publication to actually claim the game. Note that you&#x27;ll need to (at least temporarily) agree with marketing communications from GOG to claim it, and have a logged-in account to boot.
Definitely do it, even if you have no intention of playing it anytime soon! Pirate&#x27;s Curse is an interesting deviation from the Shantae formula, as it sees the titular character losing her genie powers in favor of going on a more traditional adventure. Some folks still consider it their favorite in the franchise, and given the aforementioned conceit, it&#x27;s a great entry point.
This is your chance to dive into the series!

                              <span>You have until June 19
In case you missed it,¬†Ark 2 was shown over the weekend at the Microsoft conference. But before that actually arrives sometime in 2023, there&#x27;s a free¬†Ark (the original) promo going on over on Steam. It typically goes for $29.99 on the platform.
As usual, the standard provisos apply. The team could cut off the offer as it runs until &quot;supplies last,&quot; though it&#x27;s not particularly common for this to happen. Also, you don&#x27;t get Steam trading cards via free games like this. Note that there is a cutoff time! You have until June 19 at 10:00AM PT to click &quot;own.&quot; Just go log in and do it here in browser form!
After you pick the game up, there&#x27;s a decent chunk of free and paid stuff to grab. Beyond the $29.99 season pass (which is on sale for $23.99 at the moment), there&#x27;s also several expansion maps that you can pick up for free, including &quot;Lost Island, Valguero, The Center, and Crystal Isles and Ragnarok&quot; variations. A &quot;Primitive Plus&quot; total conversion mod is also free, which is intriguing in and of itself: &quot;Primitive Plus is a free add-on for ARK: Survival Evolved that alters the available tools, weapons and structures in the game to reflect what humans could realistically create using primitive technology and resources. This does not simply remove advanced technology from ARK, but instead replaces it with a multitude of new resources, engrams and systems.&quot;
While¬†Ark¬†might not be for everyone (and the survival genre is sure to scare off droves of people on principle), you could spend an entire weekend diving into this game before realizing you don&#x27;t even like it.

Capcom has confirmed that its exciting new scrapper Street Fighter 6 will indeed have fully redesigned rollback netcode, and will not simply port the online infrastructure that powers previous entry Street Fighter V. The news was revealed by SF6 director Takayuki Nakayama in an interview with IGN. (Suspiciously, it appears that the interview has since been made private.)
&quot;SFV also had rollback netcode, but SF6 will have rollback netcode [but] it&#x27;s not going to be the same as what we had in SFV,&quot; said Nakayama (in dictation recorded by EventHubs). &quot;This is something that they&#x27;re building from scratch. There&#x27;s a lot of effort being put into the development of the netcode.&quot;
Street Fighter V has had something of a rocky history with online play. Casting our minds ‚Ä¶</span>

Playtonic Friends, the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic Games, has announced that it&#x27;s bringing Knight Shift Games and The Completionist&#x27;s Elsie to Switch in 2023.
Described as a neo-retro roguelike, Elsie combines run-and-gun gameplay with bullet hell elements and &quot;neon-drenched pixel art&quot;, as you can see from the reveal trailer above. Also releasing for PC, a Steam demo is available at the time of writing for those of you curious to find out more.

BUNNIES. Bunny Park is a game about BUNNIES. Obviously. And you&#x27;re in charge of them! You&#x27;ll have to feed them, entertain them, keep them happy, and try to stop them making too many extra bunnies, because that&#x27;s a very quick descent into a hellish, bunny-tsunami situation.
This September, Bunny Park will be heading to Switch, alongside another game from the same developer, Lemon Cake. You can build and decorate your own park, fill it with bunnies of all different kinds, care for them with snacks and pets, and complete your collection of buns.

                              <span>280mm is my favourite AIO liquid cooler size - cheaper than 360mm coolers while offering better performance per square inch - you just need a case that can accommodate the slightly larger fans. Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around ¬£100 to ¬£180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just ¬£50. That&#x27;s an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting.

That&#x27;s a historic low price on a keyboard that editor-in-chief Katharine called &#x27;probably the loveliest keyboard I&#x27;ve ever used&#x27;. 
High praise indeed, and it was enough to earn a coveted RPS recommendation - even at its original price. Now you can pick up this delightfully clicky keyboard with low profile mechanical switches, a full-size UK layout and a beautiful metal build for ¬£50 less.

                              <span>Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a &quot;story generator&quot; sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There&#x27;s no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you&#x27;ll have a great time doing it.

It‚Äôs the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it‚Äôs also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

                              <span>Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it&#x27;s a pretty big deal because they haven&#x27;t made something that isn&#x27;t a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda&#x27;s brand new IP made it look like they&#x27;ve accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we&#x27;ll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love. So like a cyberpunk Stardew Valley? Have a look in the new trailer.

                              <span>We finally glimpsed our first look at some in-game footage from interstellar RPG Starfield at yesterday‚Äôs Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and it had the feel of a less retro Fallout 4.

NotE3 was in full swing this weekend but wasn&#x27;t the only gawp-o-rama around, with Screenshot Saturday still giving looks at birds, a goth Deus Ex, and a vision of an open-world Sonic the Hedgehog chillout.

                              <span>The Wholesome Direct showcase had a whole lotta games once again, but one that really stood out to me was Paper Trail, because it looked and felt quite different. I&#x27;ve already elaborated on the key wholesome themes this year being witches and plants, and Paper Trail is neither of those. It is origami and puzzles. There&#x27;s a very cool free demo out now too, so you can see for yourself.

See, it‚Äôs like Thief but has guns. Oh, and Resident Evil 4‚Äôs inventory Tetris, which is possibly the best inventory system ever invented. Witness for yourself in the trailer below.

                              <span>There was a lot going on in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Paradox&#x27;s grand strategy game Victoria III aims to simulate pretty much all of it, starting in 1836 and giving you a century to play with. A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs.

                              <span>After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is¬†available today in North and South America. Here&#x27;s everything you&#x27;ll need to know about upgrading your plan.
Three tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get¬†in each tier can be found below.¬†
Upgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so,¬†go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you&#x27;ll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don&#x27;t panic. There is a way to change your subscription type.¬†
How To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly
There are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts &gt; Accounts &gt; Payment and Subscriptions &gt; Subscriptions. In there, you&#x27;ll find your PS+ subscription. Once you&#x27;ve entered your subscription details, you can change your plan.¬†
Selecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you&#x27;d like to pay for on a recurring basis.¬†
Once you&#x27;ve locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you&#x27;re ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you&#x27;re not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.</span>

Sonic Frontiers raced among 2022‚Äôs most anticipated games when it debuted¬†during the 2021 Game Awards. Sega has been secretive about what the open-world ‚Äì or rather ‚Äúopen-zone‚Äù ‚Äì game entails, agonizing fans eager to learn how the hedgehog fares in a larger world. During Summer Game Fest Play Days, I spent 30 minutes playing Frontiers to get a sense of how the adventure is shaping up so far. I still have many questions, but I walked away with clearer expectations and some glimmers¬†of hope.¬†

                              <span>An unexpected and fun surprise from the PC Gaming Show was the reveal of Klei Entertainment&#x27;s newest game. Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it&#x27;s expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.


Thanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It&#x27;s a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a¬†dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and¬†fortified as well.
In typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is¬†pushing the boundaries of making it look like you&#x27;re¬†controlling a cartoon character;¬†Rotwood&#x27;s¬†models¬†are expressive,¬†fluid, and bursting with personality. I can&#x27;t wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays¬†like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.
The trailer gave an early access date of &quot;202?&quot; which could be anytime in the next decade, though I&#x27;d expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted¬†on Steam, and it&#x27;s unknown whether Klei is planning¬†for release on any additional platforms at this time.</span>

It&#x27;s a very interesting laptop and well thought out for Linux use with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U SoC and integrated Radeon graphics for satisfying the preferences of many Linux developers preferring a fully open-source driver stack. Thanks to the large scale manufacturing of HP, it&#x27;s also a competitively-priced Linux laptop compared to many of the Linux laptops from smaller vendors that are based on Clevo or other white box laptop designs.</span>

All that is going to change when Season Seven of the MMO pirate &#x27;em up arrives next month, as confirmed in a jaunty song at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase. Players are getting a whole raft of &quot;Captaincy features&quot; - and these include being able to name your ship and customise the interior.

                              <span>Obsidian have announced that their co-op garden survival game Grounded will burst forth from early access into a full 1.0 release like a seed in your backyard this September. A story campaign playable in co-op or solo will explain how Grounded‚Äôs kids were shrunk by a mad scientist, and probably persuade me to finally give it a go. Watch out for colossal bugs in the trailer below.

This one at least has a firm-ish release date of November attached, though, and looks very pretty. Catch yourself up with the reveal by watching the trailer below.

Only, since it&#x27;s the new game from the developers of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine, I&#x27;m guessing the stakes are higher than whether Gywneth Paltrow gets it together with John Hannah. For one, you&#x27;re creating alternatve versions of yourself in order to survive on a rickety base rolling across an alien world.

Now the publishers Frozen Forge are back with The Constructors, revealed at the PC Gaming Show. The Constructors is a simulation game allowing you to climb up another rung on the parasite ladder (following on from last year&#x27;s landlord sim The Tenants, by the same devs Ancient Forge Studio) as you own a constuction company, and build and design housing estates.

The blend of action-adventure, stealth and seething hordes of rats is getting a sequel later this year, taking our miserable medieval tots Amicia and Hugo to the south of France for A Plague Tale: Requiem. In a gameplay trailer shown at the Xthesda showcase tonight we saw that Amicia is struggling with whether or not she should kill the heck out of soldiers, or try to stealth on by.

                              <span>It must be a relief to ActiBlizz to have some good Diablo 4 news, given how everyone on Earth is ragging on Diablo Immortal 24/8 (when we are not open-mouthed at the stream of terrible news about the company, from numerous allegations of harrassment, misconduct and discrimination, to the company advising shareholders to not approve a proposal to report on harassment and discrimination). But at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase tonight they were able to share that Diablo 4 is coming out next year for some much anticipated ARPG antics. Why, that&#x27;s the Diablo game people keep saying they want!
Plus, the Necromancer is confirmed as the fifth playable class. There&#x27;s a moody trailer that tries to make being a Necromancer sound twisted and dangerous and a hard path to walk, but it mostly makes it sound like Necromancers are cool badasses with loads of skeleton best friends.

Digging up a gameplay trailer at today‚Äôs Xthesda Games Showcase, Lightyear Frontier is taking farming to the final frontier in Spring 2023 - but that frontier includes Game Pass on day one. This planet may be on the edge of the galaxy, but it has good wifi.

                              <span>It was on the cards, and tonight at the XBox &amp; Bethesda Showcase we indeed got a look at some vampire slaying in Redfall. Arkane&#x27;s spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things. Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I&#x27;d see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there.

Those are free-to-play games, which means what you&#x27;ll really getting for your subscription is access to some of the bits that would normally be locked behind real money or the grind. In League Of Legends, for example, a Game Pass subscription will unlock all 160+ of the MOBA&#x27;s champions.

                              <span>The trailer for Morbid Metal from tonight&#x27;s Future Games Show had a lot of metal (the music genre) and metal (the stuff you make blades out of). Morbid Metal is a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash, but the difference here is that you have four different mech lads at your disposal, and you can morph between them whenever you like. This real-time switching means Morbid Metal moves very quickly. You might think hyphenated phrases like &quot;high-octane&quot;, &quot;action-packed&quot;, and &quot;fast-paced&quot; are moving in the direction of this game, but buddy this is going at such speed that they&#x27;re already here.

                              <span>Homeworld 3, threequel to the OG melancholy spaceship strategy series, has been delayed into the first half of next year. The developers say they need more time to make the engine trails glow just right, and to make the derelict megastructures mega enough. We will apparently see more of the game in action this August, though.

The very concept of Metal: Hellsinger appeals to me from the first note: Slay demons in a modern Doom-style first-person shooter to the beat of newly recorded tracks from some big names in rock and metal. As someone who grew up playing the original Doom and loves the modern iterations of the franchise, and has perhaps sunk more time into the Rock Band series than any¬†other franchise, The Outsiders&#x27; upcoming game checks a lot of boxes. Still, coming into my hands-on time with the game, I was skeptical. Thankfully, the short demo I played at Summer Game Fest (which is also a‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>After a long absence, Nightdive Studio&#x27;s remake of System Shock made an appearance at the PC Gaming Show, and it&#x27;s looking pretty cool. You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary¬†Warren Spector.


This new trailer for¬†System Shock gives a great look at the game&#x27;s visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game.¬†More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors¬†are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock,¬†is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.
System Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk,¬†and Children of Morta, is making something new and a bit more surreal. The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get¬†home from a mission that&#x27;s gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.


¬†
Jan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they&#x27;ll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters&#x27; ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.
During the presentation, 11 Bit Studios&#x27; Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says¬†the game has aspects of a psychological¬†thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a &quot;classic sci-fi&quot; story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It&#x27;s designed for players to create their own stories.
¬†

It seems like it&#x27;s far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.</span>

                              <span>The PC Gaming Show debuted an extended look at gameplay for a Sci-fi thriller from Starward Industries, The Invincible. What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.


The demo begins¬†from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local.¬†She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a¬†task it&#x27;s been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to¬†discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn&#x27;t at all safe. Then,¬†the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.
I&#x27;m not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can&#x27;t wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023¬†on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019‚Äôs The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November.¬†
Revealed during today‚Äôs Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating.¬†The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio‚Äôs Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game.¬†
Check out the trailer for yourself below:¬†


Here‚Äôs how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description:¬†
‚ÄúSet in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.‚Äù¬†
Pentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November.¬†

                              <span>As Dusk Falls, an interactive drama where you make choices that impact the characters&#x27; lives, made an appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase. The trailer, which was captured in-game,¬†not only looked intriguing but also¬†revealed the game&#x27;s launch date. And it&#x27;s next month!
On July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of &quot;betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience.&quot; The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you&#x27;ll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, &quot;Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.&quot; The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.
The multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it&#x27;s unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process.¬†
Guess we&#x27;ll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

Kojima also implied that it‚Äôs a new game, and thus likely not part of any existing franchise. He also spoke briefly about Microsoft‚Äôs cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.
It‚Äôs not much to go on, but it‚Äôs an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.
It will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.</span>

In a variety of gameplay clips, creator Todd Howard walked us through various gameplay aspects, revealing that this science-fiction RPG features over 1,000 planets to explore. From barren moons to heavily populated worlds, you can go where you want to see what you discover.
The first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants. In this regard, the color scheme is similar to Star Wars&#x27; Crait from The Last Jedi. Here, we are given our first taste of gameplay, which we see from bo‚Ä¶</span>

Today,¬†it¬†revealed¬†Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.
In the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs.¬†Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this¬†dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab¬†them through the head, so that&#x27;s pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin&#x27;s Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.
Ereban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.</span>

                              <span>Xbox has a history of showing off some of our favorite indies during its big showcases, and it looks like it&#x27;s keeping that tradition alive and well. During the platform&#x27;s Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.
Cocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players &quot;on an adventure across worlds within worlds,&quot; which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a¬†kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.


¬†There&#x27;s not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game&#x27;s Steam page goes into a little more detail.¬†
Cocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC¬†sometime in 2023. The trailer&#x27;s description indicates fans should get ready to &quot;master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.&quot;</span>

                              <span>We still don&#x27;t have a firm Diablo IV release date yet (other than 2023), but we now know every class we can play when it eventually releases. The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.
As you dive into dangerous open areas, you&#x27;ll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.


Diablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.
Blizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.</span>

                              <span>Koei Tecmo Games and Team Ninja have revealed Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and it‚Äôs coming to Xbox consoles and PC next year.¬†
Revealed during today‚Äôs Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks quite similar to Team Ninja‚Äôs Nioh series in that it features a ninja-like character fighting against not just humans, but monstrous and demonic monsters, too. The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn‚Äôt feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty‚Äôs world.


As you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here‚Äôs what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game:¬†
It looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don‚Äôt have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.¬†

                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2022/06/12/d4d89ed0/scorn.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today‚Äôs Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.
Drawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.
The new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.
Ebb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.
The developers are also touting the game‚Äôs focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.
While the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I‚Äôm eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.
Scorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.</span>

In the trailer, we see the pilotable mech farming around its new, strange world ‚Äì growing crops, building structures, and generally exploring the surroundings. The trailer ends on a mysterious discovery, though as you might expect, does little to show what that may be.¬†
Check it out in the trailer below:


According to Lightyear Frontier&#x27;s Steam page:
&quot;Lightyear Frontier is a peaceful open-world farming adventure on a planet at the far edge of the galaxy. Start your new home on a distant planet with up to three friends as you farm alien crops, build your own homestead, and explore the untamed wilderness of the world.&quot;

Lightyear Frontier will be released into Early Access next spring on Xbox consoles and PC. According to the trailer, it&#x27;s a console launch exclusive.</span>

                              <span>6/12 UPDATE:¬†
As we previously reported below, a leak heavily hinted that Forza Horizon 5&#x27;s first expansion would be a Hot Wheels crossover. Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed¬†trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we&#x27;ve come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19.¬†
PREVIOUS STORY
According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5‚Äôs first expansion ‚Äì a Hot Wheels crossover ‚Äì leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below.¬†
This wouldn‚Äôt be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone‚Äôs guess.¬†
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer‚Äôs Top 10 Games of 2021 list:¬†
‚ÄúTo merely¬†say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it‚Äôs the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.‚Äù
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment showed up strong to the Xbox and Bethesda¬†showcase with a new look at Overwatch 2. The publisher had plenty to show from the hero shooter, including a new character and the announcement of the day it&#x27;ll enter¬†Early Access, October 4.


When it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2&#x27;s PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It&#x27;ll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her¬†Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match¬†against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We&#x27;ll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.
Blizzard¬†promises¬†regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn&#x27;t mean the information above isn&#x27;t any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch,¬†and PC at the same time.</span>

Today&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase gave us an advanced look at this 2023 action/RPG, showing off traversal, combat, boss fights, and more.¬†
In many sequences, we see Nor and Enki in the middle of vast battlefields, using a variety of weapons and magics to dispose of any soldier or beast that stands in their way. The footage is impressive, both in scale and the level of detail in the worlds. Nor and Enki appear to have swift aerial traversal means to get across terrain quickly.

                              <span>Pete Hines took the stage at today&#x27;s Xbox¬†Showcase to introduce a bevy of Bethesda projects. Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company&#x27;s online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game&#x27;s world. However, this is the first update we&#x27;ve had for¬†the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.
The Pitt&#x27;s story will take place in¬†post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven&#x27;t seen since Fallout 3. Described as &quot;a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict,&quot; players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt&#x27;s toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants.¬†


Fallout 76&#x27;s Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Mojang have revealed Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game coming to Xbox consoles and PC.¬†
This news comes from today‚Äôs Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, where Mojang revealed the Legends trailer. The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player.¬†
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below:¬†


As you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang‚Äôs blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.
It retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don‚Äôt have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year.¬†

                              <span>Amicia and Hugo want to start a new life, but they need to find somewhere safe where this dream can be realized. In a new trailer for Asobo Studio&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Requiem, we see them traveling south, across treacherous terrain and into thriving villages. These places look like they could be safe havens, but we quickly see guards expanding their search and are everywhere.
The new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.
Of course, Hugo&#x27;s curse doesn&#x27;t remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe. A Plague Tale: Requiem still doesn&#x27;t have an official release date, but is still slated to release in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Early in today‚Äôs Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games‚Äô president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot‚Äôs biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.
First, Riot‚Äôs flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.
In League of Legends: Wild Rift, it‚Äôs a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.
In Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that‚Äôs the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.
In Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.
And in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.
It‚Äôs a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox‚Äôs benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.
While Riot‚Äôs expansion into Game Pass is big news, it‚Äôs worth noting that it won‚Äôt have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.
The availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.</span>

                              <span>The highly anticipated Hollow Knight sequel, Silksong, appeared at the Xbox Games Showcase with a snazzy new trailer, but the biggest news is it will be playable day one on Xbox Game Pass.
Announced back in 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong takes place in a haunted kingdom swarming with bugs. As insectoid creature Hornet, your weapon of choice is a needle. The gameplay is said to be largely similar to its predecessor, but with an increased focus on speed. The latest trailer showed off more of what to expect, with¬†an impressive showing of the¬†striking art style, swift platforming, and unique baddies. You can watch the trailer above to see what I mean.¬†
No release date was revealed for the Xbox and PC versions.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios have revealed Forza Motorsport (that‚Äôs right ‚Äì there‚Äôs no number attached to this entry in the franchise) with a beautiful trailer.¬†
Revealed during today‚Äôs Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, Turn 10‚Äôs latest motorsport game will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in spring of next year. The studio calls it the ‚Äúmost technologically advanced racing game ever made.‚Äù To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.
Check out the reveal trailer for yourself below:¬†


Not to be confused with Playground Games‚Äô Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there‚Äôs plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race.¬†
Check out this demo trailer for more information about that:¬†


All of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more. That includes the car damage your vehicle will endure when you hit other drivers or barriers on the track, too.¬†

                              <span>Squanch Games has announced High On Life, a new first-person shooter from the mind of Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland.¬†
Squanch Games revealed High On Life during today‚Äôs Xbox gaming showcase, and the first trailer for it highlights talking guns, alien cartels, and plenty of Roiland-style humor. It‚Äôs appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don‚Äôt have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year.¬†
‚ÄúAfter a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,‚Äù a press release reads. ‚ÄúThe alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.
‚Äú[Defeating] powerful aliens isn‚Äôt going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù¬†

Squanch Games‚Äô studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland‚Äôs comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio‚Äôs other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it‚Äôs a Squanch game.¬†
‚ÄúI wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,‚Äù Roiland writes in a press release. ‚ÄúThen we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we‚Äôre on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.‚Äù¬†

                              <span>Arkane Studio‚Äôs Redfall kicked off the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with the first extended gameplay trailer.
The trailer sets the table for the adventure, which unfolds on the island of Redfall, Massachusetts. The idyllic town falls apart when residents disappear and, worse, become vampires. If that‚Äôs not enough, some survivors have taken to worshipping these night creatures as deranged cultists. Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact.¬†


The¬†crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne.¬†
Redfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.</span>

While still seeing some reported use today, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the quality of the VMEbus Linux support. After the VME subsystem was promoted out of staging a decade ago, the VME hardware drivers failed to ever leave staging and the code has fallen into disrepair and no maintenance now for the past half-decade. So the VME subsystem support is preparing to depart back to the land of the kernel&#x27;s staging area...</span>

The patches help ensure AMX-enabled CPUs can reach their lower power states for maximum power-savings and that also helps ensure other CPU cores have a larger thermal/power budget for hitting their rated turbo frequencies.

                              <span>Sci-fi platformer Planet Of Lana seems like a sweet, scenic adventure with an alien monkey butler, and today‚Äôs Future Games Show had a little more gameplay to share. I mentioned Planet Of Lana earlier this week in my Day Of The Devs 2022 round-up, because it featured in that indie showcase too. Check out the trailer if you missed it on Thursday, it‚Äôs quite charming.

                              <span>Last year a couple of brothers posted a concept trailer for an FPS horror game that didn&#x27;t exist (named Project Ill). Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I&#x27;ve not got much to point you towards - there&#x27;s no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.

                              <span>Palworld has a new trailer. If you&#x27;ve seen Palworld&#x27;s previous two trailers, those words alone should send you rushing below to see what new absurdity is on show. For the uninitiated: Palworld is a game in which you can catch off-brand Pok√©mon, put them to work in a sweatshop producing guns, and then do battle with these Nop√©mon by your side and and an assault rifle in your hands.

Watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll see.

Cai, developer of The Cartomancy Anthology, as part of his efforts to dig into the mystery of why tarot is such a popular inspiration for indie games at the moment. Happily, after today&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, we can provide you with a little update on that story: Cai&#x27;s expansive collaborative project is due to release on Steam very soon: on August 9th, 2022.

                              <span>Tinykin is about an astronaut named Milo returning to earth after a long space voyage. Milo might reasonably fall to his knees and scream &quot;You blew it up, damn you!&quot; when he gets there, because the earth he lands upon has been blown up several times larger than normal - either that or he&#x27;s been made much smaller and is now the size of a penny. Milo must then have to navigate the abandoned world with a Pikmin-like army of aliens by his side, ready to solve puzzles. 

It looks great, and after being announced last year, Tinykin now has a release date of August 30th.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned from today&#x27;s Future Of Play event, it&#x27;s that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it&#x27;s at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an &quot;Indigenous cybernoir detective game&quot; and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe &quot;in the works&quot; isn&#x27;t quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.
The trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s ‚Äî complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It&#x27;s not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years&#x27; time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it&#x27;s riddled with &quot;crime, conflict, and propaganda&quot;. Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.

                              <span>Anyone up for side-scrolling Bloodborne? That‚Äôs the distinct vibe emitting from every gothic orifice of The Last Faith, a Metroidvania coming this year. Some more footage of the thwack ‚Äòem up platformer was shown off at today‚Äôs Future Games Show. You can stroke your beard and make approving sounds at it, if you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sunday Gold, revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, has a lot going on under the hood, so bear with me. In Sunday Gold you play a team of three crims and... well, I can&#x27;t explain it better than the steam blurb, which says &quot;experience a unique hybrid of escape room style puzzles, turn-based combat, and RPG mechanics tied together with a dark and cinematic storyline.&quot; So, er, Blending a few things, here. Key takeaway is that everyone in this has a faced like a slapped Bulldog&#x27;s bum. Nobody is having a fun time.

                              <span>Bramble: The Mountain King is an action-adventure game inspired by grim Nordic folktales, where the bosses you&#x27;ll encounter may have some horrible backstory which explains why they now drown people for funsies. It&#x27;s also seemingly a game where you&#x27;re a wee smout and can ride on the back of a friendly hedgehog. There&#x27;s a new trailer which covers both of these elements below.

                              <span>I adore Deadly Premonition, a game which shines despite substantial elements being janky or bad. The 2010 horror game about an oddball FBI agent investigating ritual murders in small-town America is not &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot;, it&#x27;s so good it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s bad (and maybe the badness even amplifies the good). Well, I&#x27;ve been playing Deadly Premonition 2 ahead of its PC release today, and I&#x27;m sorry to say the sequel does not shake out the same way. Despite some bright spots, enough of Deadly Premonition 2 is bad that I&#x27;ve given up.

In the former we got a bit of a primer on Tove Jansson&#x27;s work as the source material for this game, but in the latter we got a better look at the game in motion - plus news that ethereal Icelandic rockers Sigur R√≥s are collaborating on the sound track.

                              <span>One of the most intriguing new announcements at today&#x27;s Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you&#x27;ll be on the right lines.
The trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma&#x27;s whole retro futuristic vibe. It&#x27;s got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the &#x27;90s, which of course means that it&#x27;s much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.

                              <span>Revealed at the Future Games Show tonight, Tray Racers is a game clearly derived from a dev accidentally doing a spoonerism in a meeting one time. This SEO nightmare is being developed by Bit Loom, the team behind colourful yet somehow unsettling puzzle game Phogs, and it&#x27;s about racing down sand dunes on trays. As the trailer says, &quot;the world ended... But the fun didn‚Äôt!&quot;, and I guess winning a dune race would take your mind off the unending horror for a bit.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard not to view Kitfox Games as the stars of tonight&#x27;s Future Of Play event. Hot on the heels of the news that Boyfriend Dungeon will be receiving a substantial free update, they unveiled Mossfield Origins, the next game coming courtesy of their publishing arm.
Developed by Studio Any Percent, Mossfield Origins promises an extremely relaxing take on the sci-fi city builder genre. The announcement trailer, which you can check out below, opens with a serene disembodied voice setting the tone for what&#x27;s to come. &quot;We were sent here with a purpose,&quot; the voice murmurs soothingly, then adds: &quot;But we&#x27;re not doing that any more.&quot;

You think I can slow time to infinity when I need it? So I&#x27;ve done you a little roundup of the games that caught my eye this time. There&#x27;s some action, some horror and some puzzles.

Consequently I&#x27;m a fan of horror anthologies in the vein of No Code&#x27;s Stories Untold. Upcoming freak &#x27;em up The Fridge Is Red (developed by 5Word Team) looks like r/nosleep having a story jam about the fridge you have to stare at off of Control, so I&#x27;m into it. Look out for it in 2022, but the trailer says there&#x27;s a free demo on Steam now.

                              <span>2017&#x27;s Serial Cleaner was all about stealthfully infiltrating a murder scene¬†and cleaning up the mess before the cops got their hands on any evidence. Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.


Unlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino&#x27;s body of work and other¬†classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can&#x27;t let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners&#x27; street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.
If you&#x27;re ready to aid¬†and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.
As Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.
Beyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.
Beyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you‚Äôve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.
As Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.
Arctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.</span>

                              <span>50-year-old Frenchman Max Louarn began his hacking career in the 80s and during the following decades built up quite a reputation. He earned millions of dollars and traveled the world, but also spent time in prison. Despite being wanted by the FBI for his alleged involvement with Nintendo hacking group Team Xecuter, Louarn doesn&#x27;t view himself as a criminal, but as a rebel instead.

                              <span>Guns and swords are a useful combination, so imagine having a gat-toting frog riding on top of a blade-wielding robot. That‚Äôs essentially the cut and thrust of Moving Pictures Interactive‚Äôs roguelite co-op action adventure Shoulders Of Giants, coming to the Epic Games Store later this year. They‚Äôre not quite a 21st century Banjo-Kazooie, but they‚Äôll do in a pinch.

                              <span>What is building a PC but piecing together an elaborate, electronic jigsaw? Equally, what is building a jigsaw but piecing together an analogue cardboard PC you can&#x27;t do anything with after it&#x27;s finished? These similarities are why building a PC isn&#x27;t as strange a subject for a videogame as it first appears.

If you like your electric jigsaws, then good news: there&#x27;s now an open beta available for PC Building Simulator 2.

                              <span>Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I&#x27;ll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I&#x27;ve spent most of this week chasing answers, and I&#x27;ve come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: ¬£46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

                              <span>One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;No way. Not a chance. I wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot; People were shocked at my refusal. &quot;But nothing will go wrong!&quot; they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they&#x27;ve played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

Quick-witted on a good day, an absolute dunderhead on a bad one. Here&#x27;s a list of the 7 best AI in PC games.

                              <span>Skate Story has been grinding along for a couple of years, promising a skateboarding game set in an ephemeral world of ghostly corridors and unending paths. The last we saw of it was back in 2020. It resurfaced tonight during Devolver&#x27;s not-E3 showcase, and dang: it&#x27;s transformed into one of the most beautiful games I&#x27;ve ever seen.

                              <span>Anger Foot. It‚Äôs angry and there are certainly plenty of feet. From Free Lives, the creators of Broforce and Genital Jousting, it‚Äôs so aggressively kicky that I don‚Äôt feel like going near doors anytime soon. They describe it as a ‚Äúlightning fast hard bass blast of kicking down doors and kicking ass‚Äù. Good grief. Keep an eye on the threatening tootsies in the trailer below.

                              <span>I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it&#x27;s a JRPG and I dislike those. It&#x27;s got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it&#x27;s got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you&#x27;ll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it&#x27;s got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

                              <span>Successful lawsuits filed by several Israel-based media companies against three pirate streaming sites are proving tricky to wrap up. A US court previously issued orders for all ISPs to block the sites and instructed third-party service providers to cease doing business with them. The plaintiffs say that since Cloudflare is refusing to comply, the company should be held in contempt of court.

                              <span>New research published by the EU Intellectual Property Office shows that piracy remains prevalent among EU youth. The lack of affordable content is most often cited as motivation. Interestingly, piracy rates among university-educated respondents are almost double that of those who enjoyed little to no schooling.

They include a suggestion to add &quot;VPN detection&quot; tools to prevent people from engaging in &quot;geo-piracy&quot;. This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

The first of its kind in Canada, the flexible injunction was obtained by companies including Rogers, Bell, The Sports Network, and Groupe TVA. Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

                              <span>Hosting provider LeaseWeb is being sued for copyright infringement at a federal court in California. The lawsuit was filed by photographer Barry Rosen who argues that Leaseweb failed to take action against &quot;infringing&quot; poster sites, despite receiving repeated DMCA notices. The owners of the infringing sites are unknown and listed as Doe defendants.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it‚Äôs release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you‚Äôll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we‚Äôve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks ‚Äì and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success ‚Äì together!
