                              <span>DC Fandome, the virtual fan convention showcasing DC movies, TV shows, and, of course, video games, will not take place this year, Warner Bros. Discovery confirms. 
The first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. 
In a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:
Fandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year&#x27;s show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). 
While we won&#x27;t see them during DC&#x27;s big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red has revealed that it will air a special episode of Night City Wire next week to discuss what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077 and its upcoming anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
For the uninitiated, Night City Wire is basically like CDPR&#x27;s version of a Nintendo Direct, except the showcases are specifically focused on Cyberpunk 2077. They were quite prevalent in the leadup to the release of Cyberpunk 2077, but now, with it nearing two years old, Night City Wire has grown to be rarer. The next one airs on Sept. 6 at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET, though, and will be &quot;about our upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077.&quot;
Choooom! There&#x27;s something new on the horizon – a special episode of Night City Wire!
#Edgerunners and what&#x27;s next for #Cyberpunk2077. 🔥

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new Hogwarts Legacy featurette that dives deep into the design of the titular school. It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. 
This new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. 
Check out the featurette for yourself below: 


As you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. 
What’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: 

For more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy. Watch this Hogwarts Legacy trailer from last week that showcases unforgivable curses and Sebastian Sallow’s Dark Legacy questline after that.

There&#x27;s more news to share about Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt Red is airing a new Night City Wire, its Cyberpunk 2077 update stream, on September 6.
The new Night City Wire will air on CD Projekt Red&#x27;s Twitch channel on September 6 at 5 p.m. CEST. For U.S. viewers, that will be at 11 a.m. ET / 8 a.m. PT.

As for what we can expect to see? CD Projekt Red says it will be talking about the upcoming anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. The Netflix series is a collaboration with Kill la Kill animation house Studio Trigger, and debuts on September 13. It also just got a very NSFW trailer and hey, it looks neat.
The developer also says it will talk about what&#x27;s next for Cyberpunk 2077. That&#x27;s a bit intriguing. W…</span>

                              <span>Step 1: Go Fast - Step 2: Actually understand what you&#x27;re buying
The initial rollout of Sonic Frontiers information was messy, to say the least. After a series of confusing videos that didn&#x27;t exactly showcase the game in the best light, we finally got a look at Cyber Space, and a glimpse into the narrative. This Sonic Frontiers overview trailer (which re-iterates the November 8 release date) basically compiles all of that into one digestible package.
Clocking in at roughly three minutes, this new video from the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube account is actually pretty helpful! It starts at the literal beginning, with Sonic, Amy, and Tails chilling, before they&#x27;re &quot;sucked into a dimensional portal to Cyber Space, then ends up on the Starfall Islands.&quot; It then moves into a mechanical perspective, talking up its open world (which it calls &quot;open-zone platforming&quot;) and &quot;the freedom to play the game in the order that matches your playstyle.&quot; A slight overview of the combat system and in-game puzzles are also touched on.
There&#x27;s also a crucial part that actually talks about how critical path story progress is made. You&#x27;ll defeat bosses to earn &quot;Portal Gears,&quot; which in turn unlock Cyber Space stages. Once you finish challenges therein, you&#x27;ll then earn keys that can be used to unlock Chaos Emerald vaults to &quot;progress farther in the game.&quot; That seems to be the loop!
Hopefully that can last for —I&#x27;m going to guess — 10-15 hours, and beyond? Either way, they should have led with some of these videos (especially Cyber Space) out of the gate.

                              <span>Unearthed Treasure
Tokyo Game Show is yet to officially get underway, but already it seems that some of its surprises are just too durn exciting to keep under wraps — According to a new leak uncovered by Gematsu, legendary shmup developer Treasure is getting set to reveal a new project under the banner of one of its best-loved IPs, Radiant Silvergun.
Gematsu found evidence of a new Radiant Silvergun title after poking around the TGS website uploaded by publisher Happinet. Alongside assets and titles pulled from over 30 franchises was a brand new logo simply depicting &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, complete with a silhouette of the game&#x27;s iconic starship. Treasure, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, will apparently be showcasing the new title at this year&#x27;s TGS, which will no doubt get retro game fans and shmup aficionados into a suitable tizzy.
Radiant Silvergun was released in Japanese arcades in May 1998, before finding its way onto the Sega Saturn in the console&#x27;s twilight years. For the longest of times, it would remain something of an urban legend among western players, available only via expensive imports and poor early-day emulation. The classy shmup would eventually be ported to Xbox 360 in 2011, which represented the title&#x27;s first, readily available, global release. Today, Radiant Silvergun still stands proud, holding a deserved reputation as a genuine classic of the genre.
What form this project will take remains to be seen, but I would think a remaster or remake is more likely than a sequel. In either case, we won&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to find out, as Tokyo Game Show will kick off September 15, emanating from Chiba&#x27;s Makuhari Messe complex. We will bring you all of the details from Radiant Silvergun (and many other TGS exclusives) right here on Destructoid.

Mario Kart Tour gacha is no more, at least come &quot;late September,&quot; according to a new update from the game&#x27;s official Twitter account.
Here&#x27;s the full rundown:
&quot;Here&#x27;s a peek at #MarioKartTour&#x27;s update coming late September! Battle mode will be added, along with a Spotlight Shop, where you can exchange rubies for drivers, karts, and gliders! Also, pipes you can fire by using rubies will be removed. See the notification for details.&quot;

So checking out that notification on the app, it seems as if &quot;new drivers, karts, and gliders, as well as drivers, karts, and gliders that have appeared in the past, will be available.&quot; This &quot;Spotlight Shop&quot; system will likely work similarly to the Fornite (and company) spotlight shops, which only showcase a few things to buy at a time: in a bid to get you to keep checking out the storefront and buy something before it leaves. The in-game update also says &quot;lots of other things are in the works too.&quot;
Obviously, a lot of games still have gacha elements, and clearly (in addition to this primarily being a business decision rather than some gift on high) this helps Nintendo enter into markets that don&#x27;t currently allow it. But for folks who didn&#x27;t like the gambling element of Mario Kart Tour gacha, it&#x27;s a win.

A bundle of trouble is headed to Warner Bros Games crossover fighter MultiVersus in just a few short days, as developer Player First Games has dropped a new teaser trailer that points to the arrival of Gizmo, the heroic little Mogwai from Joe Dante&#x27;s 1984 hit, Gremlins.
A short teaser video sees the ancient, ornate chest that is Gizmo&#x27;s home open up in response to the sound of cavorting mayhem, suggesting that the sweet lol&#x27; fuzzball is headed to MultiVersus in order to keep his arch nemesis, Stripe, in line. While details on Gizmo are very sparse at the time of writing, it is believed that he will be an individual character from Stripe, with his own moveset and abilities.

Unconventional controllers are one of my favorite gaming content niches. They&#x27;re something I&#x27;ve enjoyed out of the corner of my eye for years, with my personal favorite being Rudeism&#x27;s full-body goose costume/controller to play Untitled Goose Game. The Twitch streamers are back at it again, but this time the spotlight is on an Elden Ring streamer MissMakkaa, and her build that uses a dance pad peripheral as a controller.
Basically, she got one of those at-home dance pads you use for games like Dance Dance Revolution and hooked it up to Elden Ring, which is already a funny enough concept on its own. What&#x27;s even more impressive, then, is that she&#x27;s already beaten five of the game&#x27;s bosses to date (thanks, Eurogamer), and she isn&#x27;t stopping there.

As a 3D platformer fan who loves scooping up collectibles, Tinykin is such a breezy time.
Playing as a shrunken explorer in a gigantic bedroom with insect citizens just living their lives, you&#x27;re constantly on the lookout for glowing bits of pollen to collect and new (Pikmin-like) tinykin creatures to command. For folks like me, it feels like a continuous brain massage. The game&#x27;s sense of progression is so fast, you&#x27;re usually just seconds away from finding something to pick up. It maintains this pace the whole way through its six-hour run. That is until you start nudging your way toward 100 percent completion.
Without spoiling anything, Tinykin has two main collectibles — pollen and tinykin — and there isn&#x27;t a radar or ability to help sn…</span>

The acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft is still under scrutiny by regulators. Today we got a glimpse of what the deal might entail if it goes through, as series like Call of Duty could wind up on Game Pass.
Xbox head Phil Spencer writes in a new blog today that Microsoft intends to bring Activision Blizzard&#x27;s library of games onto Game Pass. This includes, specifically, titles like Overwatch, Diablo, and Call of Duty.
This does not, though, preclude a game like Call of Duty from hitting PlayStation platforms. Spencer has previously stated that Microsoft does not intend to &quot;pull communities away from that platform&quot; if the deal goes through.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.
But after watching and absorbing one of the game&#x27;s early missions, I can genuinely say that I&#x27;d be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I&#x27;d genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.

                              <span>Oh my goodness, what a creepy, funny, and odd game Northern Journey is. I almost don&#x27;t want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.
To call Northern Journey &quot;retro&quot; would completely misrepresent it. It&#x27;s beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It&#x27;s translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It&#x27;s a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It&#x27;s vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I&#x27;m so glad I got to play it.

                              <span>Real-time tactics game Men Of War 2 has been pushed to 2023 to incorporate more features and content sparked by feedback from closed playtests. Developers Best Way and publishers Fulqrum say the impact of having to pause development because of the outbreak of war in Best Way’s home country of Ukraine has led them to take extra time on the game for these to be implemented. Watch the latest trailer below.

                              <span>So two weeks ago I let you know that Vampire Survivors wouldn’t be getting any more patches before it launched into its 1.0 version. The cheeky scamps at poncle have only gone and made me look like a right sausage today, surprise announcing another patch. This time, they’re adding in a new game mode, quick start, and a very odd new character.

                              <span>Another indie developer has come forward publicly with allegations that UK-based publishers PQube have withheld money from them. Thai dev team Corecell claim they’ve only seen some of the minimum guaranteed money agreed when they signed the European console publishing rights to their action-puzzle game AeternoBlade 2 over to PQube in 2019. 

Corecell say they attempted to resolve things with PQube but that didn’t work, and they had to terminate the publishing agreement in 2020. Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail. Corecell allege that PQube did offer to return the rights to the game, but only if they would agree to keep the situation secret.

                              <span>Statistically, there’s a good chance you clicked onto this page with a Logitech G502 mouse. Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.


There’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action. Does it deserve to?

                              <span>First impressions can be interesting. I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.


Ventura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.

Gizmo is the original source of the gremlins, and the sweetest character from the movies, but you still wouldn’t want to mess with the little fellow. He’ll arrive on Tuesday, ahead of the already announced Stripe, Gremlins&#x27; big (small) bad.

Now one unofficial Flash Player emulator is adding support for more classic games, ones made in the (relatively) newfangled ActionScript 3 language.

                              <span>Inti Creates have earned themselves a reputation in recent years, through titles like Blaster Master Zero and the Azure Striker Gunvolt series, of creating visually-intricate and technical 2D platformers. Their games scratch the nostalgic itch while not reverting to the technical problems and gameplay hurdles that we’ve long since moved beyond. Part of what makes Gunvolt appealing is that it refines and expands upon a formula we see in the Mega Man X series, and it’s a similar intent that defines the company’s approach to their latest project, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge.

                              <span>Halo series stewards 343 Industries have given a rather sombre update on the state of Halo Infinite’s future, and there’s a lot of delays and cancellations. The game’s campaign network co-op, season 3 of multiplayer, and Forge mode have been pushed back, and couch co-op outright cancelled. And if there’s one thing about Halo that you don’t mess with then it would seem that’s couch co-op.

All we know for sure so far is that the game exists, it’s definitely called Mirage, and returns to the Middle Eastern setting of the original Assassin’s Creed. I rather like the blue highlights to the assassin’s robes in this one.

                              <span>As indie developers from Japan and around the world descended upon the former Japanese capital of Kyoto for Bitsummit 2022, some developers present at the event were showcasing their games a little closer to home. Having already been hyped up amongst Japanese games outlets for its unique visuals and inspirations from Japanese yokai and folk tales, Kitsune: The Journey Of Adashino was a rather hot ticket at the event, and with an English localisation and a release in 2023 or 2024 planned, it stands with the opportunity to shine a light on the Japanese indie gaming scene.


While it may perhaps be reductive to make a Studio Ghibli comparison to the game’s opening moments, the familiarity many have with those films compared to Japanese folklore makes the equivalence an easy one. My time with the demo was from a moment early in the game, when you’ve already set foot into this new world but don&#x27;t have much knowledge about the yokai-infested supernatural surprises that await you.

Phil Summers, the artist behind &#x27;Hand-Drawn Game Guides&#x27;, is venturing into the world of print game magazines. Dubbed &#x27;Hand-Drawn Gaming&#x27;, the magazine will be a bi-monthly release consisting of 8 pages; not a huge amount, you might think, but the great thing about this, of course, is that the entire thing will be crafted by hand, much like the aforementioned game guides Summers has created in previous years.

What&#x27;s dark, bitter, and makes you poop? That&#x27;s right! It&#x27;s death! But also, coffee. Finally, the two have been brought together at last in Necrobarista, an anime-inspired cinematic visual novel where the dead are allowed one last cuppa before being punted into the great beyond.
Set in Melbourne — the Australian city that loves its coffee so much that they keep inventing new ones — Necrobarista combines a diverse cast of characters with gorgeous music and plenty of discussion of beans, roasts, and what happens after you die.

                              <span>The city that nevers sleeps.
These days, it feels like deckbuilding elements are finding their way into all kinds of roguelikes, but it’s not too often that you see new releases purely built around card games. City Wars: Tokyo Reign is one of those rare releases, and we’re pleased to report that it presents an interesting and unique take on CCG gameplay. There may be some minor rough edges to the experience, but it overall manages to provide an addictive and engrossing experience fans of card games won’t want to miss.
The cyberpunk narrative here plays second fiddle to the mechanics as you fight your way through a series of procedurally generated city districts to defeat ne&#x27;er-do-wells and reign supreme. Battles play out across a two-phase setup, alternating endlessly between the two until either you or your opponent dies. The first phase has each of you taking a few turns to lay cards out on your respective sides of the track, while the second phase consists of chronologically executing the effects of those cards. Each tick on the track represents one unit of time, and cards with a higher ‘duration’ will thus take up more ticks. Cards placed the farthest to the left will be the ones that are played first, so before you’re even considering any of the stats or effects of a card, you first need to consider both where you can fit it on the track and how early or late you want it to activate in the execution phase.

Initially announced back in May, Blaze Entertainment&#x27;s Evercade EXP looks like a natural progression of its original Evercade handheld, showcasing a streamlined design with a solid glass-covered 800x480 pixel 4.3-inch IPS screen and built-in Wi-Fi for firmware updates, along with a USB-C port and improved 1.5Ghz chipset.
Our friends over at Time Extension have managed to go hands-on with the new Evercade EXP and came away feeling immensely positive about the upcoming launch later this year. During the session, it was also confirmed by Blaze that the handheld will come bundled with 18 classic Capcom games - a handful of which have appeared on the likes of the NES and SNES - making a prospective purchase all the more tempting for Evercade fans and newcomers.

If you&#x27;ve not heard of the Mobile Game Boy Adapter, we don&#x27;t blame you. This Japan-only Game Boy peripheral can connect to a Japanese mobile phone and play certain Game Boy games online. They didn&#x27;t sell very well back in the day, but trust fans to track this peripheral down to find an unusual way of using it. And, a security researcher has managed to use the adapter and Pokémon Crystal to take control of an opponent&#x27;s Game Boy remotely.
In a chat with Vice&#x27;s tech column Motherboard, Xcellerator shared his fascination with retro tech. So, with the annual Binary Golf Grand Prix — a competition to find &quot;the smallest file which will crash a specific program&quot; — Xcellerator wanted to use this adapter in his entry. Instead, what he ended up discovering was what he thinks is the very first case of &#x27;remote code execution&#x27; (a hack where you can run any kind of code on a target device) using a Game Boy Color.

In celebration of GoldenEye 007&#x27;s 25th anniversary last month, a diehard Mario fan, known on YouTube as StupidMarioBros1Fan, sought to remake the game with Super Mario 64 characters at the helm. The result was fantastic — in a kind of deeply horrifying way — and the team has now dropped an update to the PC fan game which includes two new custom levels, an updated Peach&#x27;s Castle design, and dialogue changes.
Shared on Twitter by GoldenEye world champion, @Graslu00, the playthrough video shows how the developers have transferred the title&#x27;s signature gameplay into the Mario 64 level format. This time, instead of jumping on your enemies, you will have to contend with grenade-throwing Bob-ombs (presumably the equivalent to a human throwing a baby) and Koopas with machine guns. When we heard that the Mario movie would start shooting soon, this isn&#x27;t what we expected.

                              <span>An in-game shop will be implemented.
Nintendo has announced a handful of new updates coming to its mobile racing game, Mario Kart Tour, throughout September. But one big change — coming in October — is that the game will no longer have gacha elements, instead opting for what it&#x27;s calling a &#x27;Spotlight Shop&#x27;.
If you&#x27;ve ever used a capsule toy machine or a gachapon machine, then you have a pretty good idea of what gacha games are like. They entice you to spend in-game currency — which you can either earn by playing the game or get by spending real money — to buy random in-game items. Popular games that use gacha include Genshin Impact, Dragalia Lost (which is sadly closing down in November), Fire Emblem Heroes (which is Nintendo&#x27;s most-popular mobile game) and Pokémon Masters EX.

Bandai Namco&#x27;s Pac-Man World: Re-Pac has been a blast from the past for those of us that had a PlayStation growing up. So imagine being one of the people who worked on the original game, seeing all of your work on-screen, prettied up and refined — it&#x27;s likely exciting! But for former Namco Hometek game designer Scott Rogers, he was only met with disappointment when he reached the end of the remake to find that he — and the rest of the team on the original — hadn&#x27;t been credited.
Speaking to our friends over at Time Extension, Rogers said that crediting the original staff should be a &quot;courtesy&quot;. Rogers also told Jason Weesner and Hardy LeBel — who also worked on the team — of this, and expressed his frustration, because crediting the original staff is &quot;just the decent thing to do, right?&quot;

Skateboarding games have had a resurgence in recent years, and it seems the Nintendo Switch could be getting one more in the near future.
Yet another rating has popped up, this time in Taiwan. As highlighted by Universo Nintendo (via GoNintendo), it&#x27;s Session: Skate Sim.

Sonic 2022 has a nice ring to it (ha), but according to Sonic producer Takashi Iizuka (who has worked on the series since Sonic 3), this year will be the &quot;biggest year&quot; for the character to date.
Speaking to Twinfinite, Iizuka elaborates on his claim:
&quot;We believe that 2022 is going to be the biggest year for Sonic. We have a lot of great things that we’ve done this year and a lot of great things for the future as well. The success of movie two has been really amazing and it really brought a lot of people into the audience. So we thank everyone for enjoying movie two. We had the release of Sonic Origins right after that. We have the release of Sonic Frontiers coming up on November 8, and we also have the Netflix TV show, Sonic Prime, coming up this winter.&quot;

&quot;The Netflix show&quot; is none other than Sonic Prime, which is rumored to be out in December of this year (and the whole &quot;winter&quot; statement helps reconfirm that). That short list above also doesn&#x27;t account for some other Sonic-related happenings, so let&#x27;s recap them below.
What does 2022 have in store for Sonic?
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (movie)
Sonic Origins
Sonic Frontiers
Sonic Prime (TV show)
Updates for Sonic Forces and Sonic Dash mobile, which are still in operation
More Sonic collabs in games like Roblox and Fall Guys
More merch collabs
Another Sonic Symphony concert in October
From a broader perspective, I can easily see what he&#x27;s saying. Sonic Origins didn&#x27;t have the best launch, and Frontiers really has an uphill battle to prove itself, especially after Forces. But if you count the wide success of the Sonic 2 film and add in a major Netflix series on the way, things get a little more exciting for Sonic fans as a whole.

                              <span>Oh, crap. I&#x27;m in a house again
I’m always down for some sleazy horror. Okay, maybe not the film kind, since I’m not much of a movie buff, but this new trend of short-form slasher games with VHS filters and PS1 graphics I’m all about. Deadly Night by Cubyte Games is that. It is definitely that.

Deadly Night (PC)
Developer: Cubyte Games
Publisher: Torture Star Video
Released: September 2, 2022
MSRP: TBA

Deadly Night follows Carol after she’s dropped off at a motel. I’m sure it isn’t difficult to guess that she’s in for a bad time. What is interesting is that you have some control over what kind of bad time you have. Regardless of what you choose, though, Carol eventually winds up in the basement of a creepy house. It’s one of those horror stories. The creepy house story. And, of course, th…</span>

More Kirby icons are now live for Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Online reward system, with a new suite from Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet.
As you may recall, Dream Buffet dropped in a low-key manner a few weeks ago for $15 on the eShop. Given the relatively short amount of time from its announcement to launch, a lot of folks were confused as to what the game even was and/or if it was free-to-play. Much to the delight of many, it ended up being a fully premium game with no microtransactions, and a host of unlocks. If the online functionality is shored up, it could become even more enticing as a longer-term party game.
Either way, the Dream Buffet subseries is now in full swing, and these Switch icons prove it. While they&#x27;re mostly Kirby (the character) related, they&#x27;re also showing off multiple iterations of the Puffball, akin to all the alternate versions of Yoshi in games like Mario RPG or Yoshi&#x27;s Island/Super Mario World. On top of that, you can pick up Dream Buffet&#x27;s version of an item block (like Mario Party), as well as an icon for Elfilin from Kirby and the Forgotten Land. You can pick them up from now through September 6 at 6PM PT.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>Naughty but NIS
With Tokyo Game Show 2022 bearing down on us, publishers on both sides of the Pacific are preparing to drop a fresh round of updates and reveals from their upcoming catalogs. NIS America is the latest to tease an upcoming showcase, which will take place on the morning of Wednesday, September 7.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MuokBsXyLSI
While the publisher did not drop any hints as to which titles and localization it will bring to the party, we can expect to see no less than four new game announcements. NIS America is obviously notable for its standard practice of localizing Japanese releases and bundling together classic JRPGs for modern platforms. But we&#x27;ll simply have to wait and see what the publisher has up its sleeve for 2023.
The NIS America Showcase will premiere on the official NIS America YouTube channel, on September 7, at 08:00 PT / 11:00 ET / 16:00 BST. The stream will be followed by an aftershow, which will feature chats with developers, as well as a competition to win a one-of-a-kind artwork reproduction taken from one of the day&#x27;s revealed titles. We will, as always, bring you all of the exciting details right here on Destructoid.
NIS America&#x27;s next release is the compendium Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol 3, which compiles the quirky releases La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure. It launches on Nintendo Switch tomorrow.

                              <span>They&#x27;re out in Free Title Update 2
More Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak quality of life updates are on the way, according to a new tweet from Capcom.
The tweets showcase a change to shortcut loadouts, which will increase the threshold of the mechanic to eight slots in all. We&#x27;ll also be getting a long-awaited &quot;lock&quot; mechanic, which will let you sidestep accidentally selling or crafting armor pieces you don&#x27;t want to get rid of. This has been a thing for many years in many high-profile games with inventory management, and it&#x27;s very much welcome with Rise.
Note that this is all coming in the next major Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak update. Title Update 2 will arrive in &quot;late September,&quot; and we&#x27;ll likely get full confirmation soon, including a stream to show it off. Capcom has been running a thankfully predictable and effective hype campaign for these updates.
As a reminder, Title Update 1 already arrived on August 10 on both PC and Nintendo Switch. This is in addition to regular patches, which are separate from content-heavy title updates, and typically focus on bugs. In other words, the team has been pretty busy! All of this work is clearly translating into sales, as Sunbreak alone (not to mention the success of Rise) is climbing Capcom&#x27;s Platinum Title (million-seller) list week after week.

                              <span>Gonna be a borstal breakout
Fans of those schoolyard roustabouts, the River City Girls, will be pleased to hear that the pugilistic duo&#x27;s series debut, River City Girls Zero, will be making its impact felt on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this month, following on from its release on Nintendo Switch back in March of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FpJ-UYq9T1k
As a quick cram session, River City Girls Zero is a revamped remaster of the 1994 Super Famicom title Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which is the first title in the Kunio-kun franchise to introduce Kyoko and Misako as playable characters. WayForward&#x27;s remaster sees the scrolling brawler officially localized for the west for the very first time, while sporting a freshly translated script, new manga cutscenes, and an amusing intro song by River City Girls series composer Megan McDuffee.
As a game... welllll... it has to be said that time has not been too kind to Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which was already quite dated by brawler standards even in 1994. But, as a little piece of franchise history, it&#x27;s still nice to see the long-lost title get some time in the spotlight. This release, of course, will also serve as an appetizer to WayForward&#x27;s long-awaited sequel River City Girls 2, which will be gracing us with its presence at some point later in 2022.
River City Girls Zero launches on PlayStation and Xbox platforms September 13, with PC (Steam) to follow on September 22. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out our thoughts on the remaster right here, along with our recent interview with Megan McDuffee!

Years back, the concept of &quot;early access games on Nintendo platforms&quot; sounded silly, but here we are with Disney Dreamlight Valley arriving on the platform on September 6. As a reminder, it&#x27;s described as a &quot;hybrid between a life-sim and an adventure game rich with quests, exploration, and engaging activities featuring Disney and Pixar friends, both old and new.&quot; Naturally, it will have some early access kinks to work out, and maybe even some Switch-specific hardware issues to patch, so keep an eye on that one as you would any early access game.
Ooblets is the other big release, which feels like it&#x27;s been in early access for two years: because it has! That&#x27;s out today. LEGO Brawls (September 2), Here Comes Niko (today), and JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adv…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ll never be your Beasts of Burden
A new entry in Square Enix and Alim&#x27;s Voice of Cards series is on the way. Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch on September 13, 2022.
Each entry is a role-playing game where everything is cards. Villages, overworld maps, enemies, and even dialogue windows are all portrayed as cards in a deck.
The Beasts of Burden is the third in the series, following after The Isle Dragon Roars and The Forsaken Maiden. This is a standalone experience though, so no need to worry about missing the plot.

James Bond aficionados eager to dive back into his video game adventures may have to showcase the steel-nerved patience of 007 himself. A recent financial report from developer IO Interactive appears to suggest that the previously teased Project 007 may still be some years away from receiving its release date.
As noted on Twitter by DarkDetective, the report notes that the Hitman developer is on track for a relatively successful fiscal year — predicting revenue in the region of $65 million USD — but that the company is bracing itself for at least two further years of decreased profit, due to a lack of any new releases and extended production periods. By proxy, this would suggest that although the Danish dev might already be hard at work on the untit…</span>

The next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game has been officially revealed. Ubisoft confirms that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the next entry in the series.
No more official info was shown, outside of the art reveal. Ubisoft says it plans to share about the game at its Ubisoft Forward event. The stream will air on September 10 at 3 p.m. ET, 12 p.m. PT. You&#x27;ll be able to follow it on Ubisoft&#x27;s Twitch channel here.

Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries has released a new roadmap update today, outlining the roadmap ahead for the latest Halo. While features like Forge are coming into focus, others are falling behind.
The next major update for Halo Infinite will arrive on November 8. Dubbed the Winter Update, this will include the campaign network co-op and mission replay previously targeted for late August. It will also include a beta version of the Forge, Halo&#x27;s map creation tool.
The Winter Update will also include a shorter, 30-tier Battle Pass and two new maps, Detachment and Argyle. A new beta for Match XP will roll out, the Covert One Flag mode will be added, and events will be hosted in December and January. This season will run thr…</span>

                              <span>Say hello to the newest addition to the Paldea region
Following several posts teasing the news, we&#x27;re seeing the newest addition to the Paldea region. Grafaiai is a new Pokemon debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
Grafaiai is categorized as the &quot;Toxic Monkey&quot; Pokemon. It&#x27;s naturally a Poison/Normal Type, and is pretty tiny.
According to the Pokemon page, Grafaiai is a moody Pokemon with a &quot;fastidious&quot; disposition. It&#x27;s a bit of a loner, and usually gets caught up in territorial fights with other Pokemon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4yrrF83tnY0
Grafaiai is nocturnal, and covers its hands in poison to mark patterns on trees as part of securing its territory. This poisonous saliva can paralyze Bug Pokemon, which Grafaiai can then collect up. Better keep your Butterfree away from it!
The saliva can change color based on what Grafaiai eats, and becomes concentrated when the little guy senses danger. I&#x27;m guessing by the name that Grafaiai is based on an Aye-Aye, which also forages for food and has incredibly long fingers.

Another addition to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
This adds to the list of new Pokemon arriving in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Alongside the Pokemon Grafaiai, we&#x27;ve also seen newcomers like Lechonk and Fidough, who both overtook the internet with their adorable designs.
While Grafaiai doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same ability to accost social media&#x27;s attention, I think it&#x27;s a neat design. And hey, another painter Pokemon to hang out with Smeargle.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are due to arrive on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch, with a host of features in tow. From riding a Legendary Pokemon as a bike to co-op adventures, it certainly seems like a very different Pokemon journey. Hopefully we&#x27;ll see some more new Pokemon, and maybe even some neat new regional variants for Paldea, in the run-up to November.

God of War combat is about to get a lot more interesting by the time Ragnarok rolls around, a new Game Informer cover story has revealed.
So combat and mechanical changes are always on the table for an action sequel, but lead combat designers Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh had a chance to shed some light on what that actually means for God of War Ragnarok recently. &quot;Playing with your food&quot; is still a staple concept, which stems from an old adage from God of War creators, where Kratos enjoys crushing his opponents and often revels in it. Atreus will also step things up now, and is referred to as a  &quot;powerhouse.&quot;
But the biggest alterations clearly deal with Kratos, who will have access to his classic chains [Blades of Chaos] and the relatively recent…</span>

Set in a dystopian future straight out of the cocaine haze of the 1970s, Rollerdrome takes two of gaming’s most cherished pastimes—pulling off sick combos and murder—and mashes them up into an audacious spectacle that is definitely not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. Taking control of mysterious rookie Kara Hassan, it’s skate or die for players as you’ll have to grab, grind, flip and twist your way to high-score combos while gunning down enemies hellbent on stopping you. Kara clearly has the skills to be the next Rollerdrome champion, but with the corporation behind the sport plotting against her, she’ll have to use every trick in the book to survive.
Again, this is not Norman Jewison’s Rollerball. With most of the social commentary pushed to the background in f…</span>

A McDonald&#x27;s Pokemon advertisement got a little out of hand in Singapore, heralding the arrival of Pokemon Violet and Pokemon...Violet? Right on: are we sure Nintendo got the announcement correct?
As spotted by NintendoSoup, the upcoming duo of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet were lumped together as just Violet in the Singapore ad, which adorns every tray at this particular location (and likely more). Interestingly, the collab also involves a &quot;Charizard McPepper Burger,&quot; &quot;Eevee Pies,&quot; and &quot;Pikachu and Scorbunny Frappes.&quot; Oh, and it&#x27;ll have a trading card game tie-in.
This silly snafu had me thinking about how much I appreciated a lot of high-level choices in Pokemon Legends. Of course, there&#x27;s room for improvement there. But in addition to the new capture mechanic, the idea of just buying one game and being done with it was a relief, especially for completionists.
The continuation of the dual game method has become a hot-button issue in recent years, especially since the series moved off of its exclusive home on handhelds. &quot;More money&quot; is a chief contributor to keeping that gravy train rolling, but the original Red and Blue idea of encouraging trading via the community did make sense. But with cold online trading as commonplace, the logistics of pushing two versions with every generation makes less and less sense. It&#x27;s likely not going to stop anytime soon, but more Legends releases would be a decent compromise.

Saber Interactive, developer of Evil Dead: The Game, has announced an official arrival date for Mia Allen, fan-favorite protagonist of Fede Álvarez&#x27;s great 2013 pseudo-reboot, Evil Dead — Mia will join her fellow party of survivors in the asymmetrical horror title on September 8, with her sights set on blood-splattered revenge.
In Álvarez&#x27;s film, Mia Allen (Jane Levy), her brother David, and a party of their friends stay at the fated woodland cabin in an ill-advised plan to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; on her heroin addiction. Unfortunately for Mia, her incredibly unlucky pals, and a particularly hapless dog, an ancient and malevolent evil descends upon the campsite, leading to demonic possession, cruel turns of fate, a storm of pure blood, and some truly hopeless and stomach-churning violence.

While Saber is yet to fully reveal Mia&#x27;s in-game abilities, they have teased footage of her very nicely crafted character model, which captures the morose, no-nonsense personality of Mia, complete with her casual gothic style. Machete in hand, our girl looks more than ready to stand alongside characters such as Eric the Red, Kelly Maxwell, and, of course, Ash Williams himself. In addition, brother David will also be joining the roster, trusty nailgun in hand. Mia and David will receive a full trailer at a later date, which will include a demonstration of Mia&#x27;s &quot;resistance to demonic possession.&quot;
I guess she built up an immunity...

Evil Dead: The Game is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

[Update: In a last-ditch effort to save face, the publisher has announced that the Ubisoft servers for the below games will be staying online for the time being. The &quot;decommission&quot; date has been moved to October 1, and DLC for Brotherhood, Assassin&#x27;s Creed III, Far Cry 3, and Blacklist can be downloaded before that date and aren&#x27;t lost to the void. There&#x27;s more info on the Assassin&#x27;s Creed games here.]
Ubisoft servers for 15 games will be shut down this week (as is customary), just in case you forgot that was eventually happening. Again, 15 games in all will be impacted, including five Assassin&#x27;s Creed titles.
As for how it works...it&#x27;s a bit complicated. Chiefly, Ubisoft shutdowns include taking servers offline, and eliminating multiplayer as an option. Ubisoft describes th…</span>

Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, perhaps better known to western audiences as Team Yakuza, has announced that it will be hosting a new episode of production web series next week, which will feature none other than studio director himself, Masayoshi Yokoyama, who will present fans with a &quot;sneak peek trailer.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jMIrQbJ5K2E
The developer did not offer any further hint as to what the trailer will be giving us a &quot;sneak peek&quot; of, but the rumor mill has been turning for some time — spilling stories that a &quot;Yakuza 8&quot; is currently in the works at the veteran studio. With Tokyo Game Show kicking off in just a fortnight&#x27;s time, now would be the perfect opportunity for a Japanese company to get the hype engine in motion for a brand new release. The stream will also feature a gallery of specially selected fan art reflecting the studio&#x27;s games.
The Ryu ga Gotoku Studio TV #12.5 episode will premiere on the developer&#x27;s official YouTube channel Thursday, September 8, at 20:00 JST. This is, obviously, an eye-watering 02:00 PT / 05:00 ET, but fret not, as we will be sure to have all of the pertinent details on the new trailer right here on Destuctoid, ready and waiting for you when you eventually roll outta bed and into your snakeskin shoes.

Surprise! I&#x27;m here on a Wednesday! I&#x27;ll also be here for the usual weekly stream on Friday, but today you get extra. We&#x27;re not doing anything too nutty today — maybe try some more Thymesia since that game got REALLY tough super fast, or more specifically I was thinking of just chilling with a cute little arcade tycoon game called Arcade Paradise. We&#x27;re gonna manage profits and try to flip the family laundry business into a top-notch arcade.

I haven&#x27;t played many games like this, but I&#x27;m looking forward to it! See you there.
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

                              <span>Do you need a hint?
I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I get stuck in video games a lot, whether it&#x27;s a shooter, simulator, or open-world adventure. I am very much cool with the idea of using wikis (you paid for the game — enjoy it how you want), but recently, I&#x27;ve been trying to challenge myself more and not get so frustrated when I can&#x27;t immediately figure out what to do.
You see, there is more than one way to get stuck in a video game.
The first is when you come up against a challenge you don&#x27;t know how to beat. You know exactly what you need to be doing, you just can&#x27;t overcome the challenge the game is presenting. Usually this comes in the form of a boss fight or a difficult platforming section — any gameplay section that requires precise inputs and timing will do.

Sometimes it&#x27;s just h…</span>

                              <span>The patch is out now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch coming soon
[Update: Following the PC patch, the PlayStation and Xbox versions of Arcade Paradise have also been updated, while the Nintendo Switch equivalent is expected to go live next week. As someone who&#x27;s still happily grinding away arcade challenges, I&#x27;m happy to see bug fixes, balance changes, and other issues shored up. One of my lingering Zombat 2 trophies finally popped, and I may be able to survive Knuckles &amp; Knees at long last.
According to the team, there are two problems to watch out for that&#x27;ll be further patched:
If you quit the game using the PDA, or end the day, within a few seconds of placing a newly delivered machine, your progression will be blocked. When you reload your save a duplicate machine will arrive…</span>

                              <span>Cloudflare suggests that it made a mistake by terminating the accounts of The Daily Stormer and 8Chan. These decisions made it harder for the company to defend itself against overbroad termination requests and invited a wave of follow-up demends, from activists to copyright holders. This isn&#x27;t a position Cloudflare wants to be in.

Earlier distress signals suggested that HDFilme and xCine might be in trouble, but their domains diverting to ACE leaves no doubt. Importantly, both sites were operated from Vietnam, an increasingly big player in global piracy that has the MPA worried.

As well as the Yeti and Snowball USB microphones that are most likely to be familiar to you, there&#x27;s also a rare 42% discount on the Blue Blackout Spark XLR mic - nice. 
However, the microphones I&#x27;d like to focus on today are those popular options, specifically the Blue Snowball Ice and the Blue Yeti X. These represent the top and the bottom of the Blue spectrum when it comes to gaming-friendly USB mics.

Today I&#x27;d like to suggest adding Skybox Satellite, a Twitter account which shows glimpses of the skies wrapped around maps in GoldSrc games like Half-Life and Counter-Strike. It&#x27;s sometimes pretty, sometimes nostalgic, and sometimes impressive.

From what I&#x27;d seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that&#x27;s not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.
So, at this year&#x27;s Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios&#x27; chief technology officer Mark James about what I&#x27;d seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.

                              <span>Last week HyperX announced their first-ever gaming monitors, the Armada 25 and Armada 27, and within a couple of days I was being led into their Gamescom booth to try each of them for myself. After a disappointingly uncomfortable preview of the Samsung Odyssey Ark, it was nice to get to grips with a far more utilitarian pair of monitors – albeit not without a party trick of their own, namely HyperX’s Armada Gaming Mount.

Wowzer! Thanks for being with us for this record-breaking feat. We asked for suggestions and received many excellent ones, but in the end we went with a suggestion from Jonathon which, at the time we recorded, I did not realise would be instantly revealed by the episode title. Cheers to you all!

                              <span>Further investigation of Microsoft’s $68.7 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard is needed by the UK’s competition regulator, a statement on the government’s website confirmed today. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began the preliminary stage of their investigation at the beginning of July, with a deadline set for September 1st. That initial stage of investigation found that the deal could “substantially lessen competition in gaming consoles, multi-game subscription services, and cloud gaming services”.

The images show what’s purported to be artwork of something called The Forty Thieves Quest for the rumoured Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, also known by the development name of Rift.

                              <span>Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it&#x27;s acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana&#x27;s surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.


At the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as &quot;Project Code Name &#x27;M&#x27;&quot; now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.

                              <span>There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.


Meant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.

                              <span>Today was due to be the day when some older Ubisoft games would see their online services decommissioned, but the company is granting them a temporary reprieve. You now have until October 1st to cram in some multiplayer for several early Assassin’s Creeds, the original version of Far Cry 3, Driver: San Francisco and others. Ubisoft say they’ve been “exploring what is possible to reduce disruption” over the last month, hence the shuffled date for decommissioning.

                              <span>If the CPU is the brain of your computer and the GPU is the heart, then the power supply are the muscles, turning those thoughts and feelings into concrete action. Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense... 
In any case, power supplies are important, mm&#x27;kay, and this 550W 80+ Gold modular one from Corsair is discounted here in the UK. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay £78 for this model - and at least £65 for one of this spec from a notable brand - but at Currys you can combine a price reduction with the code FNDDGAMING to get this PSU delivered for only £40.

At the beginning of last month, we were blown away by the amount of fun that we had getting to grips with Two Point Campus — earning the game a top-of-the-class 9/10 in our review. It is therefore with great joy that we spotted Two Point Studios&#x27; announcement that the game has now amassed over one million players worldwide.
It is true that this total is representative of players across all consoles, so yes, we assume that this also includes Xbox Game Pass. But a total of one million players in under a month for an indie developer is nothing to be scoffed at.

September is already setting up to be a packed month for game releases. Lego Brawls, Temtem, Splatoon 3, Return to Monkey Island, The DioField Chronicle... the list goes on. But despite the fact that our micro SD cards are already dropping a belt loop to make way for all of this upcoming content, we couldn&#x27;t help but get excited about just one more title.
Haiku the Robot is an adorable 2D pixel Metroidvania which looks as if it has stepped right out of a Game Boy cartridge. Sort of like Pixar&#x27;s WALL.E but with much more hacking robots to pieces with an oversized sword, the game will see you control Haiku as you attempt to navigate a world bereft of all life after a nuclear explosion. See? Just like WALL.E.

Today (September 1st, 2022) marks 30 years since the launch of Super Mario Kart in North America. In the years since, Mario Kart has gone on to be one of the most successful Nintendo franchises of all time, with the latest mainline release - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - topping the Switch&#x27;s best-selling titles with over 40 million units sold. Mad!
So to celebrate, we thought we&#x27;d take a look at how each of us was introduced to the Mario Kart franchise, and we&#x27;d love to find out how you were introduced, too! Check out our &quot;origin&quot; stories below and be sure to post your own in the comments below.

Conradical Games&#x27; The Outbound Ghost has been haunting our thoughts ever since it was confirmed to be coming to Switch, and we might not have too long to wait. Merge Games has confirmed it&#x27;s working on a physical release of the turn-based RPG, heavily inspired by Paper Mario, and we should be able to pick up a box of this ghostly adventure on 25th November.
Developer Conradical Games shared a launch trailer for the game yesterday — which is hovering over to PC via Steam, Epic, and GOG on 21st September. As for an eShop release, all we know so far is &quot;later in 2022&quot;, but if that 25th November physical date is true, then we imagine we&#x27;ll be seeing it before then.

The best-selling Switch game of the week is SD Gundam Battle Alliance, a multiplayer action RPG set in the hugely popular Gundam universe. The game has charted three separate times — on Switch, PS4, and PS5 — with the Nintendo release of the game placing in second place right behind Earth Defense Force 6 on PS4. The Gundam game managed to sell a respectable 38,634 units on its debut on the hybrid console.

The Pokémon Company is suing six Chinese companies over a mobile game that shares stark similarites to the Pokémon franchise itself, citing copyright infringement and unfair competition behaviour, as reported by South China Morning Post (thanks, GamesIndustry,biz).
The Japanese giant, owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures, is seeking damages of 500 million yuan (US$72.5 million) and requesting that the offending companies issue public apologies on Chinese websites and mobile apps. Naturally, it is also demanding that the game in question - Pocket Monster Reissue, or Koudaiyaoguai Fuke in Chinese - be removed from sale alongside all promotional material.

After three years of Covid delays, Nintendo Live is coming back to Tokyo from October 8th to 9th. The event will feature live presentations, entertainment, gaming tournaments and some playable game demos all topped off with live music performances — the line-up for which has just been announced.
Pulling out three performances a day, Nintendo Live will be headlined by a DJ set from Animal Crossing&#x27;s very own K.K. Slider in a show called &#x27;DJ. K.K. Paradise Mixx!&#x27;. Also performing are Splatoon 3&#x27;s brand new musical hosts Deep Cut. All performances will have the same content if you are lucky enough to be attending the event in person, and for those of us who won&#x27;t be in Tokyo at the time, Sunday&#x27;s final show will be live-streamed via YouTube Live, providing immaculate vibes around the world.

Minifigure brawler LEGO Brawls is coming to Switch tomorrow (September 2nd) and publisher Bandai Namco has today released a new trailer, &#x27;Minifigure Mania&#x27;, which shows off the game&#x27;s expansive customisation options.
Showing the Brawler Builder function in action, the new trailer shows how you will be able to customise every element of your fighter from their hats all the way down to their feet before throwing them into battle. Battling with your malicious minifigure will be the best way to unlock new parts — so why not do it in style?

                              <span>After growing to become one of the most-leaked games in franchise history, Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is real and we&#x27;ll be learning more about it next week.
That&#x27;s because the publisher is hosting a Ubisoft Forward on Sept. 10 at Noon P.T./3 p.m. ET, which has been previously advertised as the event where we&#x27;ll learn more about the future of Assassin&#x27;s Creed and more. It seems Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it&#x27;s possible we learn more about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft&#x27;s in-development Assassin&#x27;s Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin&#x27;s Creed games, too. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the next Assassin&#x27;s Creed game.

If rumors and leaks about Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage are correct, we&#x27;re in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he&#x27;s not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin&#x27;s order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.
The potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed and new Assassin&#x27;s Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they&#x27;re downright exhausting. An Assassin&#x27;s Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin&#x27;s Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer.

Online Campaign Co-Op
The biggest addition in the update finally goes live following a beta period in July. Campaign co-op, which supports up to four players, features cross-platform support, shared progression, mission replay, and a batch of new achievements. 
However, campaign co-op will be online only. 343 announced that it has chosen to cease development on local splitscreen co-op to reallocate those resources towards quickly implementing online updates and improvements based on player feedback.

                              <span>In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.
Spencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. 
Spencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. 
Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it&#x27;s anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won&#x27;t be until 2024 at the earliest.

Later in that same year, the studio revealed Deathpool, a second original character that imagined what a child of Deadpool and Death would look and act like.

                              <span>After growing in early access for two years, Ooblets finally sprouts in its 1.0 form today. The cheerful game blends monster collecting (the Ooblets), farming simulation, and light town management as you restore a wacky village to its former glory. Though an overall laid-back experience, there’s a lot of spinning plates involved, and it can take time to figure out how to maximize each day to keep your farm brimming with valuable crops, your roster full of different Ooblets, and your wallet stretched with Gummies (the game’s currency). That’s where I come in. I’ve spent many hours playing the final version of the game, and I’d like to offer some helpful tips to make your early hours in Badgetown as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

Endnight Games&#x27; post on Twitter (seen above) says, in recent months, an exact drop date has been hard to pinpoint, but the newfound scope led to the team&#x27;s hard decision:
Based on trailers, Sons of the Forest is the studio&#x27;s most ambitious title yet, with a vast open world, a new AI companion, updated visuals, and multiple warring factions scattered throughout the landscape. It looks to be even more brutal and terrifying than the last game, and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it.

                              <span>Britská společnost ARM podala žalobu na jednoho ze svých největších partnerů, firmu Qualcomm. Ta vloni koupila za 1,4 miliardy dolarů společnost Nuvia a s ní převzala i vývoj procesoru Phoenix, do kterého se vkládají velké naděje. ARM ale tvrdí, že licence není přenositelná a s nákupem tedy automaticky nepřechází na Qualcomm.</span>

Těm, kdo se chystají stavět si novou mašinu, zbyde více peněz na hardwarové komponenty, nebo si budou moci koupit nějaké extra licence, které zprvu zavrhli. Je tomu možno díky vysokým slevám od Goodoffer24 v porovnání s oficiálními seznamy.</span>

                              <span>The RX 6950 XT is AMD&#x27;s flagship card, a 4K gaming powerhouse that can put almost any game to shame - as long as you don&#x27;t turn on ray tracing, anyway. The card launched at £1100 but often sold for far more, but now we&#x27;re starting to see things slide the other way - and the top AMD GPU now costs only £800 at Overclockers in the UK. That&#x27;s £300 below RRP and a new low-water mark.

                              <span>Nightdive&#x27;s remake of 1994 classic System Shock hasn&#x27;t had the smoothest development run, first having some money issues in its Kickstarter a while back, then having to reboot itself with twenty-twenty-something release dates chucked out there more as hopeful concepts than assurances. 
Having gone hands-on with a short 20-minute-ish demo of the game at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, I can confirm that the remake is real and seems faithful to the original despite some heavy tinkers in the modernisation station. For nostalgic fans it should make for an exciting revisit to cyberspace, but I&#x27;m unsure whether it&#x27;ll land quite as well for newcomers seeking a showdown with Shodan.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman&#x27;s Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you&#x27;re part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. 
This is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I&#x27;ve been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. &quot;I usually tell people, &#x27;Oh, you should make a game in like six months&#x27;, and I have tried to do that in the past,&quot; he tells me. &quot;This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.&quot; And, while I am sure that most developers don&#x27;t wish they&#x27;d been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.

                              <span>Stranded: Alien Dawn is Haemimont Games’ second sci-fi sim on the trot, and despite being set on a planet that actually has air this time, it could well make Surviving Mars’ well-funded colony building feel like an afternoon playing with Lego. In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.


“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios&#x27; seminal survival sim.

Katharine and Liam had a great time poking around PAX East back in April and we’re now making our way over to the west coast to make more exclusive videos for RPS premium supporters.
This time, Liam will be joined by myself (hello!) as we cover the show floor from top to bottom, from when the doors open on Friday, September 2nd until they boot everyone out the evening of Monday, September 25th. We’ll be interviewing developers, attending panels, and sharing our thoughts on the best upcoming games on the show floor. If you fancy joining us on our tour through PAX, you can sign up to the RPS supporter program today for just £6 / $8 monthly.

It’s a collection of their many minigame interpretations of the classic single-player card game, solitaire. The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection releases on Steam on September 6th, and adds a new version themed around tarot decks. Each version of the card game has been updated with 4K graphics. Have a sneaky peek at the trailer below.

                              <span>I went into my High On Life hands-on session with one expectation: its talking alien guns will annoy the heck out of me. But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne&#x27;s multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.
And most importantly, the guns didn&#x27;t annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I&#x27;ve played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you&#x27;re a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games&#x27; back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.

                              <span>In this segment of New Gameplay Today, your host, Game Informer Associate Editor Wesley LeBlanc, walks you through how Saturnalia works as both a survival horror game and a roguelike. In it, you&#x27;ll see him control Anita, one of the game&#x27;s many playable characters, as she searches for her partner in the small town of Sardinia, Italy.
Unfortunately for Anita, it&#x27;s not a great time to be in the town because of some strange ritualistic things happening. That translates to a terrifying creature that stalks Anita and others through the darkness of the night and you must avoid it all while remaining alive as you search for clues to end this night of terror and misery. 
In the New Gameplay Today segment below, we have more than 15 minutes of brand-new Saturnalia footage to showcase. Enjoy!


Saturnalia is being developed and published by Santa Ragione. It&#x27;s due out on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime this year. For more, check out the Saturnalia reveal trailer.</span>

Either way, it packs many enhancements over the base game. While I didn&#x27;t care much for Part I, if you&#x27;re interested in checking it out yourself, here are some of the biggest changes you can expect. 
Accessibility Options
The Last of Us Part I comes with Naughty Dog&#x27;s full suite of accessibility options. And that&#x27;s something worth commending. This comes in the shape of fully customizable controls, a host of visual aids, options to alleviate motion sickness, help with navigating levels, options for the deaf or hard-of-hearing, and combat accessibility.

                              <span>I remember the release of The Last of Us better than any other video game – which is to say I remember it at all. 
In 2013, I was 19 and still practicing the unfortunate act of pre-ordering video games before I knew if they were good or not. As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. 
And when I did, it was everything I could&#x27;ve hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true anymore – it pretty shamelessly borrows from Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s The Road, No Country F…</span>

                              <span>The year of acquisitions and shareholding antics continues. 
Just today, Chinese developer-publisher NetEase announced it was acquiring Detroit: Become Human dev Quantic Dream, and now, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent have increased their stakes in From Software, the prolific developer behind the Dark Souls series and this year’s mega-hit, Elden Ring. 
This news comes from Gematsu, which posted a press release from Kadokawa Corporation, the parent company behind From Software. It says that through third-party allotment, Sixjoy Hong Kong, a Tencent Holdings subsidiary, has purchased 16.25% of From Software’s shares, while SIE has acquired 14.09%. Despite this, Kadokawa Corporation is still the largest shareholder of From Software, holding 69.66% of the shares.

                              <span>Quantic Dream, the developer behind games like Detroit: Become Human and Heavy Rain, has been acquired by NetEase Game, one of China’s largest video game companies whose catalog of games developed and published include Knives Out, Naraka Bladepoint, and more. 
This news comes from a posting released by NetEase today that calls Quantic Dream its first studio in Europe. It’s unclear how much the acquisition cost NetEase, but the developer-publisher says it will allow the studio to continue to operate independently, focusing on creating and publishing games while supporting third-party developed titles too. 


“We are thrilled to embark on an exciting new stage of growth with Quantic Dream, bound by our shared vision, mutual trust, and respect,” CEO and director of NetEase William Ding writes…</span>

The series’ current direction is inspired by an old studio motto: Playing with your food.
“That’s an internal philosophy that we’ve had since back in the day,” Sheth says. “Kratos plays with his food. We tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, ‘We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.’ That’s been the guiding principle more than anything else.”

Dále bylo opraveno mnoho chyb v komponentách, ale i ve stávajících šablonách. Také byla povýšena podpora TimescaleDB na verzi 2.7.x.

                              <span>The Last Of Us Part I&#x27;s remake is heading to PlayStation 5 on September 2nd, which I assume is of modest interest if you want to play Joel and Ellie&#x27;s story over from the beginning with prettier graphics. It&#x27;s more interesting to us in PC land because it&#x27;ll be the first time the heart-and-zombie smasher makes its way to PC - albeit &quot;very soon&quot; after its console release.

Below, a new seven-minute clip of the remaster in action.

                              <span>Most &#x27;realistic graphics&#x27; mods make games look worse, but that&#x27;s not the case with NaturalVision Evolved. The long-in-development Grand Theft Auto 5 mod is a comprehensive revamp of lighting, textures, models and much more, but it remains faithful to the art direction of the base game. 

You can now download a Single Player Beta of the mod - and even if you don&#x27;t plan on doing that, it&#x27;s worth watching the trailer below.

                              <span>The Crucial P2 is a great value NVMe SSD, and now the 2TB model is down to £117 at Amazon UK - an incredibly low price for a drive that can hit 2400MB/s. The 1TB model has also been discounted in the same sale, from £86 to £63, making it cheaper than many SATA SSDs of the same size.

                              <span>The thrill of a card game is in the hand you get dealt. Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn&#x27;t go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It&#x27;s a gripping mix that&#x27;s already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it&#x27;s a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access.

                              <span>While mooching around Samsung’s Gamescom booth, waiting for their 990 Pro SSD reveal, I took the opportunity to play with an altogether more unusual addition to their hardware catalogue. The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. 


I actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.

                              <span>Back in February, Alice O. highlighted an expansion planned for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla that’s reportedly being spun-off into a standalone stealth game. At the time the project was being referred to as Rift, but multiple sources are now saying the game will be called Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.

Speaking of Nineties nostalgia, you can watch a retro trailer for MultiVersus below. Makes me feel ten again.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to level with you: I&#x27;m not a GSG player. I play strategy, sure, but grand strategy has always been a bit beyond me. I&#x27;m a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I&#x27;m unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.
I&#x27;m trying to learn new languages, though, so it&#x27;s not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you&#x27;re only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it&#x27;s better at playing the game than I am.

                              <span>Of all the games I saw at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, sci-fi team-based shooter Hyenas easily claims the title of &quot;Most Confusing Overall Experience&quot;. Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I&#x27;d eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.
I sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA&#x27;s stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game&#x27;s insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.

                              <span>AMD have, at long last, fully unveiled the Ryzen 7000 series of gaming CPUs – specs, pricing, the lot. There’s even a release date, September 27th, which will see AMD launch an initial salvo of four mid-to-high-end chips. These will aim to leapfrog Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors, several of which are among the best CPUs for gaming we’ve yet tried, with the aid of a new Zen 4 core design, DDR5/PCIe 5.0 support and some ambitious clock speed boosts.

                              <span>Drumroll, please, for the latest interactive, live action, film archival puzzle from Sam Barlow, of Her Story and Telling Lies. This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That&#x27;s a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?
In typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn&#x27;t easily spooled through. From one starting clip you&#x27;re able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.
Now. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!

The Death Knights aren’t the only thing arriving in WOW Classic before the expansion though, as there’s a fresh profession and a zombie infestation to consider too. Have a watch of some of the senior dev team discussing Death Knights in the video below.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarök is set to conclude the Norse era of the series, a saga that’s seen Kratos atone for his troubling past by becoming a more conscientious god and (mildly) affectionate father. In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  
I spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops. Moreover, you’ll learn about Kratos’ tools/toys, a never-before-seen dwarven realm that feels lived in, the unprecedented number of accessibility features available …</span>

                              <span>Get your shovels ready because Shovel Knight Dig will burrow its way onto Switch, PC, and iOS via Apple Arcade next month. 
More specifically, the exciting Shovel Knight follow-up/spin-off title will hit those platforms on Sept. 23. What&#x27;s more is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, you can play the game for free. It&#x27;ll cost $24.99 on Switch and on Steam, however.
This news was revealed in a comical trailer released by Yacht Club Games, which you can watch for yourself below: 


&quot;When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight&#x27;s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;But as he and Shield Knight soon discover, this adventure goes much deeper than a simple heist.&quot;
&quot;Meet new friends and foes, visit strange lands, and outfit yourself in your quest to keep the entire land from collapsing underfoot. Jump, slash, and dig your way down an ever-changing chasm of mystery in Shovel Knight Dig, an all-new Shovel Knight adventure.&quot; 

While waiting to play Shovel Knight Dig on Sept. 23, read about Scrap Knight, a new character that will be featured in the game, and then watch the reveal trailer for the title.

But I can tell you that Sonic Frontiers is the first entry in the series I’ve been looking forward to since the Dreamcast.  
For reference, the last time I was excited to play a 3D Sonic game, it was attached to the Dreamcast kiosk at my local target. And to be fair, the orca jumping over the racetrack in the Sonic Adventure demo was a great reason to bug my mom for a new Sega console.

                              <span>Na trh míří grafické karty Intel Arc základního levného typu A380. Phoronix otestoval model od společnosti ASRock s cenovkou 139,99 USD (podrobnosti na webu ASRocku), což v přímém přepočtu činí cca 3 500 Kč, ale cena v Česku jistě bude o něco vyšší – pro srovnání nejbližší konkurenční karta, tedy Radeon RX 6400, se prodává kolem 4 500 Kč. Testovalo se na jádru Linux 6.0-rc2 v kombinaci s X Server 1.21.1.3 + Wayland a Mesa 22.3 devel, což je kombinace obsahující již poměrně slušnou podporu pro Arc, avšak už nyní víme, že do Linuxu 6.1 míří další vylepšení. Tento úvodní test tedy berme jako orientační srovnání s konkurencí.</span>

                              <span>Gungrave G.O.R.E. marks the return of the Gungrave franchise after almost 20 years (well, besides that VR game), and today we found out that the sequel is coming just in time for Thanksgiving. A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you&#x27;ll be riddling them with bullets. 
The largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they&#x27;d expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.</span>

                              <span>Mafia celebrates its 20th anniversary today, and in a new blog post by Hanger 13, the principal minds behind the series reflect on its creation and history while also teasing what’s next.
Longtime Mafia designers Roman Hladík (general manager), Tomáš Hřebíček (head of production/media director), and Alex Cox (game director) sat down to discuss Mafia’s entire history and their most cherished memories of the franchise. It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.
Hřebíček writes: 
“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we&#x27;re happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition.

                              <span>Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. 
This news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.
Deadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. 
This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil.

There’s something about the memory of that taste that is amazing, even if you know the sophistication of your palette has evolved a lot in the intervening years. That’s a bit how I feel about the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games. I can recall with crystal clarity being gathered around a TMNT arcade cabinet with my friends, pumping in tokens to try and beat Shredder before the birthday party ended. Or spending a weekend banging my head against the wall of the first NES game and its absurd sewer challenges. The Cowabunga Collection exists to service the nostalgic recollection of these types of experiences, and it does so with aplomb. Are these truly great games worth …</span>

                              <span>Hallo! Monday is a bank holiday for us here in the UK, so we&#x27;ll leave you with Alice Bee until the rest of us return on Tuesday (well, aside from those of us taking more time). This is the last big holiday weekend of summer, a traditional time to get out in the countryside or down to the seaside. Could use a little heat and joy with the terrible, terrible winter to come. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. On this episode, we&#x27;ll say &quot;Jackpot&quot; to Season 6 as we conclude with the latest title in the series, Devil May Cry 5.
Released March 8, 2019, Devil May Cry 5 serves as a return to the classic timeline after an over-decade-long hiatus. Nero reprises his starring role, but he&#x27;s joined by Dante and mysterious newcomer V. The three demon slayers, alongside familiar allies, unite to combat a powerful demon lord. Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a &quot;homerun&quot; with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Meta released a demo of its conversational AI this week. The BlenderBot can engage in some clever discussions but also has a more devious side to it. As it turns out, the bot uses torrent sites to download content when it&#x27;s not made available legally, and it also admits to streaming leaked movies.

                              <span>Not since the cruelly overlooked Blast-off has a game so accurately pressed the faster! button in my brain.
Neodash is a type of racing game that pops up relatively often; a time trial crossed with an obstacle course and a little of what I suppose is the endless runner. Picture Trackmania but with the courses condensed into short bursts of high speed dodging and you&#x27;re basically there. They&#x27;re often very throwaway and don&#x27;t really hold my interest for long. Neodash grabs hold immediately.

In case you missed it, it&#x27;s a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation of the cult 1988 horror film of the same name, but details on how its creepy clowning around would actually work were few and far between, to say the least. Thankfully, I sat in on a developer presentation earlier this week to find out exactly how it stacks up to other asymmetrical horror film games out there at the moment, as well as how it hopes to evolve and redefine the hide-and-seek genre as a whole.

Protagonist Kara Hassan is the newest competitor in Matterhorn’s games, hosted by the corrupt International Rollerdrome Federation. Your job is to skate through 12 intense arena maps battling both the house players and yourself, dodging attacks as you replenish your ammo with sick tricks to stay in the fight. With enough combo multipliers and top completion times, you might come out as the champion.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a hot minute since I last crossed paths with JRPG series Wild Arms and Shadow Hearts, but today the key creators behind both of these late 90s and early 00s RPGs have announced they&#x27;re making two brand-new JRPGs that are inspired by their previous works - and they&#x27;re launching a &#x27;double Kickstarter&#x27; campaign to help fund them. The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who&#x27;s making what), and based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m intrigued.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is a good middle-of-the-road PCIe 4.0 SSD, outperforming PCIe 3.0 SSDs while costing less than the very fastest PCIe 4.0 models. It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it&#x27;s down to £84 where it&#x27;s rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here&#x27;s why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.
Let&#x27;s do the &#x27;where to find them&#x27; bit first. It&#x27;s quite simple: WD&#x27;s UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you&#x27;d prefer the larger 2TB model.

                              <span>It wouldn&#x27;t be Gamescom without a Geoff Keighley liveshow to kick it all off, would it? Tuesday&#x27;s Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren&#x27;t given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.


You&#x27;d be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I&#x27;ve once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.


Much like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!

                              <span>The Steam Deck is a brilliant system, but its internal storage is limited - from anywhere from 64GB to 512GB depending on the model you chose. Thankfully, Micro SD cards are getting extremely affordable, even in massive sizes all the way up to 1TB. Smaller sizes like 256GB and 512GB are better value per gigabyte, but today in the UK there&#x27;s been a big discount on a 1TB Lexar Play Micro SD card that brings it into contention too. 
The Lexar Play 1TB is now retailing for £110 at Amazon, compared to a usual price of £140. If you&#x27;d prefer something a little more high performance, the highly-rated SanDisk Extreme 1TB card is also on sale, dropping from £220 to £140.

                              <span>Minecraft Legends was first announced at Geoff Fest earlier this year, and a smidge more footage dropped again at a Nintendo Direct Mini. But despite both of these events, it&#x27;s been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there&#x27;s been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.
Colour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year&#x27;s Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft&#x27;s colourful cube-verse.

                              <span>Eight years ago Graham (who used to be to blame for all of this) got hands-on with Dead Island 2, back when the game was being developed by Yager, the folks behind Spec Ops: The Line. Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn&#x27;t expressed interest yet, but there&#x27;s time.
So going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie &#x27;em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.

                              <span>Dunno if you’ve noticed by there’s an awful lot of sci-fi games on the way, most of which – these being games – revolve around shooting space creatures to glowing green bits. Deliver Us Mars, the recently delayed sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, takes a more peaceful option, now blending the original’s puzzling with some Tomb Raider reboot-style platforming. Your deadliest enemy here is gravity, and as far as I understand, you can’t shoot that.

                              <span>Amazon are intending to announce they’ve made an offer to buy publishing colossus Electronic Arts later today, according to a new report from USA Today’s For The Win, who cite sources from Swedish gaming agency GLHF. No clue yet as to how much they’d be paying, but it’s likely to be ranging in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Maybe just not as many as Microsoft’s $68.7 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, revealed in January.

                              <span>Streaming giants Netflix have a BioShock movie to make and, after pointing their golf club at various directors, they’ve selected Francis Lawrence. He’s best known for overseeing three of The Hunger Games movies and is working on the prequel coming out next year, The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes. 


Netflix have also hired screenwriter Michael Green for the BioShock flick. Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.

                              <span>Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.
Frozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. 


On September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  
Nobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, 
“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It&#x27;s most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Team Ninja’s dark fantasy action title Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty impresses in a new gameplay trailer that captures the fast-paced thrills you&#x27;d expect from the minds behind Nioh and Ninja Gaiden. 
Fans of the studio&#x27;s previous action titles should find plenty to love with Wo Long if this video is any indication. Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you&#x27;ll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. 


Next month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. 
In a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has &quot;no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: 
&quot;While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”
Although the PlayStation 5&#x27;s price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. 
The only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S.

                              <span>It&#x27;s late on a Thursday afternoon. It&#x27;s time for a break. Let&#x27;s finally getting back to our Gundam streams. We&#x27;re going live over on our Twitch channel to build the Master Grade Tallgeese from Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. 
Join us at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT) to watch the build. We likely won&#x27;t get through the whole thing today, but we&#x27;ll be live for at least a couple of hours. 
And as you might&#x27;ve guessed from the picture above, we have a lot more Gunpla kits to get through. Bandai was nice enough to send us a few, and we&#x27;ll absolutely be live streaming lots of fun hobby-adjacent activities over the next few weeks.
 Again, we&#x27;re going live on our Twitch channel at 5:00 P.M. Central Time (6:00 P.M. ET/3:00 P.M. PT). Hope to see you there!</span>

                              <span>After revealing earlier this year that it was making a BioShock movie, Netflix has announced who will be directing it and who&#x27;s writing the script. And you might recognize them, and if not, you&#x27;ll almost certainly recognize the movies they&#x27;ve worked on. 
Netflix revealed in a tweet made today that Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Slumberland) will direct this BioShock film adaptation and Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) will write the script.

And that&#x27;s all Netflix had to reveal about the movie today. Perhaps we&#x27;ll learn of casting soon. In the meantime, read about the original announcement.

                              <span>Atomic Heart reemerged during Gamescom with a new trailer devoted solely to showing off its impressive, Bioshock-esque combat. Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you&#x27;ll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. 
Players wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. 


Atomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. 
Atomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

A video game sequel is hard to create, especially if the previous game was a commercial success. Why did the game resonate with fans? How many new features does the sequel need to justify another price tag? Should anything be changed at all? How do you make something fresh while retaining the identity established in the first release?
These are the questions developers constantly ask themselves while making a game. The road to publishing a project is full of pitfalls, and it’s easy to lose the path.

Mutants named Neon, Susan, Ratfink, and Goober have come to the surface to fight for their place in Knockout City, but they aren&#x27;t the only mutants coming to town. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles join them in the dodgeball battlefields of Knockout City this season.
When the 13-week season featuring Mutant Mutiny launches on August 30, Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael join the game as playable characters for any dodgebrawl match – each turtle features a unique intro pose. If players want more TMNT action in Knockout City, they can purchase the Premium Brawl Pass featuring TMNT rewards, a new map, new hideout customizations and more.


Those looking to get the most TMNT fun out of this season of Knockout City can look forward to …</span>

                              <span>Each year, every NHL team strives to put the best squad it can on the ice. Sometimes, that means a full offseason overhaul. In other years, that means fine-tuning some lesser areas of an already solid team. NHL 22 was a good-looking game, but the gameplay felt long in the tooth and in need of changes. While NHL 23 doesn’t rebuild the gameplay from the ground up, it does offer several features, tweaks, and enhancements in hopes of being better than the last iteration.
NHL 23 represents the series’ second entry using EA’s Frostbite engine. As such, various refinements come online as the development team further familiarizes itself with the proprietary engine. EA Vancouver is also implementing several gameplay tweaks, including last-chance puck movement. This adds hundreds of new stumble anim…</span>

                              <span>In February, we reported the server shutdown of Dark Souls 3 after a dangerous hack – Remote Code Execution – rendered affected PCs inoperable. Attackers &quot;executed arbitrary code on a remote device, meaning they could take control of a player&#x27;s PC.&quot; But thankfully, seven months later, the servers are back online. 
The official Dark Souls Twitter account initially confirmed servers would remain offline beyond the release of Elden Ring. However, the extensive deactivation period that ensued couldn&#x27;t have been anticipated. The RCE hack affected all three Dark Souls games. And now that the third entry&#x27;s multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too. 
PC版『DARK SOULS III』におけるセキュリティの脆弱性調査と対応が完了したため、本日よりゲームサーバーを復旧し、オンラインサービスを再開しました。ユーザーの皆様にはお詫び申し上げますとともに、復旧をお待ちいただいたことへの御礼を申し上げます。 https://t.co/mPmnBK9Wbd

A translated From Software Support tweet (see above) reads as follows:

&quot;We have completed the security vulnerability investigation and countermeasures for the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS III,&quot; so we have restored the game server and resumed online services from today. We apologize to all users and thank you for waiting for the restoration.

In addition, we are also working on the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS Ⅱ&quot; and the PC version of &quot;DARK SOULS REMASTERED,&quot; and we will inform you as soon as they are restored.

Following news from Sony Interactive Entertainment earlier today that it has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 in multiple non-U.S. markets, Microsoft has revealed that it will not follow suit. 
A Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central that the company has no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles. 
&quot;We are constantly evaluating our business to offer our fans great gaming options,&quot; the spokesperson told the publication. &quot;Our Xbox Series S suggested retail price remains at $299 (£250, €300) [and] the Xbox Series X [remains] $499 (£450, €500).”

The card in question is a PowerColor Fighter model, with a simple two-fan design that should be more than capable of dealing with this mid-range card&#x27;s modest 175W TDP.

                              <span>One of the advantages to games heading westward long after an initial release in Asia is that there&#x27;s sometimes a stack of existing update content already waiting to be localised. Perhaps that&#x27;s how Tower Of Fantasy, which released two weeks ago, is already teasing its first piece of additional content. Find a trailer for it below.

                              <span>Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.

Developers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.

                              <span>Nostalgic yet unknown is perhaps a good way to describe OU upon first glance. It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.

The singleplayer spaceship shooter hit Game Pass in June, and all you need to know is: once you power through the boring bit, you get to play as a spacewitch pilot who fights with guns and magic while weaving through the innards of battleships and megastructures. It&#x27;s one of those good 7/10 games.

You can now fly over Hanover, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Cologne. They’re rendered with the fancy photogrammetry technique that’s already plonked hundred of cities into Flight Simulator’s rendition of Earth. 


That means that you can zoom over Koelnmesse, which is where Gamescom’s happening right bloomin’ now. Nice bit of Inception-style weirdness there, Microsoft Flight Simulator devs. I’ll give it a go later and see if I can spot our roving reporter Ed. Witness the realism for yourself by watching the trailer below, like some kind of human aircraft gliding above.

David Braben said that Frontier Developments incorporate audio from projects such as the British Antactic Survey’s Halley Research Station, which is where the data was collected that revealed that classic environmental disaster, the hole in the ozone layer. Braben’s revelation was prompted by the recent public acknowledgement from NASA that, yes, people really can hear screams in space. Sort of.

                              <span>This week on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast we give thanks to listener Tom Fakelastname, who emailed in to ask us about the moral quandaries in video games that we feel are the most meaningful. Matthew isn&#x27;t here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. 
Because there&#x27;s no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.

                              <span>Revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Atlas Fallen is an upcoming action RPG being developed by Deck 13 Interactive, the folks behind The Surge games. It&#x27;s eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.
I managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it&#x27;s shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I&#x27;ve got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.

                              <span>Valve have revealed that daily reservations of the Steam Deck are higher than at any time since the handheld launched in February this year. The official Steam Deck Twitter account shared the coy stats in a tweet but, as ever, neglected to go into detail about just how many are being snapped up. Good job they’re pumping out more Decks than even Valve expected, at least.

                              <span>&quot;The thing we&#x27;re doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,&quot; explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive&#x27;s smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. 
&quot;What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,&quot; Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It&#x27;s a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it&#x27;s probably the most excited I&#x27;ve been for a Dark Pictures entry.

                              <span>A slice-of-life game about a demon punk rock band having a quarter-life crisis? Dead Pets Unleashed looks exactly like my cup of tea, or rather, a fizzling concoction of Red Bull, battery acid, and popping candy. After launching a Kickstarter campaign, developers Triple Topping have released a Dead Pets Unleashed demo, so players can get a taste of the highs and lows of band life and, after playing the demo myself, it’s definitely worth checking out. You&#x27;ll wanna turn your speakers up for this one.

Now, after the internet noticed the studio is currently hiring for three positions to form a “blockchain team”, developer Build A Rocket Boy have responded to the claims on Reddit. And the answer is... complicated.

                              <span>Feeling proud is a nice sensation isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;ve felt proud a number of times at this year&#x27;s Gamescom so far, marked first by an excellent McDonald&#x27;s choice (honey crisp chicken and bacon) on the first evening, followed by a doner kebab that put it to shame. And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.
The bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we&#x27;d accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.

Last night also saw the reveal of the Samsung 990 Pro SSD, a premium designed-for-gaming drive with read speeds up to 7450MB/s – nudging the theoretical limits of its PCIe 4.0 interface. If it actually reaches such speeds in the wild, once it launches in October, that would make it the fastest consumer PCIe 4.0 drive yet. And write speeds aren’t far behind either, at up to 6900MB/s.

                              <span>Popular stream-ripping site Yout.com finds itself blocked again by Peruvian ISPs. Just a few months ago the service protested a similar blockade. The Government isn&#x27;t easily defeated though, as it simply requested another temporary blockade, pending an investigation. And while the formal deadline has passed, getting the blockade lifted is easier said than done.

                              <span>The Case Of The Golden Idol is a detective game in which you explore 2D scenes of grisly murders. As you click around, you&#x27;ll discover new words to add to your inventory, which you can then use to fill in your explanation of the crime. How did who get into whose room, which person was killed, and how did the murder take place? 

These are the sorts of questions you&#x27;ll be answering across 12 different murders - and there&#x27;s a demo available now, if you want to start to work the case right away.

Original story:
Off The Grid was announced earlier this year, the first product of District 9 director Neill Blomkamp&#x27;s partnership with Gunzilla Games. A new video released tonight offers a longer look at its setting, in the form of a Blomkamp directed in-engine cinematic, while also giving a sense of how the cyberpunk battle royale might feel to play. Watch it below.

Floodland, the newly announced survival settlement builder about building back better after climate collapse, is much more interesting to me because the roofs are bright blue, the walls are daubed in orange, the tents are luscious shades of mauve and heliotrope. Watch it below to see what I mean.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a pretty mechanical keyboard, but usually the keebs I&#x27;m most enamoured with have price tags to match - think £100 to £200 minimum, and think the upper end of that scale if you want a keyboard that looks like a giant ice cube or weighs a solid 2.3kg. Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures Anthology returns this November with The Devil In Me, which serves as the season finale for the franchise (until the next batch of games arrive). A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.
The Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. 


The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. You can get a better sense of the game&#x27;s narrative by watching this recent story trailer.</span>

                              <span>If you enjoy over-the-top, stylish action games with plenty of silliness, Wanted: Dead should be on your radar. First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it&#x27;s little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. 
The story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. 


Wanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

I love Minecraft and have been playing it on and off since it landed on Xbox Live Arcade in 2012, but I couldn’t care less about the series’ spin-off games like Dungeons or the Telltale-developed Story Mode. While those games were fine, they defeated the point of why I love Minecraft – building, and crafting. 
Developer Mojang Studios is shaking things up with its next spin-off, and after my behind-closed-doors demo at Gamescom, I’m interested. 


Minecraft Legends is a third-person real-time action strategy game. Yeah, that’s a lot of keywords, but I promise the game is easier to understand than you think…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

                              <span>Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game&#x27;s art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You&#x27;ll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.</span>

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …</span>

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.
During my 75-minute hands-on session, I was able to check out the…</span>

This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm &quot;Armothy&quot; and the &quot;Plumbus&quot; all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


&quot;Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Morty&#x27;s moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm &#x27;Armothy&#x27; and &#x27;Plumbus&#x27; all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles.&quot;
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.

                              <span>Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn&#x27;t find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!
