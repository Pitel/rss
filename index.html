MAR10 always brings with it a whole host of Mario-themed fun. And last night, the voice cast of The Super Mario Bros. Movie got together on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with The Roots to perform an awesome acapella rendition of the Super Mario Bros. Theme.
This delightful little cover features the voice talents of the movie all singing along to the iconic video game theme in one of Fallon&#x27;s semi-regular segments, which have previously featured the cast of The Force Awakens, coaches from the reality show The Voice, and the animated characters from the movie Sing. A;; framed by the NES pixel art from the 1985 NES game from both the Overworld and the Underground.

                              <span>Shanghai Surprise?
Arrowiz, the Shanghai-based development team behind 2021&#x27;s Hermitage: Strange Case Files, returns to Nintendo Switch with a determined attempt to replicate the general rhythm and vibe of Atlus&#x27; all-conquering Persona series in the form of Mato Anomalies. This is an RPG that throws a whole bunch of ideas and gameplay mechanics at the player but, unfortunately, it all comes unstuck due to clunky writing, uninspiring combat mechanics and environmental design that quickly becomes repetitive.
Thrown into a neo-futuristic Shanghai cityscape pulled straight out of the likes of Blade Runner, players assume the role of two protagonists: Doe, a hard-boiled private detective who deals in out-thinking his adversaries, and Gram, his mysterious exorcist sidekick who gets to do all the fighting. Working as a team, the duo set out to investigate a series of strange anomalies affecting the city, bringing them face to face with demonic entities known as the Bane Tide.

Game Freak and Nintendo rolled out a new update for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet a few weeks ago. And while it did come with some new stuff, it also seemed to create a number of issues.
In response to this, The Pokémon Company has now announced it will be distributing a new update at the end of next month. As explained by Serebii.net, it&#x27;ll fix some of the bugs tied to eggs. Here&#x27;s the rundown:

The 3DS and Wii U eShops are shutting down at the end of this month, and ahead of this, lots of game developers have been slashing prices on their libraries across both platforms. Capcom is the latest to do this - with an absolutely massive sale currently taking place on Nintendo&#x27;s slightly older digital storefronts at the moment.
You can get 3DS titles like Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, older Phoenix Wright games, Resident Evil entries and even Street Fighter for just $2.99 USD. The same pricing applies on the Wii U eShop - with games like DuckTales: Remastered and Resident Evil Revelations also going for this amount.

                              <span>A look at what&#x27;s ahead for Capcom
The Capcom Spotlight 2023 has come and gone, and the company&#x27;s locked in what looks like the next few months of its publishing slate. From Resident Evil 4 to Mega Man and Ghost Trick, there were a lot of dates locked in for the next few months.
Today really seemed to focus on setting out a release calendar for Capcom heading into the summer. Some got new release dates, while others with known dates got a few new tidbits of information. There was nothing outright brand-new, but it was still solid to see the schedule rolled out for the next few months of Capcom titles. And honestly, they look pretty alright to me.

As part of this afternoon&#x27;s Capcom Spotlight live stream, we got to see a new blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss it teaser for Resident Evil: Death Island, the CGI animated movie currently in production at Sony Pictures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tUTrBXdVPAE&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;ONEMedia
The new teaser revealed that veteran hero Jill Valentine will be joining Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield on their latest volley against the undead. The narrative of the film will the Resident Evil protagonists cross paths as their respective missions lead them to the abandoned Alcatraz Island in San Francisco. One can only assume that they&#x27;ll find a lot more to uncover at the haunting prison complex than Clint Eastwood&#x27;s papier mache head.
Resident Evil: Death Island is the next in a growing timeline of CGI films featuring heroes and villains from Capcom&#x27;s survival horror series. Previous releases have included Resident Evil: Degeneration, Resident Evil: Vendetta, and the Netflix series Resident Evil Infinite Darkness. While there is not a specific release date for Death Island, Capcom and Sony are expecting to release the picture at some point in 2023.

Monster hunters on Xbox and PlayStation will finally be able to hop into the latest Monster Hunter Rise content. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak hits Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, as well as the Windows store, on April 28.
While Xbox and PlayStation players were able to hop on earlier this year, they&#x27;ve yet to be able to access the Sunbreak expansion that arrived for Switch and PC via Steam last year.
Sunbreak has already pulled in a hefty number of sales for Monster Hunter Rise, but it&#x27;s good to see other console owners will be able to join in the action too.

There&#x27;s more on the way, too. Several free title updates have already release for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. During today&#x27;s Capcom Spotlight stream, the company also confirmed it will be hosting a digital showcase for Title Update 5 in April, too.
Really, there will always be more monsters to hunt in the world of Monster Hunter. For PlayStation and Xbox players, they&#x27;ll be able to join in the content soon.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak lands on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows on April 28.

                              <span>Discover the truth behind death in June
The stylish Nintendo DS adventure Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective gets its second lease on life this summer. Capcom has locked in a June 30 release date for the Ghost Trick remaster on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam.
Originally released for the DS back in 2010 and brought to the U.S. in 2011, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective was confirmed to be getting an HD remaster last month.
It&#x27;s well-deserved, as Ghost Trick is definitely one of the gems of Nintendo&#x27;s dual-screen handheld. The HD remaster will bring it all to more modern consoles with single screens, with upgraded visuals and sound. That includes new music arrangements by Great Ace Attorney composer Yasumasa Kitagawa, which are fully synchronized with the original music. The Ghost Trick remaster will even let you flip between the new and original music at will, too.
Add on a new gallery of artwork and music for Ghost Trick, and it does seem like the Phantom Detective is getting the historical treatment.

Activate your ghost powers
If you&#x27;ve not seen Ghost Trick before, it follows the soul of Sissel, who wakes up to find he&#x27;s dead. As he unravels the mysteries surrounding his murder, he has to possess and manipulate objects to alter events.
It&#x27;s a quirky, entertaining story with a fair bit of heart. If you dig this era of writing, especially from the Ace Attorney team, this is absolutely one to keep an eye on.
Pre-orders are live now, and Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective hits PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on June 30.

                              <span>Exoprimal reared its scaly head during today’s Capcom Spotlight, revealing a new trailer delving into the game’s bonkers plot and a reveal of a July 14 release date.
A new trailer reveals the game centers on a time-loop, as a team of soldiers travel to the past and find themselves reliving the same day. Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. 


As a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you&#x27;ll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil 4 fans really want to play the upcoming remake later this month, but they can get a jump on it early, thanks to the release of a playable demo. And by “early,” I mean right now.
The demo unfolds within the game’s first chapter, with Leon making his initial trip into the Ganado village. The demo has no time limit and is available on all platforms the game is coming to, which would be PlayStation consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.
The full version of Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24. Check out our coverage hub to enjoy a month&#x27;s worth of in-depth features about the game.</span>

                              <span>With less than a month to go until the theatrical release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo, Illumination, and Universal have released one final trailer to try and catch prospective audience members&#x27; attention. The final trailer came by way of a livestreamed Nintendo Direct featuring the main cast (including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Keegan Michael-Key, Seth Rogen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black), as well as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.
The trailer gives us a more in-depth look at the Mario Kart sequences, which take place on the iconic Rainbow Road course. Along the way, we get Easter eggs, including side-scrolling sequences, shortcuts in Mario Kart courses, and even nods to Bob-omb Battlefield and Tostarena. To coincide with the release of this new trailer (which you can view below), we received a new synopsis of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.
Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nacon Connect presentation, developer Teyon showed off new gameplay of the upcoming RoboCop: Rogue City. The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.
RoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.
You can see the action unfold for yourself below.


Developer Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring &#x27;80s action IP, including 2014&#x27;s Rambo: The Video Game and 2019&#x27;s Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: 
“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”
So there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC. To learn more, be sure to visit our cover story hub for a month’s worth of exclusive features.

                              <span>Wild Hearts gets its first free content updates this month in the form of new Kemono (the game’s term for monsters), quests, and more. Players won’t have to wait long because the first DLC hits tomorrow, March 10. 
On Friday, the Deeply Volatile Kemono Set adds the Hellfire Laharback creature for players to hunt alongside an accompanying quest and a new skill. On March 23, the Subspecies Kemeno Pack goes live, which introduces the wolf-like Grimstalker plus a new quest and new weapon/armor model. This update also adds more higher-difficulty quests, three new emotes, and three chat stamps.
Koei Tecmo also confirmed in a Twitter thread that the first update includes unspecified technical fixes too, and plans to share more specifics tomorrow. A tease for April’s DLC offerings teases new Kemeno, Karakuri, and other updates.
Looks like Wild Hearts fans will have plenty to keep them busy in the immediate future, and the (hopefully) performance improvements, whatever they may be, are a welcomed bonus. To learn more about Wild Hearts, you can read our review here.</span>

                              <span>Trial of Terror
During tonight&#x27;s Capcom Spotlight presentation, it was announced, as rumored, that a special &quot;Chainsaw Demo&quot; for incoming remake Resident Evil 4 is going live today on all platforms — Eager players can download the demo on PS4, PS5, PC (Steam), and Xbox Series X/S.
The demo will give us all a taste of how Capcom is handling the remake of what is not only one of the most beloved titles in the Resident Evil franchise, but one of the most popular titles in gaming history. We will once again step into a mysterious European village with Leon S. Kennedy, as he searches for the missing President&#x27;s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has seemingly been abducted by a strange and mysterious cult.
https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1633968516486373376?s&#x3D;20
The Resident Evil 4 demo will offer up the infamous village assault that opens Leon&#x27;s terrifying adventure. OF course, &quot;Chainsaw Demo&quot; refers to the notorious chainsaw-wielding maniac that attack Leon during this sequence. As opposed to other recent Resident Evil demos, the Chainsaw Demo has no time limit, and can be run and re-run as many times as you wish, scratching that itch ahead of the full game&#x27;s incoming launch. Have fun, and don&#x27;t lose your head.
Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.

                              <span>The Jurassic shooter will be on Xbox Game Pass day one, too
Get ready to deal with some dinos this summer. Capcom has locked in Exoprimal for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on July 14, and it&#x27;s also coming to Xbox Game Pass.
This co-op shooter pits exosuit-adorned soldiers against huge waves of dinosaurs, mixing the horde system you usually see for zombies or Gears&#x27; Locust with prehistoric terrors.
Using different loadouts like Assault, Tank, and Support, the players try to keep the world from being overtaken by the long-gone apex predators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;xLyNU4TlY8A
Alongside the co-op play is a competitive element. Exoprimal pits two teams of five against each other to complete objectives before the other. Story segments will be doled out through playing the Dino Survival mode, as well as various rewards and experiences to juice up your rigs.
Pass to the past
Add in a dash of mutated Neosaurs, that wield elemental powers and more, and it seems kind of interesting. Granted, there are a ton of pre-order rewards and other cosmetics.
Capcom also showed off a good chunk of its Survival Pass, which looks familiar to most battle pass set-ups. There&#x27;s a free track, and a premium track. Picking up a deluxe edition will net you some bonuses too.
An open beta test is also set to run March 17 through 19, so you can get a sense early if you want to dive into Exoprimal. Meanwhile, the full game hits on July 14.

                              <span>What&#x27;re ya streamin&#x27;?
Today, Capcom is airing a special spotlight stream to show off what&#x27;s in store for the company and its upcoming games. Like a merchant rolling out their wares for intrepid special agents, Capcom will simply ask us, &quot;what&#x27;re ya buyin&#x27;?&quot;
The Capcom Spotlight 2023 will go live at 2:30 p.m. PT / 5:30 p.m. ET. You can follow along through Twitch, YouTube, or other video platforms. Even TikTok, I guess, if you want to stitch the spotlight or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;pR6WYjw5mlU
Capcom&#x27;s Spotlight is expected to run for 26 minutes and will contain information about its upcoming games, including some not suitable for children. Sorry little Timmy, no Resident Evil for you just yet.
What can we expect?
Already named among today&#x27;s featured virtual programming are Resident Evil 4 Remake and the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Some might argue that&#x27;s really all you need in your gaming life.
For those who still want more info, though, there are plenty of games for Capcom to talk about. Exoprimal and Street Fighter 6 both seem like candidates, even though we just got a new fighter drop for the latter. And there are plenty of tiny updates Capcom could hit, whether for VR adaptations or long-tail games like Monster Hunter.
Part of me does hope for just a small hint of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma II, though that may be a bit too far off to discuss now. Either way, we can at least expect some Resident Evil updates and Mega Man news today. Let us know your thoughts down below!

After a strong showing at a recent Nintendo Direct, Level-5 hosted a livestream today spotlighting some of its upcoming titles. Though every title was already known, we did get some details on what looks like a packed line-up for Level-5.
Today&#x27;s stream featured the reveal of a new Megaton Musashi, dubbed Megaton Musashi: Wired. Alongside the mech action title, we also got some details on the new Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, the cop RPG Decapolice, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, and the new Professor Layton game.

Team Ninja has released an update for its recently released adventure Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty — Available now on PlayStation and PC, Version 1.03 takes a first pass at several issues bugging players on both platforms.
First and foremost, the new update tackles camera control problems that have been a frustration for many PC players, especially those playing on mouse &amp; keyboard. An additional fix improves support for various graphics cards, and eliminates an issue that was rendering some resolutions unselectable. On both platforms, minor tweaks allow guest players to skip cutscenes, so you won&#x27;t be waiting around for your running buddy along with general stability and framerate improvements.
Check out the full patch notes in the tweet below. An Xbox edition of the update will launch &quot;soon&quot;. Team Ninja notes that it will continue to investigate player feedback on the title, with further updates planned for the coming months. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms

                              <span>How far are you willing to go to play Diablo IV early?
Activision Blizzard is teaming up with fried chicken purveyor KFC to help you grease your way into Diablo IV’s upcoming beta on PC and console.
All you need to do to get access to the Diablo IV beta is order a Double Down “sandwich” from KFC.com or their delivery app. No one says you have to eat it. Simply buying the “sandwich” will grant you a code, which you just plug into your Battle.net account. Then, the beta runs from March 17 to March 20. As far as I can tell, this is only for the U.S. I&#x27;m in Canada, and I installed the app for &quot;research purposes,&quot; and the Double Down &quot;sandwich&quot; is not even available.

I love fried chicken. It is my secret weakness, my guilty pleasure, and my forbidden lover. My first child was named “Fried Chicken” until the authorities took them from me. It is doubtlessly the best way to take one of the leaner proteins and turn it into the most delicious filth imaginable. Cultures all over the world have discovered their own way of sucking all the nutrition out of poultry. It’s amazing.
However, KFC was something I really enjoyed when I was a kid (when it was known as Kentucky Fried Chicken), then it went through a huge period of being entirely inedible, and recently I’ve discovered that it’s now decent. It doesn’t hold a candle to Popeye’s, but if I was in a food court when Armageddon arrives and there was only a KFC, I’d die fed but unimpressed.
That’s how you know this isn’t a sponsored article. The offer starts now. Buy your Double Down “sandwich” from the KFC app or KFC.com and get a key for the Diablo IV beta. You’ll get access from March 17 to March 20.

                              <span>The squad is taking more time for launch
DC&#x27;s band of misfits is moving back its release date. A new report from Bloomberg says Warner Bros. has delayed the video game, pushing it from May out to sometime later this year.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was originally planned for 2022, until a delay pushed Rocksteady&#x27;s new DC project into 2023. No official confirmation has happened yet for this delay, and a representative for Warner Bros. did not respond to Bloomberg&#x27;s request for comment. No new date was made clear, either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;y-iZP0Zzhd0
The Suicide Squad game was the focus of a recent Sony State of Play livestream, which showed off some of its story and gameplay, as well as its quite Destiny-like live-service elements. Those aspects were not all warmly received, however. Now, Rocksteady appears to be taking some extra time.
Service squad
No overt reason was mentioned for the delay in Bloomberg&#x27;s report, though it will have to be officially announced soon. The release date, or rather former date, is on May 26 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.
Given the backlash, as well as the fumbles of Gotham Knights, a fellow DC game with live-service elements, I&#x27;m now curious to see what the road ahead for Suicide Squad is. While I&#x27;m not particularly keen on build-crafting my Captain Boomerang loadout the way I would in Destiny, I&#x27;d also wonder what could be addressed at this point in development. We&#x27;ll have to just wait and see what the official Warner Bros. response and reasoning for this delay will be.

During today&#x27;s Nacon Connect live stream, the French publisher released a new gameplay trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City, which is currently in development at Treyon for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.
The new title, representing the first video game adaptation of the RoboCop franchise in many years, will see players mount the leg holster of Alex Murphy, slain in the line of duty and resurrected as The Future of Law Enforcement. The new gameplay clip sees our boy Go Robo through the slums of Old Detroit, where he investigates, (ie decimates), a suspected inner-city drug trafficking operation.

In the clip, we see Murphy note evidence littering the crime scene, before encountering an addict of the city&#x27;s most prominent and des…</span>

Perhaps the crown jewel in Nacon&#x27;s incoming slate is its intriguing adaptation The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which is currently in development at Daedalic Entertainment and scheduled to launch on PC and consoles later in 2023.
The long-in-development title will see players follow the broken-minded Stoor Hobbit on a journey through Middle-Earth, set between the events of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s The Hobbit and his magnum opus, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum will make his way through a variety of legendary locations from the novels, meeting tentative allies and dangerous enemies both new and familiar to fans of Middle-Earth. Gollum will also have to combat his greatest foe, himself, via a mechanic that sees him wrestle with the voices of his own mind for ownership of his very sanity.

We have seen many, many Lord of the Rings-themed video games since Peter Jackson&#x27;s heralded movies brought the franchise back into the zeitgeist of a global audience. With The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, Daedalic is attempting something different, and very ambitious, essentially writing new chapters that take place within the original LOTR timeline, and building a game around a meek, relatively powerless character. Still, it is from unique concepts that we often get head-turning titles.
Following years of delays, it won&#x27;t be too much longer before we find out whether our feeble fiend has what it takes to make his very own adventure... I gotta say it... Precious.
The Lord of The Rings: Gollum launches on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch titles in 2023.

                              <span>Hell on Earth. Moreso.
Fledgling German studio Hekate has released new gameplay footage of its grotesque psychological horror Ad Infinitum, which remains in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Hekate believes that the creepy-looking release will be ready for launch in September of this year.
As we have previously reported, Ad Infinitum is the story of a lone German soldier, lost in the miserable trenches of World War One. Told from a first-person perspective, players will explore a clash of realities, as the true horrors of &quot;The Great War&quot; merge with frightening monstrosities and fantasies that have seemingly become a part of No Man&#x27;s Land. Ad Infinitum will combine stealth, exploration, and puzzle elements as the protagonist picks their way through a living nightmare.

As the first release from Hekate, the studio wishes to make a major impression with its debut. As such, the release date has been pushed back from the second quarter of 2023 to September, which will afford the development team more time to further polish the release ahead of its launch. The team originally conceived the idea over a decade ago, and have worked on it painstakingly for the last three years. As such, it behooves them to make sure that this long-time-coming passion project is the very best that they can make it come launch day.
Ad Infinitum is scheduled to launch in September 2023 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Golly, what a day...
As part of this morning&#x27;s Nacon Connect live stream, the publisher offered up our first look at the gameplay of co-op action adventure Gangs of Sherwood, which is currently in development at Appeal Studios for PC and Gen 9 platforms. It is currently expected to launch in the fall of this year.
As the name suggests, Gangs of Sherwood is a multiplayer adventure set within an alternate, steampunk-style take on the Robin Hood legend. Up to four players will step into the roles of warriors Little John, Friar Tuck, Maid Marian, and, of course, Robin of Loxley himself. The very early gameplay footage sees our band of outlaws battling their way through a castle, with each member of the party bringing bespoke weaponry and fighting skills as they sally forth past a squadron of guards.
The trailer ends with Sherwood Forest&#x27;s finest facing off against a monstrous contraption of flesh and steel, known as &quot;Red Roger of Nottingham&quot;. What is it with Nacon and rusty, aristocratic robots?

While this alpha footage is a tad rough around the edges, I actually really dig the idea of a multiplayer hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash title, and the novel twist on the tales of Robin Hood is a pretty bold concept. I don&#x27;t see any sexy foxes, nor can I hear Brian Adams, so I&#x27;m assuming that this will be a particularly unique adaptation of the Totally Real and Definitely Existed hero. I&#x27;m especially eager to see what form Robin&#x27;s nemesis, The Sheriff of Nottingham, will take in Gangs of Sherwood.
He&#x27;s going to be a massive fucking robot spider, isn&#x27;t he?
Gangs of Sherwood is scheduled to launch this fall on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. You can check out an extended gameplay preview over on the official Steam store page.

                              <span>Yoshi&#x27;s Island is a new favorite of mine
Okay, so I have to admit this upfront: I adore the Yoshi&#x27;s Island series. Destructoid legend Jordan Devore and I would discuss this franchise constantly, and nearly every conversation ended in: &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s real good.&quot; It&#x27;s just a natural conclusion. Well, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe just dropped a track tailor-made for us in Yoshi&#x27;s Island, part of the newest Wave 4 DLC. Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great.

The layout is breezy and unique without being too much
Some Mario Kart tracks can employ a semi-convoluted track layout, which doesn&#x27;t always gel with the folks who pick up and play with me casually. But so far, Yoshi&#x27;s Island has been a big hit with pretty much everyone. I&#x27;ve raced with.

I spend a lot of time wrapped up in my own head, so I’m familiar with the landscape. However, I’m still learning how to deal with all the mess. Therapy helps, but sometimes looking at things from another perspective can make sense of things. 2019’s Figment tried to do just that by casting you as Dusty, the mind’s courage, and having him explore an addled brain.
Figment was not a solid click for me. It had an easy-to-appreciate aesthetic, featuring wonderful art and enjoyable music. It also had an obvious passion for pushing it forward and upward. There was a noticeable cohesion to the whole project, making it feel like everything it could be. However, it was lacking something I’m having difficulty describing. Here goes:
Figment doesn’t have enough chew.

If you&#x27;ve ever watched the Pokemon anime, you&#x27;re probably used to seeing cheeky antics, and more mischievous Pokemon who don&#x27;t actually want to get crammed into that itty bitty living space trainers call Pokeballs. But seeing it play out in the heavily orchestrated games is just amazing.
Reddit user sentrous shared a recent anecdote (with video!) on how they attempted to open up their kid&#x27;s copy of Pokemon Violet to help them fill up their Pokedex. Sweet, right? Well, the Sliggo that popped out, presumably in follow mode, made a run for it. The below video is smile-worthy at minimum, as the Sliggo just completely makes a break for it (the trainer looking ominously at us at the end just makes it). Of course they&#x27;re not lost forever (it would be kind of funny it they were), and folks are using this opportunity to talk about the time their personal Pokemon similarly ran off a cliff (and miraculously survived).
A &quot;bounty PVP flag/Ultimate Online&quot; type FFA Pokemon MMO world would be wild to see. Imagine fighting over Pokemon pink slips! It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how all the Pokemon act in the new iteration of the anime, which is playing out sans Ash. The captain-hat Pikachu is especially intriguing to me, as it&#x27;ll take me quite a bit of time to get used to a Pikachu in-universe that&#x27;s not the sweet protagonist Pikachu we&#x27;ve known and loved for years. Maybe there&#x27;s room for the Scarlet &amp; Violet cast to get a little fiesty!

                              <span>Return to the Rune Factory this September
Marvelous and XSEED have locked in a launch date for the remastered Rune Factory 3 Special. This updated version of the Rune Factory 3 heads to Nintendo Switch and PC on September 5, 2023.
Special is a remastered version of the original Rune Factory 3, with updated graphics and redesigned character models. The original was released on Nintendo DS back in 2009, the update looks to bring Rune Factory 3 Special visually in line with the other updated farming game, Rune Factory 4 Special. You can see the new visuals at work in today&#x27;s trailer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Se3TvrFQgXY
Alongside the updated look, there&#x27;s been some new features added as well. There&#x27;s the Newlywed Mode, which is unlocked after you&#x27;ve married one of  the 11 eligible candidates in town and opens up some standalone adventures. There&#x27;s also a &quot;Hell&quot; difficulty level, meant to challenge veteran players. Can&#x27;t say I dream about heading off to a farm and tending it on &quot;Hell&quot; mode, but to each their own.
Fantasy farming life
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the series, Rune Factory is a farming life series in the same vein as Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons and Stardew Valley. It usually sets itself apart, though, with a more fantasy setting and RPG mechanics. While you do farm, you&#x27;ll also get into long story sequences and dive into dungeons. For a more recent comparison, Square Enix&#x27;s Harvestella felt like a game made in a similar vein.
Rune Factory 3 was generally well-received at the time, and for series fans, having a refreshed entry is neat. It still feels like we&#x27;re in a swell of farming games though, so we&#x27;ll see how Rune Factory 3 Special fares in a more crowded genre later on this year.

Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is the big game this week according to Nintendo, and we have a review for it! Mask of the Lunar Eclipse released in Japan on the Wii in 2008, and Goichi Suda himself is the co-director alongside of series steward Makoto Shibata. I really want to check this one out eventually as a long-time fan of the Fatal Frame franchise.
Beyond that, there&#x27;s Oni: Road to be the Mightiest Oni, and Figment 2: Creed Valley. Oh, and a ton of other stuff below. The next big thing up for Nintendo is Bayonetta Origins, which is due on March 17.

                              <span>No more errant notifications
With Nintendo continuing their ascent into the online world, there&#x27;s bound to be snafus every so often: especially with first party games. Splatoon 3 had one minor issue pop up recently, and it involved friend lists.
The popular &quot;ghosting&quot; or &quot;appear offline&quot; feature has been standard in PC games/PC platforms for many years, but consoles were slower to the take. While the feature exists now on major platforms, it doesn&#x27;t always go as planned. In Splatoon 3&#x27;s case, some users were reporting that notifications would be sent to their friends, despite the fact that they had their public appearance settings locked down to &quot;best friends only,&quot; or &quot;share my status with no one.&quot;
As of this week, that should be fixed now thanks to patch 3.0.1. I told you it was a minor update! Either way if this was happening to you, breathe easy.
Splatoon 3 Version 3.0.1 - Released March 8, 2023 (Full patch notes)
Fixes to Notifications
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused notifications to be sent to a user’s friends, even if that friend’s system Friend Settings were set to only display their online status to “Best Friends” or “No One.”

If a user and their friends are connected to the same Pool, notifications will continue to display regardless of their Friend Settings.
Note: Compatible with Ver. 3.0.0 battle replays. Not compatible with Ver. 2.1.1 or earlier battle replays.

                              <span>The back door to the Front Mission
Forever Entertainment has dropped a demo for their Front Mission 1st: Remake on Nintendo Switch.
The demo will give you a small taste of the game, with the full tutorial and two missions from the OCU campaign. You’ll also be able to test your builds in the arena. Modern and classic gameplay modes are available, but most importantly: you can carry your save from the demo over to the full game.
https://youtu.be/A7B09x2Bq8A
I feel like demos are really ineffective for strategy games and RPGs, however if you’re on the fence about whether the Front Mission 1st: Remake’s mech strategy will fit your tastes, it will give you some idea. At the very least, it’s a good way to check out the game’s performance and visuals to see if you can tolerate them.
On the other hand, you can read my review. Or just take my word for it: Yes, Front Mission 1st: Remake is a great time. It has its weaker spots, but I think it’s a great little strategy game. I’m really looking forward to the Front Mission 2 Remake.
Front Mission 1st: Remake is available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. You can now try out the demo before dropping $34.99 on the full version.

It’s amazing to think that developer Love-de-Lic only released three titles that stayed in their native homeland of Japan. Despite its flash of existence, the company’s design philosophy has long outlived it. Chulip, Chibi-Robo, and even Tingle’s Freshly Picked Rosy Rupeeland all subscribe to this philosophy of trying to solve people’s problems. Joy-makers, I call them, and there really isn’t enough of them in the world.
24 Killers wears its influence on its sleeve. Its deliberately uneven visual style even harkens back to Love-de-Lic’s first title, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. That puts it in a tricky predicament because it invites direct comparisons. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, but 24 Killers has been training hard and doing its squats.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe just got its fourth wave of DLC this week, and with it, patch notes! Don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;re mostly good news.
In addition to adding support for the DLC, there&#x27;s also a series of general improvements, as well as myriad issues that have been fixed. Thankfully, unlike many other first part Nintendo patch notes, those fixes are descriptive! If you&#x27;ve been having problems with items (like the Boo and lightning glitches), you&#x27;re in luck. As for the general patch smoothing, there&#x27;s &quot;improved performance&quot; of select characters and vehicle parts, and you can now utilize the rear view mirror in more cases (including spinning, crashing, and when you&#x27;re morphing into a Bullet Bill).

                              <span>Based on the new character select screen after the latest update
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass Wave 4 (read: more DLC tracks and Birdo) dropped this week, and with it, plenty of speculation and intrigue.
After booting the update up and navigating through the menus to try out the new tracks, I noticed something odd: there&#x27;s five &quot;?&quot; spots on the character select screen that didn&#x27;t appear before! This is in addition to Birdo, who made their debut in Wave 4.
Interestingly, instead of rearranging the character select screen, Birdo appears in a brand new column, with five more slots below them denoted by a &quot;?&quot; With the Mario universe as vast as it is at this point, the realm of speculation is probably limitless, as any character, no matter how small (Goombas!) could show up. Note that there are two more waves to go until these five slots are potentially filled; and of course, this might not be the definitive end of all DLC for the game.
Who could the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC characters be?
Just based on a few racers that have appeared in other games, there&#x27;s a short list:
Funky Kong (Mario Kart Wii/Tour)
Diddy Kong (Double Dash/Wii/Tour)
Honey Queen (Mario Kart 7)
Wiggler (Mario Kart 7)
Petey Piranha (Double Dash/Tour)
This list also isn&#x27;t exhaustive, and Nintendo could surprise us with out-of-left-field characters like they did with the Animal Crossing Villager and Link from the Zelda series. I can also see Pauline making it in by the end, especially given her appearance in Mario Golf: Super Rush. The sky is the limit when you&#x27;re a character factory like Nintendo!

It looks like Capcom&#x27;s previously teased Resident Evil 4 demo will be with us by sundown. At least that&#x27;s the word going around on Twitch, where a pop-up ad appears to have jumped the gun a little bit early.
According to Twitch users, a new ad for the upcoming remake has been frequently popping up on the streaming service, emblazoned with the words &quot;Demo Available Now&quot;. Given that Capcom has a live stream showcase planned for later today featuring Resident Evil 4, it seems to be a snug assumption that the demo will drop in tandem, likely across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The tweet below features the ad, as spotted by fans @Jbiootyful and @DanisabeastXD. Lordy.
https://twitter.com/DanisabeastXD/status/1633710601271664640?s&#x3D;20
The Capcom Spotlight showcase kicks off at 14:30 PT / 17:30 ET / 23:30 BST, with a brief pre-show scheduled 15 minutes beforehand. You will be able to check out the live stream for yourself over on the official Capcom YouTube and Twitch channels, where we are expected to hear updates on futuristic dinosaur battle Exoprimal, monster... erm... hunter Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, as well as new info pertaining to Mega Man Battle Network, and, obviously, Resident Evil 4 itself.
We’ll be sure to bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid.

Inti Creates has announced that it will be retitling its recently released platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge as Gal Guardians: Demon Purge in all English-speaking countries. The action-packed Gothic adventure will be briefly removed from storefronts while the name change takes place.
The need to pull the ol&#x27; switcheroo comes in response to a legal claim from the owners of fantasy franchise Grimguard — a series that utilizes the similar sounding name for its range of tabletop and mobile titles. It&#x27;s no doubt a frustrating situation for Inti Creates, but given the Demon Purge is part of the Gal Gun series, the name change is still a snug fit.

Released last month on PC and consoles, Grim... Sorry, Gal Guardians: Demon Purge is a metroidvania-like title that weighs in a little heavier on the arcade action over the RPG elements. As noted in our review, it offers dynamic and engaging co-op action, punctuated with good humor, and dressed up in lovely pixel art and a cool, Castlevania-lite soundtrack. For fans of the classic Konami series, as well as SNES aficionados everywhere, it&#x27;s definitely worth checking out.
Gal Guardians: Demon Purge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. A physical edition is also in the works, though no doubt it will now be delayed while the artwork is changed to reflect the new title.

                              <span>Special Starfield presentation will follow
Microsoft has announced that it will be holding its next major Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday, June 11, timed with the launch of this year&#x27;s E3 2023 festivities.
The date was revealed in a tweet from the publisher, promoting a special presentation for Bethesda&#x27;s epic space opera Starfield. The Bethesda presentation is scheduled to take place immediately after the Xbox showcase, so it looks like there&#x27;s a full evening of Xbox-centric news, updates, and reveals set for that particular evening.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1633485273446375424?s&#x3D;20
Starfield, which Bethesda is hoping will be a genuine sci-fi adventure for the ages, has been bouncing around the calendar for the past two years, before receiving a new release date of September 6 in an announcement made by the studio&#x27;s own Todd Howard yesterday. The team is promising a massive-scale exploration of stars and planets, bolstered by the power of Gen 9 technology.
Of course, when E3 rolls around, Destructoid will be right here bringing you all of the news from what is likely to be a seemingly endless rollout of live streams, press conferences, floor demos, and stage presentations. E3 2023 is scheduled to take place Tuesday, June 13 - Friday, June 16.

Well folks, we have now seen the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, what did you think? Not that full of surprises, huh? You know what was a surprise, though? The final reveal that a replica model of Mario&#x27;s boots from the movie will soon be appearing at New York&#x27;s Nintendo Store. A model. Of Mario&#x27;s boots.
Yep. After revealing the final trailer and seeing some classic forced interaction from the lead cast, Miyamoto made the unexpected announcement that a new movie promo will be appearing at the NY store in the shape of Mario&#x27;s boots. If you find yourself in the area, you can stop by and see them from tomorrow (10th March), what better way is there to celebrate MAR10 Day, after all?

And there you have it, folks — the final trailer for Illumination&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. Movie has aired, and once again is packed full of references and laced with tons of action.
In today&#x27;s dedicated Mario Movie Nintendo Direct, Shigeru Miyamoto and CEO of Illumination Chris Meledandri introduced the very last trailer before the movie launches in cinemas on 5th April (depending on where you live, it could be earlier!). All six of the main actors also featured in some typical Hollywood banter.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.

Across 19 mainline games and a handful of spinoffs, the Hero of Time has taken on a variety of forms. The changes between each have ranged from the subtle (Skyward Sword&#x27;s eyeliner or A Link to the Past&#x27;s pink hair) to the pretty &quot;wait... what?&quot; drastic (come on guys, he&#x27;s literally turned into a wolf), but he&#x27;s still the same old Link at heart, right?
Wrong! No matter which way you spin it, some Links are just cooler than others. Be it their unique swanky outfits, luscious golden locks, or freaky abilities, most games in the mainline Zelda series force us to think, &quot;yeah, this hero&#x27;s cool, but he&#x27;s not as cool as...&quot;

Forever Entertainment has announced that a free demo for Front Mission 1st: Remake is now available to download from the Switch eShop.
Released back in November 2022, Front Mission 1st: Remake took the original SNES classic and revitalised it with refreshed visuals for modern platforms. That said, we weren&#x27;t overly keen on it in our review, noting that combat can quickly become a tiresome slugfest with weapons that are too random in their targets and damage.

The latest Japanese charts are now in from Famitsu and it is once again all about Kirby (thanks, Gematsu). For the second week in a row Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe has triumphed over the competition, selling 62,581 copies this time around — not quite the 189,931 that we saw last week, but respectable nonetheless.
It has been another strong showing from Nintendo this week too, with the Switch being represented by seven of the top ten chart entries. Alongside the usual suspects of Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Octopath Traveler II continued to sell well (shifting 14,085 and landing in seventh place this time), and Metroid Prime Remastered just about managed to sneak into the standings in its market debut, selling 7,960 copies.

                              <span>Spells trouble.
Even in a magical fantasy setting, nothing good comes from war. The Last Spell, a roguelite that mixes tactical RPG and tower defense elements, is set in a world that has already been destroyed by mankind’s thirst for destruction. With this unique blend of genres, the game offers up some fun and engaging gameplay mechanics, but despite its pixel art style, the Switch port is certainly not without its issues.
In The Last Spell, the action starts after a powerful group of mages have unleashed total annihilation upon the world, releasing swarms of demons that have reduced humanity to a handful of small havens. Every night, a few heroes defend these cities as the remaining mages attempt to undo the evil they have wrought by banishing all magic from the world. It isn’t an overly complex setup and the actual gameplay doesn’t feel nearly as dark as the opening cutscene makes it out to be, but the premise is a solid one.

Footage of an official LCD screen for the GameCube from E3 2002 has been discovered. The footage has been shared by Adam Doree on YouTube, a media executive who has been in the industry for over 25 years and has worked at IGN, Ziff Davis, Mashable, Segaweb, Gamerweb, and Kikizo (via Eurogamer, Go Nintendo).
Doree has dug through the archives to discover this never-before-seen footage of the GameCube&#x27;s lost LCD Monitor from an E3 show over 20 years ago. He believes this footage is &quot;probably the only surviving footage&quot; of the LCD Monitor.

The presentation focused on five titles from the Japanese developer, with a big surprise at the end — every single title in the presentation will be released worldwide in either 2023 or 2024.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is back with Wave 4 (of six) of the Booster Course Pass tracks, this time covering the Fruit Cup and Boomerang Cup. Now that we’re over the halfway point, it really feels like Nintendo is starting to kick things into high gear with not only a stellar set of new and returning tracks but also an extra character in the form of Birdo. It all adds up to what is easily the strongest DLC release so far.
Starting with the Fruit Cup first, here you’ve got Amsterdam Drift from Mario Kart Tour, Riverside Park from GBA, DK’s Snowboard Cross from Wii, and the brand new Yoshi’s Island course. Amsterdam Drift, is arguably the strongest of the tracks from Tour, sending you soaring through the air against a backdrop of farmland and windmills before you’re cruising on the bed of the Amstel River. It looks so nice.

This review originally went live in 2014, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s GBA library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Released a full eight years after its phenomenal Super Nintendo predecessor, Super Metroid, 2002&#x27;s Metroid Fusion is a well-paced, tense, atmospheric game and an oft-overlooked GBA classic that, while not as substantial and expansive as other 2D games in the series, suits portable play beautifully.

Developer Level-5 has just revealed more details on Professor Layton and the New World of Steam as a part of the &#x27;Level-5 Vision&#x27; showcase.
Alongside announcing that the Japanese voice cast will see Yo Oizumi returning as Hershel Layton alongside Mio Amada as Luke&#x27;s new voice, the developers announced that puzzle design duties would be taken on by QuizKnock. Perhaps best known for their YouTube channel in Japan, QuizKnock is a group that specialises in puzzle and riddle content and will be designing a fresh batch of original head scratchers for the latest game in the series.

                              <span>&quot;Literally every single person in this movie is great&quot;.
Ever since it was initially announced, we have all been curious as to how Nintendo and Illumination would go about bringing the world of Mario to the big screen. From The Super Mario Bros. Movie trailers that we have seen so far, it certainly seems like they have done a good job. The movie iterations of the characters have just enough in common with the video games that we know where we stand, but there are some fun twists in there to keep things interesting.
This process of bringing the iconic characters from game to screen was touched on by one of the movie&#x27;s directors, Michael Jelenic, in a recent interview with Animation Magazine (thanks, Go Nintendo). Jelenic was glowing in his praise for the movie&#x27;s cast, who he stated had the tough job of bringing life to the video game characters who &quot;don&#x27;t have much of a personality&quot;.

It now has a story trailer, as of this evening&#x27;s Nacon Connect, but the third-person stealth &#x27;em up once again impresses mostly in terms of its headgear.

Then it was confirmed that the third-person supervillain adventure required an always online internet connection. The response to both these reveals was not great.

Now a report by Bloomberg cites an anonymous source who says Suicide Squad has been delayed until later in the year.

Previously, Epic had their own internal curation process for publishing to the store, but this changes from today, with developers now having much more control over getting their games onto the EGS. Well, almost.

                              <span>I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).
Figment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment&#x27;s surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.

You&#x27;ll have to listen to find out). In games we seem to accept that a series running for decades, over many, many sequels, is just kind of normal. What&#x27;s the deal with that? Would games be better without sequels? Who knows? Us. We do. We talk about it today.

                              <span>When Capcom showed off their latest Resident Evil 4 remake trailer the other week, they promised a playable demo would be coming ahead of the game&#x27;s launch on March 24th. At the time, no date was given for when the demo might be arriving, but thanks to some seemingly early Twitch ads doing the rounds today, it would appear that Resi 4 demo will be coming later today - presumably once Capcom&#x27;s Spotlight Showcase stream has wrapped up this evening. Here&#x27;s hoping it will also be available on PC, and not just PlayStation this time.

There are 32 games in the line-up this year, which will be highlighted in a series of online and in-person events running from March 29th to April 8th.

                              <span>Far be it from me to get excited about games that have just been announced, but the reveal trailer for Galacticare has slapped this management game right onto the old radar. An intergalactic radar, in fact, because this is a hospital management game - in spaaaaace! - coming later this year. It&#x27;s from a Brighton-based indie studio called Brightrock Games, and it sort of looks like Theme Hospital with a space skin, or Startopia with a hospital sim. Neither option is a bad thing, in my opinion.

                              <span>I will take to my grave the belief that building your own PC is a worthwhile, even pleasurable, endeavour. Besides the fact that it’s cheaper than buying an equivalent, prebuilt gaming rig, the DIY PC approach gives you more control over its components, teaches you skills you can later apply when upgrading or troubleshooting, and perhaps most importantly, isn’t anywhere near as difficult as it looks. Especially if you have a convenient, step-by-step guide to building a PC to hand. Incidentally…

                              <span>Clash: Artifacts Of Chaos is nails, mate. And that&#x27;s coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja&#x27;s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that&#x27;s mighty good at grinding people into paste. I&#x27;m not trying brag; I&#x27;m being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash&#x27;s third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck&#x27;s signature grimace on my face.
Aside from being really difficult, I&#x27;m a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I&#x27;ve played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It&#x27;s at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren&#x27;t all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.

                              <span>The Crucial MX500 is one of the best gaming SSDs in the SATA category in my books, right alongside the legendary Samsung 870 Evo. That&#x27;s because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. 
Today, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded.

                              <span>As promised last year, Halo Infinite’s season 3 update has arrived with a new ray tracing option for us PC folks. Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.
Granted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.

Publisher Chucklefish today announced Wargroove 2 in partnership with Pathway devs Robotality. There’s no date set for Wargroove 2’s release, but it’ll launch on PC and Switch whenever it’s ready.

                              <span>The first time I glimpsed The Finals&#x27; bonkers environmental destruction (some might say &quot;levelutions&quot;) last August, I couldn’t quite believe it was real. But it is real, and you can play it today. Following its closed alpha last September, the first-person shooter is now having a closed beta test for the next two weeks, and you can join the mayhem simply by requesting access on Steam.

                              <span>&quot;Have a go of Sons Of The Forest,&quot; my compatriots at RPS told me. &quot;It&#x27;s a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!&quot; And I was like, &quot;wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What&#x27;s going on here?&quot;
Thus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

                              <span>Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I&#x27;ve spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game&#x27;s live service cogs to determine whether it&#x27;s running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.
And you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it&#x27;s a decent time that&#x27;s perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won&#x27;t attract players who are done with the usual rise &#x27;n grind demands of these sorts of games.

                              <span>Last month, Riot Forge announced their latest spin-off would launch sometime this Spring. We now have an April 18th release date for The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story, alongside an snazzy trailer that’s bursting with sick 2D pixel art, outrageous magical abilities, and a few lore teases. The action RPG comes from developer Digital Sun, the folks behind Moonlighter, the roguelike shopkeeping-sim hybrid.

Talking about all our favourite games would take us into 3023, so we’ve kept it to two games per person, which actually wasn’t as hard as we thought it would be.

Even more interesting is that it&#x27;s coming from Turnfollow, an indie team best known for wonderful little story games like Little Party and Wide Ocean Big Jacket. Huh! Life sims are not my genre but I really like Turnfollow&#x27;s games, so I&#x27;m in. Check out the announcement trailer below for a small taste of this sci-fi life.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two have confirmed layoffs at the company, primarily affecting their corporate and publishing efforts. The news originally spilled yesterday via a Tweet from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who claimed the cuts would impact Private Division - the publishing label behind The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program 2 - and other unnamed divisions. Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”

If you hunger for something more concrete about how it might differ from its predecessor, as I do, then you might be interested in an apparently leaked list of achievements that contains details of disasters, weather, embiggened map sizes and more.

                              <span>Bill Omar Carrasquillo, better known online as Omi in a Hellcat, has been sentenced to 66 months in prison for a number of crimes related to his now-defunct pirate IPTV services. In comments outside a Pennsylvania federal court, Carrasquillo said the judge had been &quot;super lenient but fair&quot; and described the sentence - which includes almost $11m in restitution to several cable companies - as &quot;probably salvation for my fat ass to lose some weight.&quot;

                              <span>A new firmware update hitting the PlayStation 5 today will add Discord voice chat along with other fan-requested features.
The update allows users to link their Discord and PSN accounts to chat with friends through the app. Xbox received the same support last summer, so we’re happy to see it appear on another major platform. You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Additionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer.

                              <span>Starfield, Bethesda&#x27;s mammoth-sized space RPG, is launching on September 6, the publisher announced in a video today. Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. 
In a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a &quot;deep dive&quot; into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. 


Starfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we&#x27;re happy to see the game get a concrete date again. 
Starfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <span>Publisher Chucklefish announced Wargroove 2 today, a sequel to its well-received Advance Wars-inspired strategy RPG. 
Developed by Robotality, Wargroove 2 is set three years after the first game, with a new faction looking to use ancient technology to conquer the now-peaceful land of Aurenia. The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. 


Wargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. 
The first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.</span>

Originally, Bilkins&#x27; Folly was due out on just PC but Webbysoft has added PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch to its list of platforms. A release date has not yet been revealed but the game is due in &quot;late 2023.&quot; In Bilkins&#x27; Folly, you play as treasure hunter Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Bilkins who, with his canine best friend Drayton, embarks on a quest to find their missing family that myseriously vanished years ago. On their journey, the duo will hop islands, solve puzzles, and more.

                              <span>Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 exclusively in Japan. Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary &quot;photo mode&quot; way we are all now familiar with.
This episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.

                              <span>Extraction shooter Escape From Tarkov has been battling cheaters for years, with seemingly mixed results. Developers Battlestate Games are stepping up their efforts not only to ban cheaters but to show other players that &quot;justice has been served&quot;, by releasing the usernames of thousands of players banned for allegedly cheating.

Now though, the same drive is down to £164, a scorching-hot deal for this level of flash-based firepower and one well worth bringing up again!

                              <span>The Light Brigade has no direct relation to the British light cavalry unit made famous in the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (which, if you head over to the poem&#x27;s Wikipedia page, you can hear Tennyson himself read out via a phonograph recording from 1890 – Cool Factz!) But there is one bit of connective tissue, namely that charging into the fray is generally a bad idea. In the case of the game, that&#x27;s because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.

                              <span>Happy birthday, anniversary, launchiversary, or whatever you want to call it to the Steam Deck. Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.


I was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.

                              <span>2020’s Mars Horizon was a space flight management game where you were in charge of constructing bases, building rockets, and leading missions into the black abyss. Nate (RPS in peace) liked it quite a bit for its “masterfully crafted strategic dilemmas,” despite his findom relationship with the game. Now Mars Horizon is getting an expanded sequel, taking us to the outer reaches of the Solar System. Mars Horizon 2: The Search For Life is releasing sometime in 2024 on PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the sort of person that likes the idea of a rural, low-tech lifestyle, where you have a lovely little wooden house and know all your neighbours, and all your food is locally sourced from the farm down the road - but I&#x27;m self-aware enough to know that I&#x27;d hate it in practice. In the case of new town builder Outlanders, I&#x27;d have to share a house with five other people, the farmer just died of old age, and my leader wanders around doing nothing while occasionally issuing edicts forcing me to have children. But at least there&#x27;s a chance of pumpkin pie.

We only have a very brief glimpse at Life By You, but developer Paradox Tectonic and former Sims boss Rod Humble are holding an announcement event on March 20th - so, we’ll see more of the life sim later this month.

Flagship historical grand strategies Crusader Kings 3 and Europa Universalis 4, as well as colony builder Surviving The Aftermath, are all getting expansions.

The movie companies want Reddit to identify several users so they can provide evidence for a lawsuit against Internet provider RCN. Reddit refuses to do so, citing the right to anonymous speech, but the filmmakers suggest that&#x27;s a disingenuous defense.

He declared that accounts engaging in &quot;repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter&quot; will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

Anyone who makes or writes music knows that the path to a complete track isn’t a linear one. It’s a process where instruments weave in and out of the composition on the whim of the person making it. And even when the vision is clear, and you know exactly where you want to take the song, be it behind a drum set, a keyboard, a loop track, or even a computer, things can get in the way. Rytmos, developer Floppy Club’s first non-mobile game, nails that feeling. It uses puzzles to extract the joy, escalation, triumphs, and trials of making music, and it does so with g…</span>

                              <span>Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. 
More specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. 
Check out the game in action in the new trailer below: 


&quot;Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai&#x27;s deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.&quot; 
Riot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector&#x27;s Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas &amp; Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. 

The Mageseeker follows the release of 2021&#x27;s League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer&#x27;s Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence.

Ridiculous, maybe, but these paranoid questions run through my head as Yu climbs a mountain. No safety gear. No helmet. Just his own hands, sneakers, and determination. I have to follow soon after, and though I’m undoubtedly scared, in the moment, I’m much more afraid of killing the creator of Spelunky than my own mortality. Though you could argue, in this hyper-specific example, the game should’ve been a cautionary tale. In Spelunky, you do die a lot. Nevertheless, I don’t want to be responsible for the death of one of the game industry’s most beloved indie developers.

We played the game&#x27;s opening eight hours and spoke with the team&#x27;s creative director, artists, and sound designer and composer (as well as Chrono Trigger composer, Yasunori Mitsuda who is contributing music to the game!) about bringing its fantasy world to life and living up to the quality of the games that inspired it.

The Barcelona, Spain-based studio, which was founded in 2014, will end development on all of its projects as a result of closing its doors in April, as reported by Gematsu. The studio cites unfavorable &quot;economic context&quot; as the reason it&#x27;s shutting down after nine years of development, primarily creating 2016&#x27;s Aragami, its Nightfall DLC, and 2021&#x27;s Aragami 2.

                              <span>Developer The Outsiders has announced the first piece of premium DLC for its critically acclaimed rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger. The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.
The DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn&#x27;t appear on the main game&#x27;s soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.
These updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don&#x27;t purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.
Both of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer&#x27;s &quot;Best Shooter&quot; award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here.

Despite my love for large-scale simulation games like Cities: Skylines as an adult, I was not a SimCity player growing up. Instead, I was pulled in the direction of the more manageable SimTown. The zoomed-in town management, where you can micromanage every aspect of your citizens&#x27; lives without the massive scope of SimCity, always appealed to me more. Perhaps that&#x27;s why Outlanders, a simplistic yet challenging settlement builder, has now sunk its hooks into me on two occasions across both of its platforms.
In this small-scale managem…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve seen 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs under the £100 mark before, but never have we see one for a clear £5 below - and never this model either. The Adata Legend 800 has been steeply discounted at Ebuyer, where £92 plus £3 shipping gets you this new model capable of 3500MB/s reads and 2800MB/s writes.
Yes, this isn&#x27;t the best gaming SSD in terms of raw speed, but its PCIe 4.0 design means that it uses less power and fewer lanes than PCIe 3.0 alternatives of the same speed, a nicety for desktop use and a big deal for laptops.

                              <span>For a long time, Super Auto Pets used a strange and clever (and cheap!) source of artwork for its attacking animals: emojis, scaled up far larger than they appear in WhatsApp messages from your mum. The super auto-battler did eventually start making custom artwork for its later expansions, but much of the furious fauna was still emojis. That has now changed with today&#x27;s patch, going back to replace all the old emojis with new animal pictures. Goodbye, old friends.

                              <span>As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn&#x27;t have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don&#x27;t understand! It&#x27;s disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.
Last week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don&#x27;t have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I&#x27;ve made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.

                              <span>When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. 
In the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. &quot;Arrow to the knee&quot; jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by cute townbuilding, decapitating horror, a demon skateboarding through Hell, bouncing logos, handcrafted strategy, an entire movie jammed into an immersive sim, and more. Come admire these interesting indies!

On the back of reports that Warner may have also canceled the upcoming film Scooby-Doo And Krypto Too!, this weekend the entire movie suddenly leaked online. Warner&#x27;s anti-piracy team is currently attempting to contain the leaks.

The dynamic blocking order sets an important precedent, local anti-piracy outfit Alianza stresses. Blocklist updates are no unnecessary luxury either, as many of the targeted domains were already outdated before the measures went live.

                              <span>Cities: Skylines II was announced at today&#x27;s Paradox Announcement Show, and it’s coming later this year.
This follow-up builds upon its 2015 predecessor with new features, such as fully-realized transportation and economy systems. Paradox didn’t reveal too many other specifics beyond stating in a press release that the game features “ a wealth of construction and customization options and advanced modding capabilities.” Cities: Skylines II is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. Check out the teaser trailer below:


The original game was a big success, having sold over 12 million copies and filling the simulation gap left by SimCity&#x27;s hiatus. Developer Colossal Order has supported it with multiple updates and expansions, including a VR port and a recent current-gen remaster. You can read our original reviews of Cities: Skylines on PC here and the console edition here.</span>

                              <span>Puma has unveiled a new shoe collection inspired by the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
The collaboration will consist of four shoes: two Puma Slipstream models and two RS-X models, as reported by Techraptor. For each model type, there&#x27;s a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There&#x27;s no word on if they&#x27;ll come to the U.S. 
Check out the shoes in the gallery below: 

Each of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. 
Shoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers.

                              <span>Seth Rogen announced in 2020 that he was producing a new animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and today, Paramount Pictures released the first trailer for it...and it looks great!
What&#x27;s especially notable about this trailer is the animation style, which is quite unique for both the TMNT franchise and animation in general. It&#x27;s reminiscent of stop-motion mixed in with the comic-style vibes of Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, although it&#x27;s also very much its own thing.

From permanent teenager @SethRogen, a new generation of heroes will rise...from the sewers.

                              <span>Dead Cells is one of the best roguelites I&#x27;ve ever played and was one of the standout games in the very crowded 2018. However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami&#x27;s dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.
Diving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn&#x27;t help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop. I love discovering secret ar…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. 
Yesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, &quot;Get Ready For Battle&quot; and &quot;A New Sparking Begins&quot; appear on screen. 
Check it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below:

「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ

As you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that&#x27;s what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter&#x27;s built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with &quot;A New Budokai Tenkaichi&quot; begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  
The teaser trailer doesn&#x27;t indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it&#x27;s exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn&#x27;t forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. 
While waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball FighterZ review.

                              <span>Bezpečnostní firma Quarkslab našla dvě zranitelnosti v referenční implementaci TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module). Konkrétně jde o knihovnu Level 00, Revision 01.59 z listopadu 2019. Jde o chyby CVE-2023–1018 a  CVE-2023–1017. Přihlášený lokální útočník může do TPM poslat speciálně upravená data a získat přístup k citlivým datům nebo spustit kód v TPM.</span>

                              <span>I have no problem believing that PowerWash Simulator is as smart and engrossing as people say. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t play it, lest my actual home fall into a state of muck-slick neglect.

                              <span>I had a brief, intense relationship with Vampire Survivors last year, but a steady stream of early access updates and now post-release DLC has kept other players in its thrall for much longer. Those updates have been successful enough that its developer says that they&#x27;d only make a sequel if it offered &quot;something radically new.&quot;

                              <span>Internet provider Grande Communications has asked a Texas federal court to overrule a jury verdict that awarded $47 million in piracy damages to several record labels. If that&#x27;s not an option, the ISP would like to have a new trial. In the event that both options are off the table, Grande plans to appeal the piracy liability case.

This card normally retails closer to £50, with a stated UK RRP of £55, but it has dipped as low as £37.99 for a few days over the past year. 
Still, this is a very reasonable price for a memory card that&#x27;s good for up to 130MB/s sequential reads and meets the A2 requirements for random performance.

                              <span>Last week, I attended a hands-off preview for The Sims 4&#x27;s upcoming Growing Together expansion pack and its supporting free base game update. This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS&#x27; resident Sims fanatic, but I&#x27;ll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn&#x27;t part of the game I engage with too much these days.

With this update installed, you can enable proper, full-fat ray tracing on the Deck for the first time, specifically in Doom Eternal. Neat!

                              <span>Leaks are the bane of every publisher&#x27;s existence, forcing marketing plans to shift, change, or just get scrapped. But that&#x27;s partly why I&#x27;m enjoying EA&#x27;s approach for advertising the Skate. reboot. Footage from the open-world skateboarders’ playtest leaked last September, and EA have since responded by releasing their own janky videos. These clips give us a taste of the whacky ragdolling happening right now, and it&#x27;s probably the most entertaining way of marketing a game while simultaneously sucking the air out of leaks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recommended a pretty wide variety of genres over the years, but I didn&#x27;t expect a brick breaking game to surprise me like Destructure Colon Among Debris. It&#x27;s not that I dislike them. They&#x27;ve just never really made much impression (possibly because I don&#x27;t see all that many)
Destructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with &quot;structures&quot; that aren&#x27;t meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you&#x27;re carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.
Also it feels and sounds great to hit stuff. That&#x27;s probably the bigger reason.

                              <span>I&#x27;m going to Japan in a couple of weeks, and I am beyond excited. It&#x27;s been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I&#x27;m miserable and I&#x27;m staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn&#x27;t want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can&#x27;t wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that&#x27;s been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I&#x27;ll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I&#x27;m going with, will be like, &quot;Get a hold of yourself you buffoon&quot;.
I got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that&#x27;s big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he&#x27;s a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we&#x27;ve arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.

                              <span>In the lead-up to the original Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, the team at Ninja Theory released 30 development diaries, delving deep into every aspect of the game: the art inspirations, the myths they were remixing, and more. It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel&#x27;s setting - and the team&#x27;s painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible. The photogrammartry tech on display is seriously impressive, and following the team to Iceland feels like watching a British travel series, without the crude humour.

A lengthy personal essay about an attract mode clip? Can my cat get a review? First off, yes. Captain Waffles is a visceral tour-de-force that no fan of the genre should miss. 10/10. Secondly, you should know that Immortal Empires is, as far as Total War: Warhammer goes, the game mode. More importantly, this ridiculously expansive, years-spanning grand-strategy project exists as tangible proof that sometimes, the limitless hubris of man is actually rad as hell, despite what the ancient Greeks said. Euripides nuts, more like.

                              <span>Multiplayer horror Dead By Daylight is apparently coming to Hollywood in the form of a new film adaptation. The two production companies involved are longtime horror fixtures Atomic Monster (who have made The Conjuring, Annabelle, and Malignant) and Blumhouse (the company behind Paranormal Activity, M3GAN, and Get Out.) The film doesn’t have any talent attached right now, but the two companies are currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. Blumhouse says, &quot;it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen&quot;.

                              <span>Amazon have quietly dipped their first toe into PC componentS, listing the Amazon Basics Computer Cooling Fan: a single-fan, RGB-lit air cooler. Judging from the manual it supports the very latest socket types for Intel and AMD’s gaming CPUs, and being under the Amazon Basics brand, it&#x27;s dirt cheap at £21 / £27.

Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing.

Episode 4 - Gas That Raptor
Episode 5 - The Spit Hits the Fan
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

The official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:
Matsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. 
Perhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.
In recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has released a new teaser trailer for its upcoming Pokémon reboot. 
The Pokémon Company revealed back in December that the long-running Pokémon anime starring Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu would be coming to an end soon, set to be replaced by a new Pokémon anime with two new protagonists. The Pokémon Company has released a new trailer that reveals these two new main characters are Loko, &quot;the girl with the awe-inspiring pendant,&quot; and Roy, &quot;the boy with the mysterious Poké Ball.&quot; Plus, we get another look at Friede, who is the Professor of this anime, alongside Captain Pikachu.

The trailer above also reveals that this new Pokémon anime will debut in Japan with an hour-long special on April 14. As for the rest of the world, the release remains unknown but the trailer does say 2023 and beyond so hopefully sometime this year. 
Here&#x27;s another look at the three characters introduced in today&#x27;s trailer: 

Strangely, this trailer wasn&#x27;t released during the Pokémon Day showcase, which aired earlier this week. There, The Pokémon Company announced a new stop-motion animation series coming to Netflix, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, a re-reveal of Pokémon Sleep, and more.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can jump into Metroid Fusion when the game is added to the NSO library on March 8. 
After surprise releasing Metroid Prime Remastered last month, Metroid fans have another game from the series&#x27; history to play through, this time in the Game Boy Advance game first released in 2002. Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran&#x27;s full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021&#x27;s Metroid Dread. 
Check out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: 


&quot;In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s description of the game reads. &quot;This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite&#x27;s only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it&#x27;s too late.&quot; 
Nintendo says Metroid Fusion contains &quot;a multitude of secrets&quot; for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. 
Speaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Metroid Prime Remastered review. Check out our list of every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Sega Genesis, and GBA game on Nintendo Switch Online after that. 
Metroid Fusion hits Nintendo Switch Online next week on March 8.

This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus occupies a unique place in the SSD ecosystem, offering high-end PCIe 4.0 performance while costing less than commonly-cited alternatives like the WD SN850x and Samsung 990 Pro. Today the 2TB size of the drive is down to £163, a 34% reduction that makes it particularly tempting to pick up.

Three people &quot;familiar with the matter&quot; have apparently said that the offer of licensing deals to rivals, such as Nintendo, Nvidia and Sony, have succeeded in addressing EU antitrust concerns.

                              <span>The Alienware AW3423DWF is a monitor we&#x27;ve talked about a few times, as this 34-in ultrawide QD-OLED manages to outperform almost everything else on the market - albeit with a four-figure price tag that also eclipses almost every alternative. 
Now though, this 3440x1440 165Hz gaming OLED has dropped in price by a sizeable 26% or £310. That brings the monitor well into three-figure territory at £880, still pricy but a reasonable value given that this Dell monitor is head and shoulders above its IPS, VA and TN opponents.

                              <span>Somehow, it&#x27;s been almost a decade since the last numbered Age Of Wonders game. Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it&#x27;s shaping up to be. I&#x27;ve spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. 


There&#x27;s a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it&#x27;s also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&amp;D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I&#x27;d even go as far as saying it could be one of this year&#x27;s biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.

                              <span>The next game from the studio behind The Surge, Atlas Fallen, was announced last year with a CG trailer that didn’t give much away. A few snippets of gameplay at the end of the trailer revealed speedy action against giant beasts and a semi-open world desert you can slide across - and who doesn’t love sliding in games? We now know when to expect developer Deck13’s latest, as the team have announced a May 16th date for PC and consoles. Publisher Focus Entertainment say a gameplay reveal trailer is “coming soon”, but for now we can enjoy a couple of new screenshots.

With EA asking if people would like remakes of Dead Spaces 2 and 3, and The Outer Worlds getting a remastered Spacer&#x27;s Choice Edition, we&#x27;re having a big old thinkeroo about remakes and remasters - including which games we&#x27;d most like to see remade.

All very exciting stuff for fans of the kickpunching adventure, although, if you’re my kind of nerd, you likely got a kick out of all the film references in the trailer.

                              <span>We&#x27;re three weeks away from the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake, and in preparation of its imminent launch Capcom chucked over a fresh batch of in-game footage for us to talk about. The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.


As Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon&#x27;s refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That&#x27;s one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn&#x27;t intentional! What a pleasing coincidence!

                              <span>A new Half-Life mod adds raytracing to Valve&#x27;s venerable first-person shooter, a shiny slap of 2023 lighting technology in a 1998 game. I normally think such anachronistic upgrades look awful but this one works for me. Rather than just slam fancy modern tech into an old game, the mod wants to change the whole look. And it succeeds in a surprising way: by making the rest of Half-Life look older.

The Earthquake Relief Bundle is available for £25/$30 (or any higher price) until March 8th and all proceeds will be going to charity.

                              <span>I was a big fan of classic TellTale, the studio that put out episodic adventure games on a conveyor belt. I&#x27;m not the new one in sheep’s clothing, because they haven’t released anything yet. Like many, I was especially drawn to The Wolf Among Us, a neo-noir murder mystery set in the same universe as the Fables graphic novels. It would have been quite poetic to return to the series ten years after its debut, but that’s not going to be paw-sibble, as new TellTale have announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed out of 2023. There’s no new release window, but maybe it&#x27;ll be ready in 2024. Hopefully.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that&#x27;s basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that&#x27;s true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it&#x27;s more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you&#x27;re more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that&#x27;ll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja&#x27;s most encouraging effort yet.

                              <span>At first glance, King Of The Castle might look similar to other medieval political sims; something like Reigns or Yes, Your Grace, where you ascend the throne, rule a kingdom, and make decisions that will impact your gold reserves, military strength, or alliances. That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you.

                              <span>The overlap of Powerwash Simulator fans and Final Fantasy VII diehards hits in full force today, thanks to the launch of a free DLC pack for the popular sim. You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.
The Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. 


This DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, 
“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, &#x27;let’s wash the entire Shinra building.&#x27; Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”
This pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. 
Powerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Panic has revealed that it will hold a Playdate Update showcase next week. 
More specifically, the showcase will air at 9 a.m. PT on March 7 and during it, Panic will reveal new Playdate games and more. The presentation will run for 13 minutes and will also include an update on Catalog, which is Panic&#x27;s &quot;own curated, on-device and web browser storefront for Playdate software.&quot; 
For the uninitiated, Playdate is a piece of handheld hardware that began shipping to customers in April of last year. It&#x27;s a small device with a black and white screen and a unique crank on the side of it. This crank is integrated into many of the games you can play with it.
Since last April, more than 25,000 Playdate units have shipped to customers. Playdate is not yet availabe on demand for would-be purchasers but you can preorder the device to receive one in the next wave. 
The Playdate Update showcase will air on the official Panic YouTube channel.

                              <span>Given that Dead Island 2 has been in development for the better part of a decade, it’s understandable to have some trepidation about its quality (and general existence). Developer Dambuster Studios hopes to convince players that Dead Island 2 is not only close to finished but is a worthy follow-up by releasing an extended gameplay walkthrough that provides the rawest look at its action. 
The guided demo follows Irish punk rocker Dani, one of the game&#x27;s six playable characters, and shows off a lot of the moment-to-moment action across various locales. The gory F.L.E.S.H. system is on full display, as is the wacky makeshift weaponry, including electrified Wolverine-esque claws. We also get a look at the card-based perk system and one strange sidequest involving pizza. 


Dead Island is slated to launch on April 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. We recently featured the game on our cover and you check out a month’s worth of exclusive features by visiting our coverage hub.</span>

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor director Stig Asmussen of Respawn Entertainment wants the series to be a trilogy. 
This news comes from a new IGN Unfiltered interview with the director, which is where Asmussen revealed that even before the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in 2019, the team was already discussing sequel ideas. For Asmussen, Cal&#x27;s story has always been a trilogy in his head. 
&quot;We were already talking about the second game,&quot; said Asmussen. &quot;I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we&#x27;re breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it&#x27;s like: &#x27;Well, where are we going with the second game?&#x27; I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.&quot; 
Asmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas &quot;that we could do beyond that as well.&quot; 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28. While waiting to get your hands on the game, watch Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, and then check out our exclusive preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor for new details about the story, exploration, and combat.

Team Ninja has earned a reputation for crafting some of the most satisfying action games around, nimbly transitioning from the high-octane action Ninja Gaiden series to the Soulslike thrills of Nioh. Its latest effort, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, is an unforgiving but deeply rewarding showcase of freneticism that lives up to this lineage. The smooth swordplay, brilliant boss fights, and novel systems further prove Team Ninja’s ability to craft unrelenting experiences.

                              <span>Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron&#x27;s thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald&#x27;s recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.

Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We&#x27;ve updated the article with the correction.</span>

                              <span>Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve done [crunch], and I don&#x27;t want to do it again, and it&#x27;s not fair to ask it,&quot; Ottilie tells IGN. &quot;You can&#x27;t plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don&#x27;t want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below.

                              <span>With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…</span>

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher&#x27;s battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was &quot;disbanded,&quot; according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as &quot;part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that&#x27;s been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.&quot; Be sure to check out Kotaku&#x27;s write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

                              <span>A new thing for RPS in 2023 is the RPS Game Club, a kind of monthly book club for games where we pick a game to play each month, write some cool things about it, and have a big all liveblog discussion with you lot, our readers, at the end of it. It&#x27;s a project I&#x27;ve been wanting to get off the ground for some time now, and finally, the Treehouse Game Club doors have been busted open... and there&#x27;s some toe-tapping guitar music coming from inside? That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;re playing Hi-Fi Rush as our first RPS Game Club game, and we hope you&#x27;ll join us on this month-long musical journey.

Such is the case with the Ryzen 7 7700X, the middle child of the Zen 4 lineup and an absolutely beastly performer when it comes to gaming thanks to its full-fat eight-core, one-CCD design. This chip launched at $399 but is now $100 cheaper thanks to a discount code at Newegg, where you can pick up the 7700X for $298.99 when you use code BTSCP2655 at the checkout.

                              <span>“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

Today, the team held a fifth-anniversary livestream for their hit co-op shooter, and they also announced the first three games they’ll be releasing as a publisher, including a Deep Rock Galactic spin-off, a top-down shooter, and a spell-slinging roguelike - all coming from indie teams based in Denmark.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a sometimes hard to define line between a game that effectively establishes and embellishes its fiction (good, righteous), and one that has &quot;lore&quot; (tedious, lowly). It&#x27;s a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I&#x27;m going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It&#x27;s also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

The open-world RPG has always been playable on the portable machine, but it’s now Steam Deck verified - meaning Valve have tested it and used their almighty wisdom to determine it’ll run without a hitch.

This news comes from a report by Kotaku which says the layoffs happened over a last-minute Zoom call, according to three of their sources. EA later confirmed the news, calling the layoffs part of their “ongoing global strategy” to expand the “distribution of our Apex Legends testing team.”

                              <span>One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it&#x27;s even for the right reasons. Perhaps I&#x27;d spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I&#x27;d witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island&#x27;s flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I&#x27;d just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn&#x27;t looking.
Sons Of The Forest&#x27;s great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player&#x27;s trust until they&#x27;re ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

                              <span>If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.</span>

While he holds his own, he must tap into the powers of Ifrit to finally take her down, and you can watch all that play out in this new NGT. Enjoy!


As you can see, the Eikon fights are shaping up to be massive, climatic, and flashy combat scenarios that we can&#x27;t wait to see more of in the final game. For more, you can read Wesley&#x27;s full Final Fantasy XVI preview thoughts here.

                              <span>After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

As you can see, Final Fantasy XVI is looking to be the most action-heavy mainline game in the series. But traditional Final Fantasy mainstays like magic, potions, and, of course, Cid are still part of the formula. For more, you can read Wesley&#x27;s full Final Fantasy XVI preview thoughts here.

                              <span>This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!
