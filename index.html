                              <span>The Dragon Age is coming to Netflix
Today, Netflix and BioWare announced a new collaboration to bring Dragon Age to the streaming platform. Dragon Age: Absolution is a new series set in the world of Thedas, arriving this December on Netflix.
Shown off during today&#x27;s Netflix Geeked stream, Dragon Age: Absolution is a six-episode series. It&#x27;ll follow a set of new characters from the world of Dragon Age. That includes elves, Qunari, mages, knights, and some other surprises.

Dragon Age: Absolution is set in Tevinter, which has some interesting implications. Plus, with the next Dragon Age game also heading Tevinter, the Netflix series could potentially set up storylines. Or it might just be a good entry point for newcomers. Either way, Tevinter is definitely an interesting place to go; it&#x27;s a region full of magic, mystery, and intrigue.
The Dread Wolf nears
As for the Dragon Age series in the gaming realm, BioWare recently announced the title for its next entry. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be the next mainline game, with the player heading to Tevinter and dealing with a lingering threat in Solas.
The latest Dragon Age has been in development for a while, and BioWare has confirmed it won&#x27;t launch in 2022. Basically, ti&#x27;s going to be a while before we get a new virtual adventure in Thedas. In the meantime, this streaming series will be something for fans to dig into and pick apart, at the least.
Dragon Age: Absolution is another step of Netflix diving deeper into the world of video game adaptations, too. A new Cyberpunk anime was already announced, and its live-action Resident Evil adaptation arrives soon. Today&#x27;s stream also had news about Netflix&#x27;s Tekken series, The Cuphead Show, and the next book of Dota: Dragon&#x27;s Blood. And now, the streaming service will break into the fantasy world of Thedas.

Studio MDHR has been busy. Like, busy for the last five years or so, busy. Cuphead came out in September of 2017! From the original PC and Xbox One platforms it expanded to Switch in 2019, and PS4 in 2020. But it definitely feels like it came out recently, namely due to the airtight gameplay and evergreen aesthetic. If what we&#x27;ve seen of the Delicious Last Course DLC is representative of what&#x27;s to come, odds are it&#x27;ll be relevant for even longer. Here&#x27;s our Cuphead DLC preview.
We had the chance to sit down and watch a hands-off presentation of the Cuphead DLC, hosted by Chad, Jared, and Maja Moldenhauer; as well as Studio MDHR producer Eli Cymet. Kicking things off Cymet framed the presentation by noting that this was a &quot;…</span>

                              <span>Part 2 is live
The Fallout 76 Dread Island storyline has been extended, as part 2 of the new radio play drama is out: you can listen to it now!
The meta narrative follows the brother and sister team of Anna and Emilio, alongside of their very Lost in Space-esque robot companion H-4RT, as they explore and survive Dread Island.  Bethesda is saying that the &quot;final two chapters&quot; will arrive next week. In a really cool turn, you can listen to these radio plays in-game via your Pip-Boy (on the Pirate Radio station).
In other Fallout 76 news, Season 9 and the Test Your Metal update is set to arrive on June 14, which will inject a ton of new content into the game beyond the typical season pass refresh. The team reminds folks that extra public events will be available (Ruse Eagle Arena, Moonshine Jamboree, and Eviction notice), as well as quality of life upgrades like spotting downed enemies with a more obvious yellow highlight.
This weekend is also hosting a &quot;Gold Rush&quot; event: &quot;Throughout this weekend, you can visit the Gold Press Machines at The Crater and Foundation to exchange your Treasury Notes for up to double the usual daily amount of Gold Bullion.&quot;

During yesterday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest stream, Street Fighter fans received confirmation that America&#x27;s Hero, Flaptop Fanatic, and all-round Family Man Col. Guile would be returning to the ring for the series&#x27; latest installment, Street Fighter 6. The trailer gave us one of our first real in-depth looks at the sequel&#x27;s combat, while demonstrating the power of the RE engine in its ability to afford the military hero his first-ever set of eyebrows.
Indeed, for the first time in the mainline timeline since his franchise debut, Guile is rocking a sweet pair of eye caterpillars, proving that it was well worth me buying that PS5 console after all. In addition, he has also grown out a sweet goatee, which seems to be Capcom&#x27;s go-to method of saying &quot;This Character is Older&quot;. Much like hi…</span>

                              <span>Super Star, Dream Land 3, and Dream Course
Nintendo just added three new Kirby SP games to the Switch Online service: building upon the existing original versions that already existed on Switch. As a reminder, &quot;SP&quot; versions are modified editions of Switch Online NES or SNES games that essentially have a &quot;cheat/unlock&quot; save out of the box. That&#x27;s really it.
Breaking this down, here&#x27;s what the Switch Online Kirby SP games do:
Kirby Super Star SP: You get Revenge of Meta Knight mode access immediately
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 3 SP: An easier difficulty/extras are available
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course SP: Extras unlocked, including more multiplayer stages (this is probably the most useful of the three)
SP versions started off as a cute little flight of fancy bonus, but at this point people are asking for an option to hide them entirely from the interface: which has become more unwieldy and bloated as more games have been added. Initially &quot;SP&quot; seemed like something special, like maybe an official ROM hack or a different edition of a classic game: but they turned out to just be, by and large, save-doctored retreads.
Another issue is that Nintendo potentially sees these as &quot;updates,&quot; which slows down future games from becoming part of the service sooner. It&#x27;s tough to tell what the actual cadence of games is for the Switch Online service by any metric, as &quot;slow&quot; generally sums it up: from the launch of the NES service all the way to the current era of Nintendo 64 and Genesis.

                              <span>A new report says Ragnarok will still arrive this year
One of Sony&#x27;s heavy-hitters this year may still be on target. A new report indicates God of War Ragnarok is on track for a November launch, with a release date reveal expected later this month.
Bloomberg reports via three sources familiar with the project that God of War Ragnarok is planned for November. This comes after an earlier report that the new God of War had slipped to 2023.
Jason Schreier of Bloomberg cast doubt on the 2023 news yesterday. His new report seems to affirm that Ragnarok will arrive this year. No dates are set in stone with development, but the report indicates that as of this week, it&#x27;s still on track for November. Bloomberg&#x27;s report does note that Ragnarok has slipped internally. Earlier this year, it was reportedly set to arrive in September, but was recently bumped to November.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EE-4GvjKcfs
This is some reassuring news for fans who might have been concerned after God of War Ragnarok was absent from both the Sony State of Play and yesterday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest. The follow-up to 2018&#x27;s God of War has been a hotly anticipated game since it was first teased.
Fimbulwinter in November
While some ratings board movement indicated Ragnarok may still be set for this year, today&#x27;s report adds some more certainty. As of this writing, Sony has not officially announced a date for God of War Ragnarok, outside a 2022 window.
It&#x27;s been a leaky couple of days for Sony, as The Last of Us Remake news slipped out ahead of schedule yesterday. The rekindling of the original Last of Us was set to be the closer for Summer Game Fest.
The June State of Play held last week focused mainly on third-party titles, so it&#x27;s no surprise people are curious about what Sony&#x27;s first-party lineup looks like right now. Hopefully as the summer of games news rolls on, we&#x27;ll get a firmer idea of what&#x27;s in store for PlayStation.

                              <span>It&#x27;s 600 platinum
Typically, Nintendo has been updating the My Nintendo physical reward storefront (paid for by way of platinum points currency) with every first-party release. Switch Sports got a towel, and now Mario Strikers: Battle League has a drawstring bag.
The bag is 600 platinum points, clocks in at 15&quot;x18&quot;, and is double-sided (the front showcases the main logo, while the back has more roster members suited up in various poses). You can find the listing for it here.
Nintendo also has another little bonus: Mario Strikers party favors. By redeeming 30 platinum here, you can print seven pages of stuff yourself, including &quot;eight invitations, four cupcake holders, six pennant flags, and six party toppers.&quot;
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

So remember when Geoff Keighly said that he thinks publishers have learned that they should probably have &quot;30 minutes plus&quot; conferences, or less micro-conferences in general? Well Square Enix has a 10 minute Final Fantasy VII stream planned for June 16 at 6PM ET.
For reference, here&#x27;s the quote:
“There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that…I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.”

Welp!
The stream kicks off below at 6PM ET on June 16, with the following caveat from Tetsuya Nomura: &quot;At only around 10 minutes long, it will be short and sweet, but we have packed in lots of information, so I hope everyone can look forward to the unveiling.&quot; Add it to the pile! Less obvious candidates include a tease for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 or some new media project; more obvious candidates are mobile developments for VII-related projects.
If Square Enix doesn&#x27;t show anything related to Part 2  in this Final Fantasy VII stream, they&#x27;re just setting themselves up for disappointment. Can you imagine the reaction if it was just a stream for First Soldier and Ever Crisis?

                              <span>Who&#x27;s Bad?
The mysterious legacy of the Sonic 3 soundtrack has reared its head once again, as Sega has revealed that upcoming retro compilation Sonic Origins will not feature the original score from the 1994 release. Instead, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles will feature an &quot;adapted&quot; soundtrack, faithfully recreated by composer Jun Senoue.
Sonic fans had been awaiting news on the Sonic Origins soundtrack situation, well aware that Sonic 3 score is mired in misty red tape due to the alleged input of one Michael Jackson, who supposedly composed some of the game&#x27;s tracks despite not actually being credited in-game. Since its release, both members of Michael Jackson&#x27;s team and Sega executives have delivered mixed messages as to whether &quot;The King of Pop&quot; did indeed work on the best-selling Sega Mega Drive title, with no real confirmation either way.
https://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1535011473218494487?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;PZcbCmTmIdkgAhJn58Zwnw
In a special Sonic Origins live stream held yesterday, social media manager Katie Chrzanowski clarified that the Sonic Origins edition of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles will feature a recomposed version of the original score, with Senoue even utilizing original Sega Mega Drive technology and his original collection of Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to truly capture that classic 16-bit feel.
While the fact that Sonic 3 is not being 100% replicated in its entirety will be a disappointment to the fanbase, Senoue is one of the best in the biz, with no doubt that the tweaked score will be equally as compelling as the one that Jackson did... I mean did not... write.
Sonic Origins launches June 23 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Welcome to Shit City (literally that&#x27;s the name of the city)
After a busy day of Summer Game Festing, I&#x27;m pretty much spent, but leave it to Devolver Digital (and Suda) to supercharge my brain for a bit with another chaotic showcase. On one extreme, we saw the adorable 2D-meets-3D storybook adventure The Plucky Squire — and on the other, there was Anger Foot, a face-kicking action game for sickos.
The first gameplay glimpse from developer Free Lives (Broforce, GORN, Terra Nil) looks unhinged. I&#x27;m talking &quot;Academy Award winner Russell Crowe in Unhinged&quot; unhinged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;7R1XJv-pylk
It&#x27;s one of the most no-bullshit, take-it-or-leave-it showings I&#x27;ve seen in a while, and I also appreciate the synopsis, which reinforces this game&#x27;s unrelenting mood.
&quot;Unleash the world&#x27;s deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies,&quot; as Devolver Digital and Free Lives put it. &quot;Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.&quot;
I can already tell Anger Foot will be the kind of game where there&#x27;s an ideal &quot;wow, that went smooth!&quot; way to play, and getting the flow down just right will surely take practice. In the meantime, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be funny to fumble your way through these setups, too. If you&#x27;ve ever wondered how Hotline Miami would (or could) translate its frantic room-clearing carnage to 3D, well, this is probably the closest we&#x27;re getting for now.
General mood aside, you don&#x27;t need to take the reveal trailer&#x27;s word for it — there&#x27;s a demo right now on Steam. Anger Foot is planning a 2023 release.

                              <span>This is a whole vibe
Sometimes, you just have to skate. And sometimes, you make a deal with the devil and you really, really do just have to skate. Skate Story is a game about the latter, coming sometime in 2023.
Shown off during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital summer showcase, Skate Story is about a deal with the devil. You, as a demon made of glass and pain, have to skate to the moon and swallow it to earn your freedom. Simple enough, right?
Seeing it in motion, though, is something else. It&#x27;s reminding me of Thumper, but with chiller music and sick kickflips. I&#x27;ve probably watched the trailer below at least a half-dozen times already.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;x6j0zKSXAFE
The camera angle is absolutely wonderful too. Its shown in a way that reminds me of old skate videos. As you course through the underworld, you&#x27;ll also get new decks, wheels, and trucks, as well as a host of tricks to really add some style to your cruising.
Skating through it all
Skateboarding games are always interesting to me, but even over the last couple years, skating has been reimagined in some fascinating ways. The Ramp put a minimalist spin on just the raw action. And OlliOlli World takes a level-based approach with a story and goals that really added a lot to the experience.
That&#x27;s what excites me about Skate Story in this trailer. It&#x27;s a whole different vibe, and one I&#x27;m really gelling with the more I see it. Developer Sam Eng has posted some great technical looks at the tricks in play, and they are just a joy to watch.
https://twitter.com/skatestorygame/status/1486147388255395840
Suffice to say, I&#x27;m looking forward to nailing some sick tricks in the surreal dream world of Skate Story when it arrives in 2023. It&#x27;s up on Steam now, if you&#x27;d like to add it to your wishlist.

                              <span>A cult in lamb&#x27;s clothing
This summer, it&#x27;s finally time to start the cutest lil&#x27; cult you ever did see. Cult of the Lamb will launch on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.
The news was part of today&#x27;s Devolver Digital summer showcase. In between skits about Mecha-Suda51 and the convergence of all video games, Massive Monster&#x27;s adorable roguelike-meets-management game finally locked in a release date. We also got a new animated trailer here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;CI6D2iYCTcU
A demo for Cult of the Lamb is live on Steam today too, ahead of its August launch date. That way you can try out taking over the woods before you buy all the way in.
Building up a new following
Cult of the Lamb follows a little lamb, who narrowly avoids being destroyed only to become beholden to a dark spirit. Paying back your debt means assisting this spirit in taking over the woodlands and destroying the other prophets.
Along the way, you can recruit a following of other happy creatures to do your bidding. That means harvesting crops, building new structures, and gradually constructing a quaint home base you can visit between escapades.

It&#x27;s a cool town-building twist on the usual action-roguelike formula. I got to demo a build at PAX East earlier this year, and was really own over both by its style and its compelling management.
As the summer showcases start to ramp up, it&#x27;s nice to see a cool project get locked in for a release date, and so soon at that. Looks like I&#x27;ll be building up my own following in just a few months.
Cult of the Lamb arrives on August 11 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Endless color and creativity
I&#x27;m always on the lookout for creative new titles that are doing things in games that we haven&#x27;t seen quite yet, and The Plucky Squire looks to be exactly that. We got a glimpse at the game during today&#x27;s Devolver Digital Showcase, and the trailer showcased adorable 2D gameplay that took place in a storybook, before shifting to 3D gameplay, and back to 2D again. The gameplay itself looks like a combination of side-scrolling and hack-and-slash gameplay, with some puzzles and fighting game sections?

I honestly love the fact that I can&#x27;t pin down exactly what this experience will be like, because that likely means it will keep us on our toes the whole way through. It&#x27;s colorful, it&#x27;s playful, and looks like a breath of fresh air in this year&#x27;s sea of dark, violent sci-fi shooters. The Plucky Squire is in development by All Possible Futures, and of course will be published by Devolver Digital. No release date yet, but the game is available to wishlist on Steam right now, and it will be coming out on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2023.

In the wake of the Summer Game Fest 2022 Opening Showcase, Geoff Keighley has announced that the event will return in 2023 in both digital and physical formats.
Now you&#x27;re probably thinking &quot;okay - so?&quot;. Well, just to remind you, dear readers, ESA - the parent company of E3 - has recently reiterated its intention for E3 to return as a physical event in 2023. Effectively, this means that E3 and Summer Game Fest will be hosting competing physical events, likely at the same time.

During an interview with IGN for the upcoming Sonic Frontiers, Sega&#x27;s Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka has expressed his ongoing interest in creating a new Sonic Adventure game. It&#x27;s been over 20 years since Sonic Adventure 2 originally released on the Sega Dreamcast.
Not only that, but Iizuka stated that he hopes to use the lessons learned with Sonic Frontiers and apply them to a hypothetical future Sonic Adventure. Here&#x27;s what he had to say:

Last year, a open world RPG zoo simulator called Super Zoo Story went a little bit viral for being accused of copying Stardew Valley a little too much in their art style. After Stardew creator ConcernedApe took to his Discord to address the issue, the developers posted an apology to their Twitter, saying that they would &quot;redesign any and all assets&quot; that were too close for comfort.
And it seems like they&#x27;ve been doing that, as a year later, they&#x27;ve returned with a new trailer, showing off some of those redesigns, as you can see in the trailer above and the tweet below.

We here at Nintendo Life are always hungry because, while not many are aware, writing about Nintendo everyday works up a massive appetite. So it’s only natural that when the new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer revealed another food-themed Pokémon, we couldn’t help but wonder how it would taste.

All The New Pokémon In Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet

Scarlet and Violet aren’t the only games with edible Pokémon in them, however. Of the approximately 37 billion Pokémon now discovered, we uncovered 11 food-themed Pokémon and their evolutionary lines – excluding fish, most plants, and Pokémon that otherwise have no food motif (hey, we love us some jamón but we&#x27;re not throwing Lechonk in here just yet) – and ranked them by how much we’d want to eat them. No, we haven’t had lunch yet. Why do you ask?

Ground Divers is a Dig Dug-style mining game, featuring the voice behind Dragon Ball Z&#x27;s Cha-La-Head-Cha-La opening song, Hironobu Kageyama. It&#x27;ll be coming to the Nintendo Switch on June 30th.

This week, we finally saw the Summer Game Fest kick off with a packed - albeit slightly overlong - opening showcase. The show was full of surprises, though we do think it&#x27;s a shame that some of the announcements were leaked beforehand (poor Naughty Dog).
In terms of the Switch, there wasn&#x27;t a great deal to get excited about, with most games earmarked for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. That doesn&#x27;t mean there was nothing, though - the highlights include a fresh look at TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, the official announcement of Flashback 2, and a new look at Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course DLC.

Four years ago, The Elder Scrolls VI was announced, with little more than a title and a bit of concept art. It&#x27;s not a huge surprise that there&#x27;s an Elder Scrolls sequel in the works at Bethesda — Skyrim is one of the most ubiquitous games out there, and it&#x27;s even rumoured to be coming to Switch for a second time — but we have heard very little about it since its reveal in 2018.
Apparently, Bethesda&#x27;s space game Starfield is the in-house priority, so executive producer Todd Howard has warned fans that they should be &quot;very patient&quot;, especially since Starfield is looking to nab a 2023 release. But just days ahead of the Xbox/Bethesda showcase, Todd Howard said that Starfield is getting the &quot;finishing touches&quot;, so it&#x27;s not wholly unlikely that we&#x27;ll get a glimpse of ESVI.

Japanese developer Jupiter hits a milestone celebration on 11th June — it turns 30! And to share the love, and promote its motto — &quot;Let’s Play! Let’s Smile!&quot; — the studio has announced that it will be slashing the price of its games on the Switch and 3DS eShop by 30% from tomorrow!
We couldn&#x27;t think of a better number to celebrate the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Throughout its long history, the developer has worked on tons of games, including Pokémon Pinball, multiple Pokémon Mini games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, The World End with You, and many, many excellent Picross games that we&#x27;ve lost dozens of hours to.

Metal Max Xeno: Reborn has finally reached us in the West. The RPG series has never been a huge hit outside of Japan, and this latest entry changed up the formula by making it a more open-world adventure.
Developer Kadokawa Games has been working on a direct sequel called Metal Max: Wild West, first announced in 2019 (as Metal Max Xeno Reborn 2). The game was due to release on Nintendo Switch in Japan this year. However, the developer has been quiet on the game since May 2021.

Editor&#x27;s note: This review, originally published on Saturday 14th May 2022, was based on the imported Japanese version of the game. However, you can find updated comments relating specifically to the English language release at the bottom of the page.

Metal Max fans in the West are not what you’d call spoiled for choice, especially in regards to English-language releases. It would be more accurate to say that series fans are “Metal Max-starved.” In the span of the series’ 31-year existence, only two games have been released in English —2006’s Metal Saga (thusly named due to trademark issues at the time) and 2018’s Metal Max Xeno. For English-speaking fans, it’s Metal Max Xeno that’s relevant here, as Metal Max Xeno: Reborn is, as the title suggests, a reimagining of that game.

Trust Devolver Digital to give us a very unique showcase. The publisher hosted its annual Digital Showcase yesterday, which gave us a few fun announcements — including James Turner&#x27;s adorable-looking new game.
But what people remember from Devolver Digital is its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek presentations which do everything from having a jab at the games industry to creating amusing anecdotes. This year&#x27;s presentation was called &#x27;Devolver Digital Marketing Countdown to Marketing&#x27; and was hosted by mecha Suda51 (of No More Heroes fame). And yeah, it&#x27;s not the real one. At least, that&#x27;s what Devolver said!

Approximately 60 million Pokémon games were shipped in the last financial year, according to the latest data found via the official Pokémon Company website.
As discovered by Serebii (thanks, VGC), The Pokémon Company has now sold over 440 million units of Pokémon related software. Previously, the website gave figures up to end of March 2021, quoting over 380 million units sold. The implication here, of course, is that at least 60 million units were sold over the course of FY2022.

The good news is that if you can&#x27;t attend in person, the exhibition will be viewable online too. Here&#x27;s a bit more info on what to expect from the official website:

Mario is once again showing off his sporting prowess, this time on the soccer pitch (or football pitch if you want to be British about it) in Mario Strikers: Battle League for Switch.
The game — which we named &quot;the best sports game on Switch&quot; in our enthusiastic 9/10 review — offers a surprisingly strategic and undeniably violent take on the beautiful game (as the &#x27;Battle&#x27; in the title implies), with ample opportunity to employ different tactics and go as deep as you like whether playing alone or with friends online or locally.

Here&#x27;s something we probably all saw coming and were simply waiting to be confirmed — Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will not have all of its original soundtrack intact in Sonic Origins.
Sonic 3&#x27;s music legacy has been long scrutinized and debated. A few years ago, it was confirmed that the King of Pop Michael Jackson did indeed contribute to the music, and just last month, Jackson&#x27;s keyboardist Brad Buxer discussed the connection between MJ&#x27;s hit &#x27;Stranger in Moscow&#x27; and Sonic 3&#x27;s music.

Mario Strikers: Battle League kicks off on the Nintendo Switch today and unsurprisingly players are already on the hunt for any evidence of future characters. A new video on the GameXplain YouTube channel suggests Shy Guy could be a future character in some way or form, based on a finding within the game&#x27;s credits.
You see, the entire voice cast is seemingly revealed here, and tacked on at the very end is Nintendo Treehouse&#x27;s senior director of localisation, Nate Bihldorff - also known as the voice of Shy Guy. Every other voice on the list - from Charles Martinet (the voice of Mario and more) to Kazumi Totaka (Yoshi) - all appear to have a playable character assigned to their name except for Nate.

                              <span>We knew a Tekken anime was on the horizon after a teaser trailer hit in March, but we finally got some more details and new looks at Bandai Namco&#x27;s beloved fighting franchise&#x27;s animated form. And who best to do it? None other than its legendary producer Katsuhiro Harada.
The show will focus on the relationship Jin Kazama had with his mother, Jun, on Yakashima. Harada says their conversations are are his favorite scenes and a big focus of the animated series. Harada then says if Jin Kazama was a real person he would tell him: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for putting you through so many awful things.&quot;
Looks like we&#x27;ll see more of those awful things when Tekken: Bloodline debuts in 2022. Watch the full sneak peek above to see what&#x27;s in store.</span>

                              <span>Developer Snowman has captivated players with handcrafted indie gems, such as The Alto Series, Where Cards Fall, and Skate City. Today, on Netflix&#x27;s Geeked Week stream, it revealed a new game called Lucky Luna for iOS and Android, which will appear later this summer on Netflix&#x27;s streaming service. The game is free for all Netflix subscribers. 
Lucky Luna features entirely pixel art and is a vertically scrolling, platformer dungeon crawler. The big catch? You have no jump button to get around. Players swipe left and right to guide Luna through trap-filled dungeons with hidden secrets and alternate paths.
Every level presents a different environment and new mechanics that allow players to explore in a new way. In the story mode, your main goal is to collect as many pearls as possible to advance to the next stage.  You&#x27;ll also find new clues and light story elements to learn more about Luna&#x27;s past and discover her purpose.
Lucky Luna will also support an endless mode with procedurally generated runs for every environment. This is where you can make a name for yourself on the leaderboards. Your score is based on your speed, collected peals, and the number of floors you&#x27;ve descended. Gather enough treasure from your runs and you unlock additional endless dungeons to keep the run going. 
Lucky Luna debuts later this summer.</span>

                              <span>Dragon Age fans have something to tide them over as they wait for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Today, at Netflix Geeked Week, we got our first look at a new animated series from BioWare based on its beloved property called Dragon Age Absolution.
The showcased a cool animated style and new characters in the universe. However, it was not confirmed if this will tie into the upcoming game. The trailer stated: &quot;New heroes will rise&quot; and &quot;a new saga begins,&quot; making it seem like it offers a fresh entry point to the franchise. It&#x27;s also been a long time since we had some new Dragon Age lore. At the forefront of the trailer was a mysterious new character, as well as big powers and big baddies. 
Dragon Age Absolution hits in December.

                              <span>A new cinematic trailer for The Walking Dead: Last Mile has been released and it shows more about this interactive game event that will be live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when it begins next month. 
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s IGN Expo livestream and it features quite a unique spin on The Walking Dead franchise that we haven&#x27;t seen before. It looks like a game – its art style is reminiscent of Telltale&#x27;s series but a little less comic book-ey – but it doesn&#x27;t appear to actually be a game. Instead, it&#x27;s a multiplayer interactive event that will somehow task players (viewers?) with determining the events that happen, such as the outcome of the characters shown in the trailer. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here&#x27;s more about it from Skybound Games: 
&quot;From Skybound Games comes The Walking Dead: Last Mile which is part game, part interactive live experience as it relies on the audience to determine its outcome. It&#x27;s a massively interactive live event that is a Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch exclusive series.&quot; 
Last Mile begins exclusively on Facebook Gaming and Facebook Watch on July 11.</span>

                              <span>Amidst rumors galore regarding God of War: Ragnarok’s release date and whether it’s coming out this year or getting delayed to 2023, a new report says it’s targeting a release in November. 
This news comes from Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the development of Ragnarok say PlayStation plans to release it in November. Furthermore, the publication reports that two of those three people expect PlayStation to announce an exact release date later this month. 


Ragnarok was originally due out in 2021, according to its 2020 reveal, but Sony delayed it to 2022 in June of last year. Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge, who also performs motion capture for the character, revealed later that year that a surgery he had to get may have been responsible for the delay.

                              <span>Studio Iggymob and publisher Prime Matter have released a new trailer for Gungrave G.O.R.E. and it features plenty of gore, as the name would imply. It also reveals that the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime this fall. 
That’s exciting news for fans of games with lots of bullets, blood, and more because it’s right around the corner. Gungrave G.O.R.E. was first announced back in 2021 with a flashy (and again, very gory) gameplay trailer. If you’re excited, be sure to watch today’s new trailer: 


Gungrave G.O.R.E. is about the anti-hero Grave doing what he does best: mowing down undead targets using his twin pistols and weaponized coffin. Back in 2021, Prime Matter revealed that former Platinum Games and Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura was lending her artistic talents to the game as a character designer. You can tell, too, because these characters look great!
Gungrave G.O.R.E. is slated for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC and it will be released sometime this fall.

This news comes after months of controversy at Activision Blizzard surrounding its handling of Raven layoffs and the subsequent union efforts within the Call of Duty support studio. Here’s what Kotick wrote in the press release, in full: 
In December of last year, Activision Blizzard laid off several members of Raven’s quality assurance team. Shoftly after, dozens of Raven employees went on strike. Activision Blizzard did eventually break its silence on this strike, but it did not formally recognize it. Following that, 34 QA testers agreed to form a union. These testers asked Activision Blizzard to voluntarily recognize t…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has announced a broadcast happening next week for Final Fantasy VII’s 25th-anniversary celebration. 
More specifically, the “celebration broadcast” will air on June 16 at 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET on the official Square Enix YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, the answer is simple: Final Fantasy VII. This could be a stream specifically about the original release, which hit store shelves 25 years ago. But, as any Final Fantasy fan knows (and if you’re like me, hopes), we might hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake, or rather, its sequel. 
Join us next week for around 10 minutes to celebrate 25 years of @FinalFantasy VII: https://t.co/y074ldZMhg

June 10, 2022
Here’s what Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura says about the stream: 
Perhaps I’m reading too much into this but let’s put some pieces together: Nomura directed Final Fantasy VII Remake. This is a stream celebrating Final Fantasy VII. Players want to hear about the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Nomura specifically says “unveiling.” What could Nomura unveil? I’m betting the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Of course, the company could just reveal some new Final Fantasy VII merch or even more about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a mobile take on the beloved game, so it’s best to keep your expectations in check. Only time will tell for now, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review, and then check out this story about Nomura promising “even more new FFVII projects” in the future.

                              <span>Today during Devolver Digital&#x27;s Summer Game Fest live stream, a new trailer for Skate Story was revealed. And honestly, you just need to see it. It looks so cool. Check it out: 


For the uninitiated, Skate Story has been floating around for a while. Since 2020, developer Sam Eng has been slowly revealing the game on their own personal Twitter and the official Skate Story account. For the most part, these have been small gameplay videos. But today&#x27;s trailer finally gives us a peek at the game&#x27;s story – or at least its general premise. That being, per the trailer, &quot;You are a demon made of glass and pain and yet you must skate.&quot; What more could you need? More than that, we got extended looks at gameplay, including the unique art style. The camera angle and shake also look about as close to a real skate video as any video game&#x27;s gotten thus far.
I don&#x27;t mean to gush over a game I haven&#x27;t played yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on Skate Story. Luckily, it&#x27;s expected to come out on PC next year.</span>

                              <span>Cult of the Lamb will be released on August 11, publisher Devolver Digital announced today during its Summer Game Fest live stream. 
The news came by way of a new trailer, and while it didn&#x27;t show much, it finally let us know when we&#x27;ll be able to play the game. It also gives a great look at the tone, characters, and gameplay. Check it out in full below.


For more on Cult of the Lamb, make sure to check out our exclusive gameplay reveal from back in April.
In other Summer Game Fest news, Geoff Keighley hosted his own live stream today, giving new looks at The Callisto Protocol and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, as well as an official look at The Last of Us Part 1 – a remake of the 2013 game.</span>

And sure, we could just talk about how shitty that economy is, but a funnier and more effective way would be for someone to actually start sinking some serious cash into the game and see…

                              <span>Ever since Diablo Immortal launched amid a storm of controversy last week, people have been trying to work out how much it really costs to play this theoretically free game. I&#x27;ll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I&#x27;ve spent most of this week chasing answers, and I&#x27;ve come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.

                              <span>One time in the office (so, a hundred years ago) a hypothetical was posed: if you were given the chance to go to the moon, with a guarantee that nothing would go wrong, would you take it? &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;No way. Not a chance. I wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot; People were shocked at my refusal. &quot;But nothing will go wrong!&quot; they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.
Honestly, who can say that they&#x27;ve played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.

                              <span>No, not SHODAN or GLaDOS. I mean the other sort. The magic formulae of raw computer nonsense that runs under the cover of your favourite game and makes enemies flank you, or friendly NPCs toss a health kit just in time. Good AI is not an unbeatable genius. It is smartly stupid. It is both surprisingly clever and capable of wonderful carelessness. It can remind us of ourselves. Quick-witted on a good day, an absolute dunderhead on a bad one. Here&#x27;s a list of the 7 best AI in PC games.

                              <span>Staff who worked for Bethesda on post-apocalyptic multiplayer RPG Fallout 76 have come forward to share their stories from its development, and they don’t make for pleasant reading. Developers who spoke anonymously to Kotaku said they’d crunched in ten-hour shifts over six days a week prior to Fallout 76’s launch, with some saying they fantasised about being injured to avoid having to come into work the following day.

The last we saw of it was back in 2020. It resurfaced tonight during Devolver&#x27;s not-E3 showcase, and dang: it&#x27;s transformed into one of the most beautiful games I&#x27;ve ever seen.

                              <span>Anger Foot. It’s angry and there are certainly plenty of feet. From Free Lives, the creators of Broforce and Genital Jousting, it’s so aggressively kicky that I don’t feel like going near doors anytime soon. They describe it as a “lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking down doors and kicking ass”. Good grief. Keep an eye on the threatening tootsies in the trailer below.

Za výpočtem stojí  Emma Haruka Iwao z Google a k výpočtu byl použit Google Cloud se 128 virtuálními CPU a 864 GB RAM. Při výpočtu není až tak důležitá hrubá síla, jako spíše úložiště. K dispozici bylo 663 TB, z toho bylo použito 515 TB. Celkově bylo zapsáno 38,5 PB a přečteno 43,5 PB.</span>

                              <span>I rarely feel as conflicted about a game as I do about Honkai: Star Rail. It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG and I like those; but it&#x27;s a JRPG and I dislike those. It&#x27;s got a spacefaring train in it, which I always think is cute; but also it&#x27;s got anime waifus in it and those make me cringe. Its new trailer, which you&#x27;ll find below, is dynamic and exciting and well-edited; but... it&#x27;s got cringy anime waifus in it.

Watch it and make up your own mind.

                              <span>Nightingale, the upcoming PvE open-world survival craft &#x27;em up from former BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn&#x27;s new studio, is getting into the card game business, according to its latest gameplay trailer shown at tonight&#x27;s Summer Game Fest. Its freshly flaunted Realm Cards will be your ticket to navigating its mysterious portal network, although naturally you&#x27;ll need to craft them by pulping different resources together first. Anyone spot a paper press in the new trailer below?

This wasn&#x27;t part of anything, and was instead a random and unexpected announcement. Only kidding! It was one of many things shown at Summer Game Fest tonight.

Look past that comparison and I think there&#x27;s more to like about it on its own terms, however. Check out the new trailer below, which also delivers news of its release date and a playable demo.

                              <span>Day Of The Devs is probably my favourite part of the summer games jamboree every year because it does wonders for the visibility of indie games and their developers. Slotting in snugly right after Geoff regaled us with the Summer Game Fest stream, this year’s Day Of The Devs showcase marked the tenth anniversary. Tim Schafer and friends revealed more about some stonking looking indies from places as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan and Argentina. It was lovely to see some solo devs featured too, such as Madison Karrh with Birth, a point-and-click puzzler about loneliness, and Billy Basso’s beautiful pixel-art Metroidvania Animal Well.

Described as &quot;the ultimate body shop&quot;, Boss Factory is a free standalone demo you can access in The Epic Game Store (or by following a series of links through SaintsRow.com). In it you can have a ride on the character creator before the game comes out in August, and save your favourite and most bizarre looks. This was revealed with a trailer with all explosions and montages and that.

The good news is that our favoured platform will receive the same fancified version as is being developed for PlayStation 5; the bad news is that while the PlayStation 5 version has a September 2nd release date, there&#x27;s no confirmed date for the PC version yet.

And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m good with that. That&#x27;s great, really. Vermintide is fun but I&#x27;ve no affinity for Warhammer Fantasy so yes, give me bolters and Inquisitors and Ogryns and sci-fi Gothic cathedrals. See for yourself below.

                              <span>As the Summer Game Fest machine churns ever onward, we got an extended look at Witchfire. I&#x27;m afraid I am now of the opinion that &quot;dark fantasy first-person shooter&quot; is one of the most underwhelming word combinations in the English language. But hey, it&#x27;s a video, the game could be bananas good when it comes out, and I&#x27;m duty bound to tell you all about it in case you get really excited for it - and if you do, then good news, &#x27;cos the video confirms it&#x27;s coming to early access on the Epic Games Store soon (aiming for Q4 2022).

                              <span>First came Golf Club Wasteland, a post-apocalyptic sports game from Demagog Studios where the world&#x27;s remaining elite jetted around golf courses on the ruined surface of Earth. Then, earlier this year, they announced The Cub, a side-scrolling platformer telling a parallel story of one of the poor souls left behind on our home planet while the rest of humanity buggered off to Mars. Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It&#x27;s not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.

The Seventies aesthetic and Milton Keynes-esque, city-of-the-future feel shown in previous looks at the game are still very much in evidence – those massive swan statues are boss, and nobody hates monorails, right? Take a Logan’s Run at it yourself by watching the new trailer.

The announcement trailer doesn&#x27;t show anything in-game, but suggests it&#x27;ll still be about causing havoc as a goat, only now with co-op and Epic Games Store exclusivity.

Bloober say it&#x27;s the &quot;psychedelic experience fans know and love&quot; and has &quot;an expanded plotline&quot;, so this doesn&#x27;t sound like an entirely new game. The freshly revealed Layers Of Fears is being built in Unreal Engine 5. As such, the trailer makes for pleasantly unpleasant viewing.

Honestly, why does anyone bother building isolated space stations? It&#x27;s like getting married at Christmas in Albert Square at this point. Geoff was joined on stage by Roger Clark (who you will know from being Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption) and Troy Baker (who you will know from, I dunno, throw a dart, you&#x27;ll hit one) to briefly talk more about their characters and what the hap is heckening in this horror adventure game.

It&#x27;s also getting another major patch in the form of the &quot;Bolivar Patch&quot;, that&#x27;s focused on community features. But first, the DLC. This will explore the heritage of Latin America, letting players progress from the ancient era Caralans through to the Nazca, Taíno, Inca and contemporary Argentinians and Cubans. You needn&#x27;t wait to dig in, either, as the Latin America pack is out right now on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>Crikey, one thing I never expected to see at tonight’s Summer Game Fest was a sequel to Delphine Software and U.S. Gold’s cinematic sci-fi platformer Flashback, but there it was. Flashback 2 is coming from long-established French studio Microids, developers of the Syberia series. It’s been 30 years now since the original game released on PC, and Geoff Keighley was very excited to re-announce the sequel. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>Chance has always been an integral part of Firaxis’ turn-based tactics games. Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.
It’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos&#x27; fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.

Spider-Man and Scarlet Witch will be joining previously announced goodies such as Iron Man, Blade and Captain Marvel, while err... Scarlet Witch, Hulk and Venom will repping the game&#x27;s big bad demon mother Lilith. Man, if there&#x27;s one Avenger I wouldn&#x27;t want going all evil on me, it&#x27;s Hulk. And Scarlet Witch, to be fair. Why have these heroes joined the dark side in Firaxis&#x27; new tactics RPG? Well, we&#x27;ll be able to find out when the game launches on October 7th. Here&#x27;s a new trailer to celebrate.

Routine is back, baby, and at some point we will finally get to explore its sprawling moonbase. Have a peek at its terrible happenings in the new trailer below.

Taken from a very watery mission during the campaign, the trailer showed Task Force 141&#x27;s Captain Price, Gaz, Soap et al skulking through an oil rig before raiding a fleeing boat during a storm. I guess there was a reason why Activision Blizzard unveiled the game on a boat deck after all... Get a load of all its fancy new water tech below.

Like some other famous Street Fighters from back in the day, he’s only gone and grown some facial fluff too. Does it deflect blows or something? Judge for yourself after watching the trailer.

                              <span>The Summer Game Fest has brought the announcement of a new game based on Aliens, this time taking HR Giger&#x27;s glistening penetrators and James Cameron&#x27;s gung-ho space marines into real-time squad action. Due to launch next year, Aliens: Dark Descent will see marines battling xenomorphs as well as those Weyland-Yutani scamps. Sounds like it might be interesting, with persistent upgrades and deaths across a campaign. Check out the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>Seven years ago, I had high praise for Space Beast Terror Fright, a tense and often intense roguelikelike FPS about exploring alien-infested spaceships. It was murderously punishing, with limited ammo and endless aliens making it important to seal up routes and activate sentry turrets. It was great! Well, SBTF finally left early access and launched in full over the weekend, so I returned today and oh no. I have grown so very old since 2015, and this game is now too much for me. Oh no.

                              <span>Detailed-yet-relaxing village builder Ostriv isn&#x27;t far off one of my favourite games. Entirely unrelatedly, I had Tile Cities installed for about a month before finding time to play it.
Except, it&#x27;s not unrelated at all. It&#x27;s the game that Ostriv developer Yevheniy made while suffering through the invasion of Ukraine, &quot;to switch my mind from death and destruction towards peace and creativity&quot;. I&#x27;d be recommending it for sure even if I hadn&#x27;t found that out, because it&#x27;s a terrific little game that&#x27;s far more engaging than it looks.

                              <span>Despite Matthew almost wilfully misunderstanding the topic for this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast, we manage to settle down and talk about the games we&#x27;d most like to have toy sets of. What game d&#x27;you think would be the best Lego set? Action figures? Obscure 80s and 90s toy? Oh, we have fun on this show.
Diversions this week are predictably about toys we had as kid, including a very long sidebar about Mighty Max, and Matthew&#x27;s reverse-engineered Boglin hatred derived from his sad childhood. We also have some obligatory Platty Joobs round-up chat, and there&#x27;s an unintentionally difficult Cavern Of Lies this week, themed around Funko Pop, because any made up Funko Pop is indistinguishable from a real Funko Pop.

It’s a procedurally-generated romp through various mission types such as asteroid mining, battling space pirates and rescuing ships in distress, all spread throughout the galaxy. Introversion have quite a bit more to say on what they call their “broken, unfinished and bug filled prototype“ in their announcement video, which you can watch below.

I already enjoyed the demo, and now it&#x27;s bigger, fancier, and full of even more ridiculous combos. Today I had a run so overpowered I was afraid to even shoot, and fled explosions I hadn&#x27;t even intended to cause until I finally exploded myself. That&#x27;s the good stuff. And it&#x27;s only £2.

                              <span>Inside ActivisionBlizzard there are two wolves. Possibly dire wolves, or some other species of fantastical monster with surplus vowels in the name. Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it&#x27;s actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). 
Diablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it&#x27;s all right to play! However, I don&#x27;t know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it&#x27;s a bad decision and we&#x27;ve already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.

It&#x27;s being developed by Stunlock Studios, the folks behind arena-brawler Battlerite that lifts the fights from MOBAs like Dota 2 or League Of Legends and cuts away all the tedious build-up. So quite the departure then? Yes and no. V Rising strikes out as its own thing, but Stunlock&#x27;s back catalogue definitely bleeds into its combat and exploration and easygoing attitude. This is a game that&#x27;ll sink its teeth into you, which in turn, will make you want to sink your teeth into it

Another showcase is arriving this summer, though this one won&#x27;t be until next month. Annapurna Interactive announced today that it&#x27;s hosting a publisher showcase on July 28, 2022.
The news came at the end of the Day of the Devs showcase, following the Summer Game Fest Live stream. Annapurna Interactive says it will be bringing reveals, announcements, and more to its showcase.
Its stream will go live on July 28 at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET on Annapurna&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels.

Today marks the Summer Game Fest kick-off, and both the Live showcase and ensuing Day of the Devs have come to a close. In the latter, there were a bunch of really rad games, from both well-known developers and exciting newcomers.
While the Summer Game Fest Live showcase tends to focus on bigger games, the Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition showcase centered on smaller projects and teams. It&#x27;s a tradition that Double Fine has organized for a decade at this point, and it&#x27;s always nice to see what neat projects make their way into the showcase.
This year had some absolute winners, too. Bear and Breakfast continues to look like a chill, fun management sim and it&#x27;s arriving very soon. So is Escape Academy, a school life-meets-puzzle room adventure. …</span>

Well, it&#x27;s here! The initial &quot;big push&quot; Summer Game Fest stream just ended. Here&#x27;s a big old Summer Game Fest 2022 recap: emphasis on old.
Vibe check? I was heavily reminded of the low-key artifice of the PC Gaming Show throughout, where it was hard to tell what was actually a reveal and what had been shown weeks or months ago. There were lots of ads and a few &quot;exclusives/world firsts&quot; that were basically modified existing trailers. The Rock stopped by through a Zoom call to plug his energy drink (twice) and showed off a trailer for his new movie, Black Adam. The &quot;one more thing&quot; final announcement was a The Last of Us remake, which wouldn&#x27;t have hit that hard for a lot of people (myself included) even if it wasn&#x27;t leaked.
The lower energy aura has been the prevailing wi…</span>

After Blair Witch and The Medium, Bloober Team is returning to the world of Layers of Fear with a &quot;psychedelic&quot; horror game, Layers of Fears, that&#x27;s being developed in Unreal Engine 5 alongside Anshar Studios. A trailer debuted at Summer Game Fest 2022 with familiar characters and scenes from the wider series, albeit looking better than ever.
https://youtu.be/AwEXJ3T1EJM
It really feels like history is repeating itself, both in terms of the tortured artist storyline and the gameplay of Layers of Fear 1 and 2 (and Inheritance, the game with the painter&#x27;s daughter, which is easily forgotten about and will likely end up feeling the freshest here). We&#x27;ve seen tons of remasters and even full-on remakes in recent years, but this is blurring the lines in a way that I wasn&#x27;t expecting after Bloober Team&#x27;s recent teases.
&quot;Layers of Fears will be the complete, definitive, and at the same time unpredictable way to discover the stories of artists enslaved by their obsessions,&quot; according to Bloober Team. &quot;Prepare for an exquisite horror experience thanks to the expanded plot lines that will cast a new light on the overarching narrative.&quot; You can see some screenshots on Steam.

The developers say they&#x27;re &quot;focused on tense exploration and immersive storytelling,&quot; though that&#x27;s going to be a hard sell for some people based on the series so far.
I personally have had my fun with Layers of Fear (and to a lesser extent its direct sequel), so I&#x27;m curious if Layers of Fears will end up feeling fresh enough, conceptually, to justify itself. The visual fidelity is clearly a step up from the original games, but that can only take me so far. In general, this spooky (?) series has a lot of fans — and a lot of haters.
Layers of Fears is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store.

Warner Bros. Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming DC Comics title Gotham Knights. Currently in development for PC and new-gen consoles, the hard-hitting vigilante adventure will launch this fall, following a recent delay.
During Summer Game Fest, we go to see a new trailer focusing entirely on the acrobatic, highly-skilled martial artist, Nightwing. A former protege of The Batman himself, Dick Grayson would eventually break off from his role in The Dynamic Duo, striking out for himself as a peacekeeper in the mean streets of Gotham City. His incredible ninjitsu abilities and baton-based hand-to-hand skills fast-flatten any perp foolhardy enough to stand in his way.
Nightwing will be joined by Batgirl, Red Hood, and Robin in the new multiplayer title.
Gotham Knights launches October 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>With six extra cultures
Humankind kind of came and went for me, but today, we&#x27;re reminded that stuff is still actively coming out for it: like the Humankind Cultures of Latin America Pack that came out today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mDo_wyO1MBk
Here&#x27;s a full rundown of the Humankind Cultures of Latin America DLC content:
6 New Cultures
6 New Wonders
9 Independent Peoples
15 Narrative Events
30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy
I have to admit, the idea of more civilizations and things to do, along with quality of life features, has me interested in potentially jumping back in. Also, the Summer Game Fest trailer reveal had another tidbit of info: the game is coming to consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X) and &quot;will be playable from day one on Xbox Game Pass.&quot;
The Humankind - Heritage Edition on Console will include:
Digital Game
Cultures of Latin America Pack
Cultures of Africa Pack
Notre-Dame Pack
As long as it turns out OK, that&#x27;s probably where I&#x27;ll jump back in. On Game Pass, no less! With some DLC to boot! Sounds like how a lot of people are experiencing games in 2022, given how overwhelming any given moment can be when something is actually released.

                              <span>Be the boss of your dreams, or nightmares
The new Saints Row isn&#x27;t out until August, but you can perfect your look a little early. Deep Silver and Volition have launched a Saints Row character creator dubbed the &quot;Boss Factory,&quot; and it&#x27;s out now for free on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.
The Boss Factory will let you craft all kinds of looks for your avatar, the Boss, and I really mean all kinds. Today&#x27;s trailer showed everything from giant body-builder types to wild costumes, and even a Nosferatu-looking Boss. Finally, I can live out my crime-vampire dreams.

Big Boss energy
Saints Row has always been known for its more out-there vibes. But it&#x27;s also nice to see some options that really open up character creation, whether that&#x27;s making someone that feels more representative of you in the world, or just becoming the nocturnal ghoul you&#x27;ve always hoped to be. The creator advertises thousands of options, from teeth and make-up to muscles, tattoos, and skin tints. Heck, even the veins are customizable in the Saints Row Boss Factory. It&#x27;s a slider I never even thought to consider.
This character creator will let you get everything set, so your perfect Boss is ready by Aug. 23 when Saints Row launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. And in the meantime, you can live out your wildest Nightmare Factory dreams. Find the Saints Row Boss Factory at Epic here, the PlayStation Store here, and the Xbox store here.

Today we got a new look at gameplay for the upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide via a two-minute trailer which gave us a look at one of the missions we&#x27;ll get to experience in the game. Pre-orders for this bombastic FPS adventure are available now for PC and Xbox Series X/S, and players can get pre-order bonuses like weapon trinkets, outfits, and more. Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will be releasing on September 13, 2022.

Developer Fatshark&#x27;s CEO Martin Wahlund has this to share: “It’s been an exciting, and maybe a little crazy week for Fatshark, with two brand new Warhammer 40,000: Darktide trailers released. While last week’s amazing Warhammer Skulls trailer focused more on story, gameplay is what it all comes down to, and today we gave you almost 120 seconds of Darktide.”

Inflexion Games has released a brand new trailer for its atmospheric fantasy crafting adventure Nightingale to the Summer Game Fest showcase.
As an intrepid explorer, or &quot;Realmwalker&quot;, players will be tasked with scavenging the land, fending off wildlife and predators while gathering the ingredients necessary to craft magical decks of cards. These cards offer the power to create mysterious, dimension-crossing portals. If you thought this world and its denizens were dangerous enough, just wait until you see what&#x27;s waiting for you on the other side...
Nightingale will launch later in 2022 on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.

                              <span>All aboard the Astral Express
HoYoverse showed up at Summer Game Fest 2022 with a fresh look at Honkai: Star Rail, an upcoming turn-based space RPG that&#x27;s coming for our free time and wallets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XJGG1PCVk0Y
Today&#x27;s trailer focuses on some of the (many) companions you&#x27;ll meet and the &quot;exotic&quot; Xianzhou Luofu location. Even without context, I kind of enjoyed the sights and sounds.
As the next step in the Honkai series, Honkai: Star Rail is looking to rope in a fresh audience with its &quot;newcomer-friendly strategic turn-based combat system&quot; as well as &quot;maze exploration, puzzle-solving, and instant action elements,&quot; according to the developers.
This is my first real introduction to the game, and I am all about sipping tea while explosive space battles unfold in the background. Is this more your vibe than the usual Genshin Impact flair, or are you fully invested in Teyvat already (thanks but no thanks)? There are only so many hours in the day to make new friends, you know? Maybe a turn-based approach is more your speed, or maybe you&#x27;re just more into the interstellar vibe.
Honkai: Star Rail is coming to PC and mobile platforms, and while we don&#x27;t have a release date, the game has been getting in front of players with playtests.

                              <span>Even more turtle power
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are getting even more back-up for their next outing. Today, DotEmu locked in a launch date of June 16 for TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, and Casey Jones is joining the fray.
Today&#x27;s trailer at the Summer Game Fest showcase debuted Casey in all his hockey-masked glory. Casey will fight alongside the turtles, their master Splinter, and beat-em-up reporter April O&#x27;Neil.

Also confirmed is local and online co-op for up to six players. Yes, that means a lot of chaos on the screen all at once. But isn&#x27;t that a plus?
Six-player mayhem
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge impressed me a lot when I played it at PAX East earlier this year, and adding both more players and Casey Jones is just icing on top. Dotemu&#x27;s garnered a good reputation for brawlers at this point, with its previous work on projects like Streets of Rage 4.
With TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge though, it really feels like they&#x27;re honing in on that Saturday morning brawler feeling. In my demo, it felt fairly easy to pick up and play as anyone, and the fighters all felt very individual. After seeing April bash someone with a boom mic, I&#x27;m pretty thrilled to see what the team has concocted for Casey Jones. Add in a ton of multiplayer mayhem, and June&#x27;s looking like a good time for a couch co-op party.
The brawling gets underway next week when TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge hits PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch on June 16.

Super People aims to put a new spin on the battle royale genre with super powered characters. Each hero has their own unique abilities that will give you an advantage at different points in the game, making for a unique experience every time you play. Super People&#x27;s closed beta was finished this past December, and now, thanks to the news from the Summer Games Fest, we just learned that the open beta is available to play starting today. So far the game is only available on PC via Steam, but there&#x27;s always the chance that could change later.

As part of today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest live stream, miHoYo dropped its newest trailer for Zenless Zone Zero, the Genshin Impact-like cyber adventure set within the remnants of a devastated planet Earth.
While the previous trailer concentrated more on the overall vibe and style of the title, this new video is all about demonstrating the hard-hitting action, as our runway-savvy band of rebellious teens lay waste to hordes of dimension-crossing mutants.
Zenless Zone Zero is currently in development for PC and mobile platforms. You can register for an upcoming closed beta over on the official ZZZ website.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a teaser
In case you forgot, Warframe unveiled the Duviri Paradox back in 2019. CJ described it as possibly &quot;Warframe’s most ambitious open-world yet,&quot; and we&#x27;re going to hear more about it...in roughly a month. We got a tease today at the Summer Game Fest, but it&#x27;ll be revealed on July 16 at Tennocon.
As a second side-announcement of sorts to the bigger Duviri Paradox tease: you can pick up the Crescent Night Bundle and the Stranger&#x27;s Hood items through watching the stream on Twitch.

The card-drawing, gun-blasting, speedrunning FPS Neon White is coming in hot. Annapurna Interactive and the dev team announced Neon White has a launch date for PC and Nintendo Switch next week, on June 16.
The release date for Neon White  was shown off during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase. This speedy FPS is the new game from Donut County developer Ben Esposito and the crew at Angel Matrix. Rather than a cozy game about swallowing the world up, Neon White is about speed, execution, and anime. Just big anime vibes.

Speeding through the afterlife
The crux of Neon White is that you&#x27;re a former assassin who&#x27;s died and gone to... well, not heaven. As Neon White (the character), you&#x27;re saved from Hell to compete with other Neons in a competition for a shot at redemption.
Most of the levels take place in a dreamy paradise, with clouds and vistas abound. Oh, and demons. You want to get from point A to B as fast as possible, while also wiping out any demons you can. It feels fast and fluid, like if the Pilot&#x27;s Gauntlet from Titanfall 2 was spread out into a full game. Plus, it has a side of getting to know your fellow Neons.

The demo for it really spoke to me earlier this year, with its mix of precision FPS running and social sim side-ventures. Plus, watching a bunch of speedrunners tackle this game has been a treat in and of itself. And now that Neon White has a date, we can finally know when we&#x27;ll be able to start setting our own records on the leaderboard.
Neon White hits Nintendo Switch and PC on June 16, 2022.

Midnight Fight Express is an upcoming isometric action game from a solo developer from Poland, Jacob Dzwinel, and was announced today during the Summer Games Fest. It&#x27;s a fast-paced brawler with all kinds of weapons, dozens of pounding music tracks, and it kind of gives me Hotline Miami vibes, so if you&#x27;re into that this is one to look out for. There&#x27;s a demo up on Steam right now, and the game is officially releasing for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on August 23.

                              <span>&quot;The devs actually bothered to make an ending this time&quot;
Goat Simulator 3 entered the world with a Dead Island 2 fakeout parody trailer at Summer Game Fest 2022, and the new game is coming this fall to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC by way of the Epic Games Store. They&#x27;re skipping right over &quot;2&quot; for this direct sequel.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EKsJYDz70Ts
According to developer Coffee Stain North, Goat Simulator 3 is bringing its do-what-you-feel-like sandbox action to the island of San Angora. Best of all, there&#x27;s four-player co-op, locally and online. As intentionally dumb as Goat Simulator can be, that part actually interests me! Wacky free-roaming shenanigans can be a lot of fun with a partner.
In Goat Simulator 3, players will &quot;cause all manner of mayhem as you lick, headbutt, crash and explode your way across the map, leaving no NPC unannoyed.&quot;
The humor and slapdash physics may not feel particularly modern at this point — I sympathize with anyone who thinks this &quot;simulation&quot; has run its course — but there&#x27;s a world in which I could have some fun playing Goat Simulator 3, I think. Maybe!
I&#x27;m less interested in mini-games (there&#x27;s going to be seven types) and more on board with the idea of exploring for secrets together. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get pretty out-there with unlockable skins and &quot;gear parts&quot; if there are (*checks notes*) oh wow, 300 of &#x27;em.
Sometimes, you need a shut-off-your-brain game with low stakes and the ability to make quick, tangible progress to keep you entertained. I just hope the price is right.

Many eyes are on Summer Game Fest for being both the lengthiest and the widest-ranging presser on the horizon. But the host, Geoff Keighley, recently saw fit to temper expectations ahead of the show, saying that it won’t be flush…

                              <span>Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.
Originally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today’s reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.
The game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.
Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.
We still have something of a wait before we’ll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we’d be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.
Earlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game&#x27;s vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.</span>

                              <span>Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann took the stage at Summer Game Fest to reveal new details about HBO’s upcoming The Last of Us TV series.
First, he revealed a new still from the show, posted above, that reveals the first face shot of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey in the roles of Joel and Ellie, respectively. Prior to this, we’d only seen the characters from behind. The image comes from an episode directed by Druckmann himself, who describes the show as “the most authentic video game adaptation yet”. 
Druckmann then brought Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voice Joel and Ellie in the games, to reveal that the actors appear in the show in undisclosed roles. 
The Last of Us is set to premiere on HBO Max sometime in 2023. The show is being helmed by Druckmann and Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame.</span>

                              <span>A few weeks ago we got a 13-minute look at Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Montreal&#x27;s Arkham Knight follow-up that is scheduled to release on October 25. This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing&#x27;s gameplay.
With Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham&#x27;s streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.  In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He&#x27;s brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.
In most of the gameplay, he&#x27;s in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you&#x27;ll be able to craft by gathering specific components.
Gotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series&#x27; legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.</span>

                              <span>Deep Silver Volition has revealed the Saints Row Boss Factory character creator and it’s now live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC. 
As the name implies, the Boss Factory is a character creator separate to download from the upcoming Saints Row reboot. However, it will attach to Saints Row because the character you create now can be used as your own in Saints Row when it launches August 23. In it, you can do quite a lot too. You can adjust your body type and size, add tattoos and other cosmetics, and so much more. It even appears you can play as your boss nude, or at least close to it. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Here’s what Deep Silver Volition has to say about the experience:

                              <span>It’s not the first time Geoff Keighley, host of Summer Game Fest Live, has introduced the first-person survival crafting game, Nightingale. He first revealed the title during The Game Awards 2021. But today, he and developer Inflexion Games showed off the studio’s first title with a brand new trailer.
“For this reveal,” explains senior system designer Alexei Pepers in a blog post, “we wanted to pack the trailer with new footage and details for our community to dig into: More giants! Expanded base building! Calculating Automatons! But one new feature we felt needed a little more of a deep dive was the Realm Cards.” These cards give players the power to help craft the game’s procedural world and alter the experience. Check out everything in the video below. 


The team further explains the card-based concept for the game on their website.
Nightingale is still set to release at the end of this year on PC, but today’s trailer didn’t reveal a specific date.</span>

This news comes by way of a new trailer revealed during today’s Summer Game Fest showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and it answers a question players have been asking for a while now: Just what is Bloober Team developing? Layers of Fears is the answer, and it is a “psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2.” Bloober Team says “the psychedelic experience fans know and love will include an expanded plotline and gameplay direction all created in Unreal Engine 5.”

                              <span>At long last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge got the two things fans have been begging for: Casey Jones as a playable character and a release date that is just around the corner. 
The retro-inspired beat &#x27;em up launches on June 16. Casey has also been labeled as an unlockable character, meaning he won’t be available to use from the get-go. In another pleasant surprise, the game now has up to six-player online co-op instead of only four. Enemies also scale in size based on the number of players; expect to face a ton of Foot Clan with a six-person squad. Multiplayer also supports crossplay, so you can kick shell with friends across multiple platforms. 


You can play TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also launching on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2022/06/09/6fc18162/amarcadia2.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>After an announcement in April, today’s Summer Game Fest presentation gave us a more in-depth look at American Arcadia, the new game from Out of the Blue Games, the makers of Call of the Sea.
Players control Trevor Hills, a resident of a strange city call Arcadia, a seemingly futuristic utopia (rooted in 1970s design sensibility) in which everything looks clean and progressive. However, the city’s pristine appearance is an illusion, as the entire thing is a reality TV show for people to watch from the outside, in which one’s popularity can tank and put your actual life at risk.
Trevor is on the run from the constant surveillance, leading to what looks like a number of frantic chase scenes. In some, he’s being watched by floating drones that are tracking and recording his movements. In another sequence, we see Trevor desperately trying to stay ahead of police or security that are trying to take him in. And in yet another gameplay moment, he makes a death-defying leap from a high platform dive into a pool far below.
As the trailer wraps up, the story pans out to someone apparently outside of Arcadia, looking at the domed city from its exterior, vowing to help get him out of there. In actuality, this brief sequence is representative of the other main pillar of gameplay, in which you control a 3D first-person experience that includes hacking and puzzles. 
American Arcadia clearly draws more than just a little bit of inspiration from the classic film, The Truman Show. But the added 1970s aesthetic and focus on man-on-the-run action gives it a unique vibe. And satirizing or commenting on the questionable values of reality TV certainly feels like a timely subject.
Published by Raw Fury, American Arcadia is heading to console and PCs at a yet-to-be announced future date. Check out the full trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Even though the manga is entering its final saga next month (with years of stories to go, though), there&#x27;s plenty of One Piece content to consume in the near future. At Summer Game Fest, One Piece Odyssey, ILCA&#x27;s upcoming JRPG featuring the Straw Hat Crew, had a debut trailer introducing the cast and showing off some of the environments players can expect to explore. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, gives each confirmed Straw Hat a spotlight as their ship, the Thousand Sunny, rockets into the sky. They&#x27;re up there because of a strange cloud that forms above the seas while a Knock Up Stream kicks the ship into the air before one of Franky&#x27;s Coup De Burst propels them even closer to danger. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Chopper, Franky, Robin, Brook, and Franky are all here, although new-ish-comer Jinbei is unfortunately nowhere to be seen. 
As for in-game footage, we see some exploration of the world, and you can control more of the cast than just Monkey D. Luffy, so if you&#x27;re a big Zorro, Sanji, or Chopper fan, you&#x27;ll get to take direct control of them at some point. 
One Piece Odyssey doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but it is coming this year, according to the new trailer. It&#x27;ll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC whenever it does arrive.</span>

The superhero RPG reimagines the events of the &#x27;90s &quot;Rise of the Midnight Sons&quot; comic event by joining Marvel&#x27;s darker occult heroes, such as Blade, Magik, and Ghost Rider, with its heavy-hitters like Iron Man, Captain Marvel, and the newly revealed Spider-Man and Scarlet Witch. Players assume the role of the Hunter, an original customizable hero who serves as the key to taking down their parent and the game&#x27;s villain: Lilith, mother of all demons. 
We recently took a trip to Firaxis to play a few hours of Midnight Suns to see how it&#x27;s come along since our cover story last year. After taking on Lilith&#x27;s corrupted forces and bat…</span>

Midnight Suns is a strategic turn-based RPG featuring an interesting card-based twist, and we recently visited Firaxis Games in Baltimore, MD, to play more of it. We came away with significant takeaways, including this exciting gameplay featuring Spider-Man and Fallen Venom – a horned, demonic-looking version of the already scary antagonist. Join Alex Van Aken, Alex Stadnik, and Marcus Stewart for another look at Midnight Suns in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

                              <span>Metal: Hellsigner made an appearance today during Summer Game Fest and a demo is available now. While the trailer didn&#x27;t really show anything new, it still looks neat! You should check it out, if only because it&#x27;s a fun concept.
The big draw is its rhythm-based gameplay. While rhythm games are a dime a dozen, Hellsinger sets itself apart by being a first-person shooter, where, as you may have guessed, action has to be performed on the beat. Shooting, dodging, reloading, and so on need to be performed in time with the game&#x27;s soundtrack for maximum points. 


Speaking of the soundtrack, Hellsinger features System of a Down&#x27;s Serj Tankian, Trivium&#x27;s Matt Heafy, Lamb of God&#x27;s Randy Blythe, and more. Check out our in-depth interview with Tankian to hear more about his contributions to the game. 
A demo for Metal: Hellsigner is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.</span>

                              <span>Summer Game Fest turned strategic for a new trailer featuring Sega and Amplitude Studios&#x27; Humankind. Not only does it have a new update for the PC version and some recent DLC, but a console version of the 4X game is also coming on November 4. The footage above shows a short clip of the console version in action, but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see more of how Humankind is transitioning to controllers in the months ahead.
A new PC DLC available now is titled &quot;Cultures Of Latin America,&quot; which, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve guessed, adds new cultures, narrative events, and more based on Latin America. It costs $8.99 to add a Latin heritage to your Humankind civilizations. Here&#x27;s a handy bullet-pointed list of features for this new content drop: 
6 New Cultures: Caralans, Nazca, Taíno, Inca, Argentinians, and Cubans
6 New Wonders: Pyramid of the Sun – Teotihuacan, Maracana Stadium, Salar de Uyuni, Salto Angel, Lençóis Maranhenses, and the Atacama Desert.
9 Independent Peoples
15 Narrative Events
30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy
But that&#x27;s not all. Amplitude is releasing a &quot;major update&quot; for the PC version of Humankind today, which also implements a reworked surrender system, rebalances war support modifiers, gives infrastructure yield previews, and adds unique wonder effects. There&#x27;s even more in the update, so if you&#x27;re a Humankind fan, you have plenty to check out in the game starting today.</span>

                              <span>Today’s Summer Game Fest livestream provided a new look at Marvel’s Midnight Suns, Firaxis&#x27; upcoming superhero RPG, including a release date and two new playable heroes. 
Marvel’s Midnight Suns swings to stores on October 7, and a new cinematic trailer pulled the curtain back on Spider-Man (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal) and Scarlet Witch. These fan-favorite heroes join the likes of Ghost Rider, Captain America, and Magik to battle Lilith, Mother of all Demons. Not to be outdone by our do-gooders, the trailer also revealed Lilith&#x27;s line-up of corrupted antagonists: Venom, Sabertooth, Hulk, and interestingly, Scarlet Witch again. 


Firaxis also laid out four different versions of the game, each offering its own batch of goodies. They are:
Standard Edition ($59.99): PS4, Xbox One, and PC base game.  
Enhanced Edition ($69.99): PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version that includes five premium skins.
Digital+ Edition ($79.99): Available on all platforms and includes 11 premium skins. 
Legendary Edition ($99.99): Available on all platforms and includes 23 premium cosmetic skins plus a post-launch season pass. 
Marvel’s Midnight Suns will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Firaxis plans to launch a Switch version at a later date. We recently spent a few hours playing the game, and you can read our impressions here or watch us take on Fallen Venom in this episode of New Gameplay Today. Be sure to also catch up on our behind-the-scenes making of the game by visiting our cover story hub.</span>

                              <span>Cuphead and Mugman will soon receive much-needed help battling the forces of evil when The Delicious Last Course DLC releases on June 30. This sizable expansion introduces a new character named Ms. Chalice and the never-before-seen Inkwell Island to explore. You are tasked to help Chef Saltbaker locate the Legendary Chalice. Standing in your way are a slew of near-impossible bosses to take down.
At today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, Studio MDHR debuted new footage from The Delicious Last Course that shows an ice world and the challenges it delivers. You&#x27;ll also see how Ms. Chalice handles a pesky boss. The visuals are as beautiful and retro as you would expect, delivering the feeling that you are playing an old cartoon.
You can see some of the new footage in an official tweet from Studio MDHR:
It’s time for a real chilly thriller!!

                              <span>It’s all sunshine and rainbows at the beach until a goat set on destruction decides to ruin everything. That’s exactly what happened in the new Goat Simulator 3 trailer. 
Oddly enough, if you’ve kept up with video game news and trailers for years, the Goat Simulator 3 reveal trailer might have seemed highly familiar initially. That’s because it was riffing off of the Dead Island 2 trailer released many years ago. In that trailer, a man attempts to go for a beachside jog with headphones blasting music into his ears, and throughout the run, he’s oblivious to the zombie carnage around him. That’s exactly what happens in this Goat Simulator 3 trailer, except the big carnage-causing reveal isn’t zombies – it’s goats. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Another odd thing about the Goat Simulator 3 trailer is that the last Goat Simulator game was the first one. This means the team is completely skipping over Goat Simulator 2, it seems, which is as chaotic as the series itself. 
Goat Simulator 3 is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, this fall. 
While waiting for Goat Simulator 3, read Game Informer’s Goat Simulator review.

                              <span>Former Blizzard alumni are bringing their RTS chops to a new game from Frost Giant Studios with Stormgate. The debut trailer, which you can watch above, debuted at Summer Game Fest this afternoon.
Tim Morten, production director and CEO of Frost Giant Studios, joined Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keigley on stage to reveal a little about the new Strategy title. He describes the titular Stormgates as portals that open during solar storms that unleash the Infernal Host onto a future Earth. The trailer showed a taste of both the demonic-looking Infernal Host faction, along with the second announced race, the Human Resistance, which is represented in the footage by the archeologist, and possibly the cool-looking mech. More factions will be revealed in the future, but those were the only two Morten would confirm during today&#x27;s reveal.
Morten says Stormgate is built for approachability and is set to be free to play but won&#x27;t have any pay to win transactions or NFTs. Its also going to be designed for more social interaction. Stormgate&#x27;s campaign can be played cooperatively. It&#x27;ll also have 3-player &quot;open-ended co-op&quot; and support for 3v3 PvP battles, along with 1v1 for those who want a more personal galactic struggle.
Stormgate will be entering beta in 2023, and interested players can sign up on the game&#x27;s website for the chance to participate in the test.</span>

                              <span>Summer Game Fest has brought plenty of substantial looks at upcoming titles. The Astronauts&#x27; Witchfire is no exception. The upcoming first-person shooter is set against gothic backdrops, with fantastical creatures standing in your way. First announced back in 2017, the game has been in development for some time now, so it&#x27;s great to see it in action and inching closer to a full release. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, showed off the gunplay, the ability to freeze enemies, ways to use the environment to distract them, bow-and-arrow attacks, and a stable of other cool magical powers. Set in an alternate reality, Witchfire centers on a deadly war raging between witches and the church. 
The biggest announcement is that the game is entering Early Access soon. Right now, it is currently only announced for PC and is set to appear on the Epic Games store. So if you&#x27;re looking for a dark fantasy shooter, keep your eyes open for more details to play the game earlier.</span>

The extended demo took players on a rain-soaked through Dark Water, a mission that sees Task Force 141&#x27;s attempt to disarm a missile on an ocean oil rig. 
The video featured Soap and Ghost infiltrating the rig off the Gulf of Mexico during a ferocious storm. Their mission begins quietly as the pair, alongside new teammates such as Mexican Special Forces Operator Alejandro, stealthily picks off targets as they work towards their objective. As you may expect, things don’t go as planned. The battle escalates along with the weather as the action moves to the deck of a ship that gets tossed and turned by the violent waves. Showing off the game’s physics system, cargo crates constantly slide across the deck, providing ever-changing cover points for both the player and the enemy.  


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches on October 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Volition&#x27;s upcoming reboot of Saints Row is all about coming up in the crime business in your own way, and that includes the looks and styles displayed on your version of The Boss. In anticipation of Saints Row&#x27;s release, you&#x27;ll be able to customize your Boss in an extensive character creator called Boss Factory and bring your creation into the final game when it launches on August 23. We got our hands on the Boss Factory early and had some fun concocting our ideal crimelord.


In this edition of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Alex Stadnik, Jill Grodt, and John Carson, put the Boss Factory through its paces, creating something truly monstrous in the process. We hope you like demonic eyes and the slickest, oiliest skin that only a dip in a vat of olive oil could produce. Everything from skull shaping to gradient hair coloring, limb prosthetics, makeup, and scars are on the table; it&#x27;s really an impressive toolset for players to mess with. Because there&#x27;s so much to customize, this is an extended NGT, so sit back and enjoy the mayhem you can unleash before even stepping into the dangerous streets of Santo Ileso.
For more on the full breadth of customizations available in Saints Row, including vehicles and weapons, check out our preview on the topic. We also saw a newer build of the game in recent weeks, showing the game&#x27;s promising additions since it was delayed in February. Of course, if you haven&#x27;t read it already, Issue #340 of Game Informer features Saints Row on the cover, where we dig into an extensive hands-on preview of the title.</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol releases on December 2 and is currently on Game Informer&#x27;s newest cover. At today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, a new &quot;red band&quot; trailer debuted, alongside two gameplay sequences that show off the sci-fi horror game&#x27;s pacing, combat, and ridiculous amounts of gore. 
Protagonist Jacob Lee dishes out plenty of punishment with sci-fi weapons and a familiar looking boot stomp. The trailer above is Glen Schofield&#x27;s cut, showing just how violent and bloody the game can get. The footage below shows clips from two sequences. One with Lee in prison garb and another with him armored up and ready for war.


The Callisto Protocol is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on December 2. It&#x27;s the beginning of a new series, but for fans of Dead Space, probably looks like a sequel you&#x27;ve been waiting almost a decade to play.
What do you think of The Callisto Protocol? And how do you think EA&#x27;s Dead Space remake will stake up against it? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Last week’s Sony State of Play gave us a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated Street Fighter 6. Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation opened with a second glimpse at the game, this time to add another fighter to the roster. Guile has entered the fight.
The news should surprise precisely no one, as Guile has been a fixture of the popular fighting game franchise for decades. However, it’s always fun to see the ways that Capcom is updating their most familiar warriors for a new outing, and the new trailer gave us a look at the well-coifed martial artist.
Guile has always had ties to American culture and military elements, and that backdrop continues in the next installment. We see Guile fighting against a background environment very reminiscent of his early appearances, with a jet in the background, and the towering structure of what looks to be an aircraft carrier in the distance. Sailors and dock workers appear to gather and cheer on the fight.
Like in the first-look trailer we saw last week, Guile’s moves feature some of the same flashy painterly effects that we first saw with characters like Ryu and Chun-Li. Those bright and colorful effects are a fun contrast to the new more realistic styling of characters provided through the use of the RE engine, the same engine used to craft games like Devil May Cry 6, Monster Hunter Rise, and Resident Evil Village.
Street Fighter 6 was confirmed earlier this week to be the farthest along in the series timeline, set after the events of Street Fighter 3. As such, this new look at Guile reflects a slightly older look for the character, but don’t worry; he still takes time before his trailer concludes to whip out a comb and fix his perfectly maintained hair.
Street Fighter 6 is aiming for launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and Steam sometime in 2023. Check out the full new trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Summer Game Fest Live has had no shortage of space-themed experiences with The Callisto Protocol, Aliens: Dark Descent, Fort Solis, and more. However, host Geoff Keighly surprised viewers with one stellar game long-since thought lost to the development void: Routine. 
From Lunar Software and Raw Fury, the first-person horror all about exploring an abandoned moon base, took the stage with an unsettling new trailer. With desolate lunarscapes, dilapidated empty hallways, and a grainy, filmic vibe, the game’s latest look was set to ratchet up the tension. Its nightmarish death-dealing robot makes it stand out from the rest of the showcase’s intergalactic titles, but the short clip gives little detail on what to expect or if the game’s direction has changed significantly since we last saw it. However, we do know that composer Mick Gordon, known for his work on the Wolfenstein and Doom series, is creating its musical score. 


However, the team behind the game has already posted a message to players on their website about Routine’s long disappearance. Saying:
Routine is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, though the date has not been officially revealed.</span>

                              <span>Today, announced today during Summer Game Fest, Fallen Leaf Studio announced its debut game: Fort Solis. While details about what the game actually is were sparse, the big draw, at least according to the trailer, is the game&#x27;s acting talent. 
Roger Clark, most well known for playing Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, Troy Baker, famous for his portrayal of Joel in The Last of Us series, and Julia Brown, a TV actress known for The Alienist, all have roles in Fort Solis. 
The brief trailer serves mostly as a mood piece, showing the game&#x27;s protagonist, Wyatt Taylor (Baker), dealing with some kind of threat in the titular Fort Solis. You can see the trailer in full below:


Fallen Leaf Studio is a new developer based in Liverpool, England. Fort Solis is its first project.</span>

                              <span>Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have revealed Aliens: Dark Descent, which appears to be a tactical shooter of sorts, and it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC next year. 
Revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase, Aliens: Dark Descent is about a squad of marines trekking through a now-destroyed spacecraft on the search for an offline relay. Their goal was simple: get the relay back online, but upon entering the craft, they find it&#x27;s in ruins thanks to some Xenomorphs. And not just one Xenomorph, but multiple. It&#x27;s coming to consoles and PC sometime in 2023. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below: 


The trailer mainly was CG and featured a squad of just a few marines, but right at the end, it appeared that some gameplay footage began to play. This gameplay looked like XCOM or The Ascent in that it featured an isometric viewpoint with enemies rushing the soldiers across the screen. It looked great, but because it was just a snippet of gameplay, it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly what to expect in Aliens: Dark Descent. Focus Entertainment describes it as an &quot;enthralling single-player squad-based action game set within the iconic Aliens franchise&quot; with &quot;real-time combat.&quot; 
Here&#x27;s some additional information from Focus Entertainment: 
Focus Entertainment says players will command a squad as one unit thanks to intuitive controls, allowing Marines to automatically prioritize and execute &quot;complex actions in real-time, based on their respective skill sets and the environment around them.&quot; Players must leverage the surrounding environment to their advantage to seal off checkpoints, unlock shortcuts, and create safe zones.
Aliens: Dark Descent will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

                              <span>Among Us VR was announced last December during the Game Awards. We got a very brief glimpse of the playable space map, The Skeld, and that’s about it. Today, during the Upload VR showcase at Summer Game Fest, a hilarious gameplay trailer premiered and revealed the release period for Innersloth’s popular party game. You can watch the footage below. 


In the trailer, crewmates discuss the imposter’s identity in the Cafeteria, using their hands to emote in increasingly ridiculous ways. Like in the original game, players run around the various facilities of the arena, completing small minigames to repair or organize the scattered points of interest. The change to 3D suits the loop well and adds to the tension; there will probably be plenty of jumpscares to go around. 
Like many of you, we loved the original game, scoring it an 8.5 out of 10: 
“Among Us released over two years ago, but the jellybean/astronaut online game is currently seeing a massive surge in popularity that began in early September. The world may have started out quarantine by playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a wholesome game about friendship and taking care of our islands, but after many months of pandemic life, we’re hungry for the void of space filled with chaos and deceit.”

                              <span>The heavily rumored remake of The Last Of Us has seemingly leaked online, and it hits PlayStation 5 on Sept. 2.
This news comes from Wario64 on Twitter, who seemingly spotted a link to PlayStation Direct that houses pre-orders for the game, which is now called The Last Of Us Part 1, and its reveal trailer. As you might expect, it looks gorgeous. The remake will also include the entire game and the Left Behind DLC. Plus, it&#x27;s also in development for PC, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the PC release will be happening simultaneously with the PS5 release. 
You can check out the trailer for yourself below: 


The pre-order page reveals the standard PS5 edition will cost $69.99, while the special Firefly Edition will cost $99.99. It&#x27;s unclear what the Firefly Edition will contain, as the page linked to it in Wario64&#x27;s tweet no longer takes you to The Last Of Us Part 1. 
Here&#x27;s a blurb of the game Wario64 caught on the listing: 
And here are some shots of the listing, as well as in-game screenshots, from Wario64: 

It&#x27;s unclear what exactly happened here – perhaps this was set to be revealed during today&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase, or maybe Sony had other plans and accidentally hit the &quot;go live&quot; button on its website. Regardless, Wario64 caught it before that page went down.

                              <span>Microsoft revealed today that a new Xbox app for 2022 Samsung Smart TVs will let Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers stream their games. However, that’s not all the company had to reveal today. 
In a new Xbox Wire blog post, Microsoft discusses Project Moorcroft, which is seemingly its take on the PlayStation Plus Game Trials system launching with the revamped service on June 13. According to the blog post, the program will bring “the fun and discovery of playing new, curated demos of upcoming games to our Xbox Game Pass members,” and it will begin rolling out next year. It will start with “a focus on providing independent developers from around the world more opportunities to build excitement for their games.” 
Xbox says participating developers will be able to see how their demos perform, and the company will compensate them too, “enabling them to bring their creativity to Xbox and reach new audiences with Game Pass.” Xbox also says that later this year, “it’s our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play, from the cloud, select games they already own or have purchased outside the Xbox Game Pass library.” 
Elsewhere in the blog post, Microsoft has revealed new colors for Xbox Design Lab. They include Soft Pink, Soft Orange, Soft Green, and Soft Purple. There are new Camo Top cases with matching side caps, too, including Mineral Camo, Arctic Camo, Forest Camo, Sandglow Camo, and Blaze Camo. Xbox Design Lab is launching in 11 new countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, and Switzerland. Xbox Design Lab will come to Taiwan later this summer.

                              <span>According to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. 
This wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. 
Forza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: 
“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”
Are you excited about the alleged crossover?

                              <span>Sony officially announced three TV shows last month – a God of War series at Amazon, a Gran Turismo show, and a Horizon series coming to Netflix – and these three joined the already-in-production Twisted Metal TV series. The latter has received plenty of updates, such as word that Anthony Mackie will star and Will Arnett will voice Sweet Tooth. Details about these other shows, though, have remained unknown. 
However, new details about Netflix’s Horizon show have reportedly leaked, including that it will be called Horizon 2074. This news comes from GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb, as reported by Eurogamer. Grubb said Horizon 2074 will be “split between the timeline you see in the games and the timeline of where things begin to fall.” 


He also said the idea is that the series will not be “a reboot or remake or reimagining of the game’s storyline” but will instead “take place parallel and explain other elements that happen,” according to Eurogamer. 
If Grubb’s leaked details end up being true – mind you, this show sounds very early in production, so some things could change as well – then it sounds like we’ll be getting a lot of backstory and lore related to the fall of humanity. We might also learn how Earth gets to where it is at the start of Horizon Zero Dawn. Only time will tell for now.

                              <span>We first heard the news of Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s anime two years ago, months before the sci-fi RPG&#x27;s official release. Today, a new and gory mini trailer revealed the flashy grittiness of the upcoming Netflix show.


The Maelstrom gang is displayed in the short clip (seen above). The criminal faction, known for its obsession with prosthetic enhancements, conducts a ransom deal with a group of unnamed protagonists. A woman is stowed away in a small, fridge-like contraption until she&#x27;s quickly rescued. This is Night City, after all, so violence ensues. Limbs are hacked off and blown to bits in eye-popping fashion, which might be no surprise as the acclaimed Studio Trigger (Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, Promare) is responsible for the art direction and animation. We can&#x27;t hear any dialogue as cacophonic guitar riffs add flavor to the bloody action. Even so, the shocking violence and heavy atmosphere are reminiscent of CD Projekt Red&#x27;s vision. 
Not much is known about the anime, but the Netflix blurb in the YouTube video reads as follows:
&quot;The series tells a standalone, 10-episode story about a street kid trying to survive in Night City – a technology and body modification-obsessed city of the future. Having everything to lose, he stays alive by becoming an edgerunner – a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.&quot; 
The show will exist in the same universe as the game, so come September, we might even get to see or hear about V&#x27;s exploits!

The company revealed in a new Xbox Wire blog post that 2022 Samsung Smart TVs would be getting an Xbox app that allows Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream games directly from the TV, no dongle or plug-in required, on June 30. There were plenty of rumors regarding a TV integration like this in the months leading up to Xbox&#x27;s official reveal that it was planning to do just that, so it&#x27;s not surprising it&#x27;s finally happening.

                              <span>Halo Infinite released last November after a year-long delay from its initial 2020 release. Still, it did not launch with a few highly anticipated features like campaign co-op, online and split-screen, and Forge. 
In February, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten announced that the team was delaying an update regarding those modes planned for January. That update finally arrived in March, with the unfortunate news that campaign co-op and Forge had been pushed back to an unspecified date. Now, we have a new update regarding co-op: Halo Insiders can participate in a campaign network co-op flight in July. 
“With Halo Infinite campaign network co-op arriving later this year, we’re planning to flight it to Halo Insiders in July,” a tweet from the Halo Twitter account reads. “Register and make sure your Halo Insider profile is up to date for a chance to participate.”

You can do that here. As for what to expect, it sounds like this will be a Halo Infinite campaign network co-op beta meaning you’ll be able to try online co-op, (not to be confused with split-screen). If you’re interested, be sure to update your Halo Insider details or sign up if you’ve never done that before.

                              <span>There was much interest in the recent Python 3.11 beta benchmarks showing much performance uplift from this in-development version of Python compared to prior 3.x releases. While Python 3.11 performance is looking great and huge advantages compared to prior versions, there are also alternative Python implementations like PyPy and Pyston. Stemming from Phoronix reader requests, here are benchmarks showing how Python 3.11 beta performance compares to those alternative Python implementations.</span>

                              <span>Diablo Immortal is being pilloried by players for the price of its microtransactions, and for how closely tied your progress is to spending real money. One player on the game&#x27;s Reddit page has suggested that it would cost between $50k-$80k (around £39k-£64k) to fully max out a character in the free-to-play action RPG. Meanwhile, the game&#x27;s director has been responding to feedback on Twitter in an attempt to address those &quot;not liking a game based on misinformation surrounding it.&quot;

                              <span>One of my favourite gaming keyboards is discounted at Amazon UK today. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed TKL is an ultra-slim, low profile mechanical keyboard that feels like the best laptop keyboard you&#x27;ve ever used. Lightspeed means Logitech&#x27;s reliable 2.4GHz wireless, while &#x27;TKL&#x27; stands for tenkeyless, a compact design that ditches the numpad for superior ergonomics and longer battery life. 
Altogether, it&#x27;s a beautifully-designed mechanical keyboard, with a high price point being the only strike against it - and despite that, the full-size G915 has been our &#x27;best wireless keyboard&#x27; recommendation for three years running. Today though, the G915 Lightspeed TKL is down to £109 after a £90 discount, making it an excellent time to upgrade your setup with a swanky new keyboard.

It debuted at £110 but now costs £57, nearly half-off its UK RRP. This headset distinguishes itself with a comfortable design, good neutral sound and a choice of leatherette or velour ear pads - with the latter being a godsend for spectacle-wearers like myself.

                              <span>Owning Halo Infinite is like having a subscription to a magazine where each issue has part of a model stuck to the front. The first issue brought the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes, the second issue brought its singleplayer campaign, the third issue finally fixed its Big Team Battle mode, and the fourth issue - by which time you&#x27;ve possibly lost interest - will bring online co-op for its campaign.

If you&#x27;re one of those still reading this metaphorical magazine, you can get beta access to the co-op mode this July if you sign up to Halo Insider.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is coming later this year, but progress and inventories won&#x27;t carry across from the existing Warzone. Instead, it&#x27;ll be a fresh start and will run concurrently alongside the existing game. Infinity Ward offered a few details of the new game as part of their reveal of Modern Warfare 2 earlier this evening.

                              <span>In a more traditional manner than plastering faces on the decks of boats, Infinity Ward have released the first proper trailer for their remkae of Modern Warfare 2. It&#x27;ll launch on October 28th - and unlike recent Call Of Duty games, it&#x27;ll be coming to Steam.

                              <span>Is there a name for the subgenre of games divided into little levels where you try, die to a seemingly impossible challenge, instantly retry with a button press, die, then retry and die over and over until you nail it and feel like an absolute champion? Disc Room is one of those games, and it&#x27;s a good one. First released in 2020, it hit Game Pass this week, inviting more folks to dodge through a giant alien spaceship filled with buzzsaws. I certainly recommend having a go and discovering what your insides look like.

                              <span>When I look outside my window, I often see our two cats scrabbling up our back wall as they hop over the fence to visit the neighbour&#x27;s garden. Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It&#x27;s an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.
&quot;About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it,&quot; says producer Swann Martin-Raget. &quot;We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director&#x27;s cats called Murtaugh. He&#x27;s not an exact copy, but he&#x27;s the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he&#x27;s a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we&#x27;ve adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us.&quot;

A site called Try Hard Guides say they’ve allegedly received early footage of the game, which is called Overdose. Details are very thin on the ground otherwise, but hey, Koj has been teasing a new horror game for months now, so maybe we&#x27;ll see something emerge from the mists during one of this week&#x27;s notE3 streams.

                              <span>This review mentions that you get three do-overs to save a character&#x27;s life. This is only available in your first play through in the deluxe version of the game, which I wasn&#x27;t aware I was reviewing. The feature unlocks in the standard version after you&#x27;ve completed a full play through.
I&#x27;m going to do my absolute best to tell you about The Quarry with no spoilers, but it will be hard because a lot of what marks it out as better and cleverer and funner than comparable horrorventure romps is all tangled up in the plot. It&#x27;s an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot. Broadly, it is the story of a group of camp counselors, one night in a quarry-based summer camp, and how baffling organisational choice can lead to ruin.

                              <span>Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.
It turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office&#x27;s inquiry on the option to add mandatory copyright protection measures in the DMCA has led to some interesting responses. They include a suggestion to add &quot;VPN detection&quot; tools to prevent people from engaging in &quot;geo-piracy&quot;. This request, unsurprisingly, comes from a company that offers a VPN detection service.

Unusually, it will be independently audited to assess over-blocking and any user circumvention via VPNs.

In a message from Oda yesterday, the mangaka announced the hiatus of the series will follow chapter 1053, which is scheduled to hit on June 26. At that time, no new chapters of One Piece would be available for an entire month, an almost unprecedented length of time for the pirating adventures, save for a similar gap when the series made a two-year time skip in the…</span>

Operatives everywhere toured Chernobyl&#x27;s dilapidated theme park in nothing but a ghillie suit, stumbled through the residual radioactive smog of a detonated nuclear warhead, stormed a Kazakhstan stronghold under intense blizzard cover, and saved the world with a single, well-aimed throwing knife. 
Seemingly overnight, Modern Warfare established itself as a household name, defining the coming generatio…</span>

Today, however, Techland revealed that its support for Dying Light is coming to a close, but not without one last surprise. The studio rounded up all of its support for the game in a brand new Dying Light: Definitive Edition that&#x27;s out tomorrow.

                              <span>Howdy partner. There&#x27;s something of a power supply showdown right now, and no one knows who&#x27;s gonna blink first. Newegg dropped their price on the EVGA Supernova 1000 G6 PSU to $140, and Amazon followed suit soon after. That&#x27;s $50 below the usual price of $190, and a historic low for this model.
If you&#x27;ve got a high-end system - or you&#x27;re planning to pick up a power-hungry next-gen graphics card when they launch later this year - then this is an awesome upgrade.

We&#x27;ve seen price drops on the higher-end models recently, as next-gen GPU rumours have begun to build steam, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a great mid-range option receive the same treatment so I thought it was worth writing about!

                              <span>There have been more auspicious PC game launches than that of Diablo Immortal. Originally revealed to a booing crowd as a mobile-only, MMO-styled take on the APRG series, its later-announced Windows release has revealed the full extent of a F2P monetisation system that ties immensely powerful Legendary Gem upgrades to costly loot boxes. Not a great look, especially coming from a company facing multiple lawsuits, staff walkouts and sexual harassment allegations.


Strictly speaking, the PC version of Diablo Immortal is in open beta, with only the mobile version launching as the finished article. The good news is that this leaves more room for the technical issues and oversights I’ve encountered to be fixed; the bad news is that they exist in the first place, and range from absent PC settings staples to repeating performance hiccups.

                              <span>Most video games about cards are deck-building strategy games. Digitised Magic The Gathering-likes. Card Shark is a card game about playing cards, and, more specifically, about cheating at playing cards. When I previewed it I said that it turned out I was quite good at cheating, but now I have played the full build I can report that I&#x27;m bad at that, too. The worst I can say about Card Shark is that it doesn&#x27;t make failure fun.

The confirmation means that the KWS Edmonton United group become the first games industry professionals to unionise in Canada. Their decision follows on from the Game Workers Alliance group’s successful vote last month to unionise at Actvision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software in Wisconsin, the first notable such group in the US to do so.

                              <span>The Ni No Kuni series has always been beautiful. With its Studio Ghibli-esque styling, imaginative character designs and amazing music made by the legend that is Joe Hisaishi, its world is a true joy to immerse yourself in. It’s why I’m ultimately so disappointed by Cross Worlds. Netmarble has taken this pure, effervescent fantasy dream land and pushed it off the monkeybars into a steaming pile of gacha mechanics and crypto currencies.
To be fair, it’s not all bad. Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad. There’s a wonderful glimpse of something amazing that just never materialises as the mirk of mobile-based gameplay is just too thick to get through.

                              <span>Summer Game Fest organiser Geoff Keighley has advised people tuning in to this Thursday’s showcase not to expect any “megaton shock” game announcements. The stunning revelation that maybe you shouldn’t expect too many brand-new AAA game reveals following a global pandemic came through an audio broadcast on Twitter Spaces over the weekend, transcribed by VGC. “We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,” Keighley said, “but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I’m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.”

Both editions can be accessed from the Minecraft launcher. They’ll retain their respective features and stay separate from one another.

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. 
What I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.

                              <span>Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve sampled so many retro-styled FPSes, I&#x27;d class it as a form of training. I&#x27;m now attuned to their look, their pacing, their good and bad points. So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that&#x27;s very Doom 3.
What&#x27;s nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he&#x27;s a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn&#x27;t happen and we had a pretty swell time, I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s early days for the game but there&#x27;s potential there.

                              <span>Hosting provider LeaseWeb is being sued for copyright infringement at a federal court in California. The lawsuit was filed by photographer Barry Rosen who argues that Leaseweb failed to take action against &quot;infringing&quot; poster sites, despite receiving repeated DMCA notices. The owners of the infringing sites are unknown and listed as Doe defendants.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.

That&#x27;s right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.

The German Federal Court of Justice came to this conclusion based on advice from the EU&#x27;s top court. Several liability lawsuits will now besent back to the lower court to decide whether damages are indeed warranted.

The second target, Manganelo.com, is a comparatively smaller player with &#x27;just&#x27; 24 million visits per month.

By their powers combined we manage to create an absolutely nightmarish dystopian society where people live forever but cannot put more than four of the same thing in a line. It&#x27;s bleak. Games should stay in games.

This means I&#x27;m at work today and Friday. For other people outside the UK who don&#x27;t know, this weekend it is celebrating the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. She&#x27;s the first UK monarch to manage 70 years on the throne, most of the other ones having killed each other or somesuch. The country, specifically England, has responded to this by going absolutely off the boil, represented even in digi-form with a virtual street party map in Minecraft. I wouldn&#x27;t normally write about it, but it gives me an excuse to republican-post on main when nobody is looking.

                              <span>Seregios can get stuffed. I recently faced off against the massive golden dragon during a hands-on session for Sunbreak, the upcoming expansion pack for Monster Hunter Rise, and it battered me repeatedly for the best part of an hour. It has become the flying white whale to my dual blade wielding Ahab, and I left the preview event determined to chop it to bits when the DLC finally arrives later this month.


Sunbreak’s new master rank quests aren’t messing around, basically. It seems Capcom have taken criticisms that the base version of Monster Hunter Rise didn’t provide challenging enough end-game content to heart, and have loaded the expansion with some truly agonising encounters purpose-built for returning veterans.

                              <span>Before the UK passed the Digital Economy Act in 2017, critics warned that categorizing file-sharers as criminals would encourage &quot;copyright trolls&quot; to demand cash settlements while implying a criminal conviction might be an alternative. The government didn&#x27;t listen and it is now happening. One of the parties involved is FACT, the company behind the infamous &#x27;Piracy, It&#x27;s a Crime&#x27; campaign.

                              <span>Ever have an idea that you regret the instant you commit to realising it? That&#x27;s how I feel about my decision to rank all of Elden Ring&#x27;s major locations. It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That&#x27;s not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.
Yet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you&#x27;ll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring&#x27;s major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software&#x27;s magnificent fantasy realm.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of my favourite SSDs, as you might know from me writing about it last week. . Then, I was happy to announce that this rapid 1TB PCIe 4.0 drive had made it to £100 - a price it&#x27;s gotten near a few times before but not stayed at with any regularity. You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I discovered that Crucial are now selling the same drive at their site for £80.69 - a genuine bargain and the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen by some margin.

To rule out bias, Spinrilla wants to ask potential jury members if they have ever worked in the music industry. The labels, meanwhile, want to know whether the jurors have DJ experience, are hip-hop fans, or support EFF.

                              <span>Jak jsme na tom s řízením kybernetické bezpečnosti. Broadcom převezme VMware za 61 miliard dolarů. Nový IT normál? Cloudové služby, edge computing a automatizace. Téměř polovina finančních ředitelů považuje samoobslužná data a analytiku za hnací sílu produktivity zaměstnanců. Elektroniku čeká další zdražování, zejména kvůli růstu cen čipů. Zdokonalovat lze i kvantové simulátory.</span>

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!
